12	Anarchism is often defined as a political philosophy which holds the state to be undesirable, unnecessary, or harmful.
12	However, others argue that while anti-statism is central, it is inadequate to define anarchism.
12	Therefore, they argue instead that anarchism entails opposing authority or hierarchical organization in the conduct of human relations, including, but not only, the state system.
12	Proponents of anarchism, known as "anarchists", advocate stateless societies based on non-hierarchical free associations.
12	As a subtle and anti-dogmatic philosophy, anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy.
12	Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy.
12	There are many types and traditions of anarchism, not all of which are mutually exclusive.
12	Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism.
12	Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications.
12	Anarchism is often considered a radical left-wing ideology, and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflect anti-authoritarian interpretations of communism, collectivism, syndicalism, mutualism, or participatory economics.
12	Anarchism as a mass social movement has regularly endured fluctuations in popularity.
12	The central tendency of anarchism as a social movement has been represented by anarcho-communism and anarcho-syndicalism, with individualist anarchism being primarily a literary phenomenon which nevertheless did have an impact on the bigger currents and individualists have also participated in large anarchist organizations.
12	Many anarchists oppose all forms of aggression, supporting self-defense or non-violence (anarcho-pacifism), while others have supported the use of some coercive measures, including violent revolution and propaganda of the deed, on the path to an anarchist society.
12	Etymology and terminology The term anarchism derives from the ancient Greek ἄναρχος, anarchos, meaning "without rulers", from the prefix ἀν- (an-, "without") + ἀρχός (arkhos, "leader", from ἀρχή arkhē, "authority, sovereignty, realm, magistracy") + -ισμός (-ismos, from the suffix -ιζειν, -izein "-izing").
12	"Anarchists" was the term adopted by Maximilien de Robespierre to attack those on the left whom he had used for his own ends during the French Revolution but was determined to get rid of, though among these "anarchists" there were few who exhibited the social revolt characteristics of later anarchists.
12	There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, such as William Godwin and Wilhelm Weitling, but they did not use the word "anarchist" or "anarchism" in describing themselves or their beliefs.
12	Pierre-Joseph Proudhon was the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist, making the formal birth of anarchism the mid-nineteenth century.
12	Since the 1890s from France, the term "libertarianism" has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the 1950s in the United States; its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States.
12	On the other hand, some use "libertarianism" to refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only, referring to free-market anarchism as "libertarian anarchism".
12	History Origins The earliest anarchist themes can be found in the 6th century BC, among the works of Taoist philosopher Laozi, and in later centuries by Zhuangzi and Bao Jingyan.
12	Zhuangzi's philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist.
12	Zhuangzi wrote, "A petty thief is put in jail.
12	A great brigand becomes a ruler of a Nation."
12	Diogenes of Sinope and the Cynics, their contemporary Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism, also introduced similar topics.
12	Jesus is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the Christian anarchist tradition.
12	Georges Lechartier wrote that "The true founder of anarchy was Jesus Christ and ...
12	" Such a distinction reverberates subversive religious conceptions like the aforementioned seemingly anarchistic Taoist teachings and that of other anti-authoritarian religious traditions creating a complex relationship regarding the question as to whether or not anarchism and religion are compatible.
12	This is exemplified when the glorification of the state is viewed as a form of sinful idolatry.
12	The French renaissance political philosopher Étienne de La Boétie has been said to write an important anarchist precedent in his most famous work the Discourse on Voluntary Servitude.
12	The radical Protestant Christian Gerrard Winstanley and his group the Diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in England.
12	The term "anarchist" first entered the English language in 1642, during the English Civil War, as a term of abuse, used by Royalists against their Roundhead opponents.
12	By the time of the French Revolution some, such as the Enragés, began to use the term positively, in opposition to Jacobin centralisation of power, seeing "revolutionary government" as oxymoronic.
12	By the turn of the 19th century, the English word "anarchism" had lost its initial negative connotation.
12	Modern anarchism sprang from the secular or religious thought of the Enlightenment, particularly Jean-Jacques Rousseau's arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.
12	There were a variety of anarchist currents during the French Revolution, with some revolutionaries using the term "anarchiste" in a positive light as early as September 1793.
12	The enragés opposed revolutionary government as a contradiction in terms.
12	Denouncing the Jacobin dictatorship, Jean Varlet wrote in 1794 that "government and revolution are incompatible, unless the people wishes to set its constituted authorities in permanent insurrection against itself."
12	During the French Revolution, Sylvain Maréchal, in his Manifesto of the Equals (1796), demanded "the communal enjoyment of the fruits of the earth" and looked forward to the disappearance of "the revolting distinction of rich and poor, of great and small, of masters and valets, of governors and governed."
12	From this climate William Godwin developed what many consider the first expression of modern anarchist thought.
12	Godwin was, according to Peter Kropotkin, "the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work", while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early Edmund Burke.
12	Benjamin Tucker instead credits Josiah Warren, an American who promoted stateless and voluntary communities where all goods and services were private, with being "the first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as Anarchism."
12	The first to describe himself as an anarchist was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, a French philosopher and politician, which led some to call him the founder of modern anarchist theory.
12	The anarcho-communist Joseph Déjacque was the first person to describe himself as "libertarian".
12	Unlike Proudhon, he argued that, "it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature."
12	In 1844 in Germany the post-hegelian philosopher Max Stirner published the book The Ego and Its Own which will later be considered an influential early text of individualist anarchism.
12	Anarchists active in the 1848 Revolution in France, included Anselme Bellegarrigue, Ernest Coeurderoy, Joseph Déjacque and Pierre Joseph Proudhon.
12	First International and the Paris Commune In Europe, harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848, during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings.
12	After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists, anarchists, liberals, and nanservative elements took advtionalists, to prevent further revolt.
12	In 1864 the International Workingmen's Association (sometimes called the "First International") united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of Proudhon, Blanquists, Philadelphes, English trade unionists, socialists and social democrats.
12	Due to its links to active workers' movements, the International became a significant organization.
12	Karl Marx became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council.
12	Proudhon's followers, the mutualists, opposed Marx's state socialism, advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings.
12	In 1868, following their unsuccessful participation in the League of Peace and Freedom (LPF), Russian revolutionary Mikhail Bakunin and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the First International (which had decided not to get involved with the LPF).
12	They allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the International, who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property.
12	At first, the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction.
12	Subsequently, the International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads.
12	Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as centralist and predicted that, if a Marxist party came to power, its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against.
12	Anarchist historian George Woodcock reports that "The annual Congress of the International had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the Paris Commune, and in 1871 the General Council called only a special conference in London.
12	One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy, while a technical excuse - that they had split away from the Fédération Romande - was used to avoid inviting Bakunin's Swiss supporters.
12	Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present, and the General Council's resolutions passed almost unanimously.
12	Most of them were clearly directed against Bakunin and his followers."
12	In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the Hague Congress, where Bakunin and James Guillaume were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York.
12	In response, the federalist sections formed their own International at the St.
12	Imier Congress, adopting a revolutionary anarchist program.
12	The Paris Commune was a government that briefly ruled Paris from 18 March (more formally, from 28 March) to 28 May 1871.
12	The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War.
12	Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune.
12	They included  George Woodcock manifests that  Organized labor The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists, seeking to "replace the privilege and authority of the State" with the "free and spontaneous organization of labor."
12	In 1886, the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions (FOTLU) of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886, as the date by which the eight-hour work day would become standard.
12	In response, unions across the United States prepared a general strike in support of the event.
12	On 3 May, in Chicago, a fight broke out when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line, and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd.
12	The next day, 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's Haymarket Square.
12	T; A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer.
12	In the ensuing panic, police opened fire on the crowd and each other.
12	Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed.
12	Eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer.
12	The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement.
12	Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution.
12	The incident became known as the Haymarket affair, and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day.
12	In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in scope, to organise for the eight-hour day was made.
12	The event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair.
12	Although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event, by the following year the celebration of International Workers' Day on May Day had become firmly established as an international worker's holiday.
12	In 1907, the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the anarchist movement, including Errico Malatesta, Pierre Monatte, Luigi Fabbri, Benoît Broutchoux, Emma Goldman, Rudolf Rocker, and Christiaan Cornelissen.
12	Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, popular education issues, the general strike or antimilitarism.
12	A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism (or trade unionism).
12	Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution, while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient.
12	He thought that the trade-union movement was reformist and even conservative, citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials.
12	Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.
12	The Spanish Workers Federation in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain.
12	The most successful was the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910.
12	Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics, attracting 1.58 million members at one point and playing a major role in the Spanish Civil War.
12	The CNT was affiliated with the International Workers Association, a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America.
12	In Latin America in particular "The anarchists quickly became active in organizing craft and industrial workers throughout South and Central America, and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Chile, and Argentina were anarcho-syndicalist in general outlook; the prestige of the Spanish C.N.T.
12	The largest and most militant of these organizations was the Federación Obrera Regional Argentina ...
12	" Propaganda of the deed and illegalism Some anarchists, such as Johann Most, advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because "we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda."
12	By the 1880s, people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan, "propaganda of the deed" to refer to individual bombings, regicides, and tyrannicides.
12	From 1905 onwards, the Russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal 'expropriations'."
12	Illegalism as a practice emerged and within it "The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins ("propaganda by the deed") and the anarchist burglars ("individual reappropriation") expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society.
12	Moreover, they were clearly meant to be exemplary invitations to revolt.".
12	France's Bonnot Gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism.
12	However, as soon as 1887, important figures in the as the most famous anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts.
12	Peter Kropotkin thus wrote that year in Le Révolté that "a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite".
12	A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favor of collective revolutionary action, for example through the trade union movement.
12	The anarcho-syndicalist, Fernand Pelloutier, argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labor movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without "the individual dynamiter."
12	State repression (including the infamous 1894 French lois scélérates) of the anarchist and labor movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts.
12	The dismemberment of the French socialist movement, into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 Paris Commune, the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies, favored individualist political expression and acts.
12	Numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement.
12	For example, U.S.
12	President McKinley's assassin Leon Czolgosz claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and feminist Emma Goldman.
12	Bombings were associated in the media with anarchists because international terrorism arose during this time period with the widespread distribution of dynamite.
12	This image remains to this day.
12	Propaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after World War I (1914–1918) and the 1917 October Revolution.
12	Russian Revolution and other uprisings of the 1910s Anarchists participated alongside the Bolsheviks in both February and October revolutions, and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution.
12	However, following a political falling out with the Bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, the conflict culminated in the 1921 Kronstadt rebellion, which the new government repressed.
12	Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks; the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to the Ukraine.
12	There, in the Free Territory, they fought in the civil war against the Whites (a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution) and then the Bolsheviks as part of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine led by Nestor Makhno, who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.
12	Expelled American anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising, before they left Russia.
12	Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia, criticizing the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised.
12	For them, Bakunin's predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new "socialist" Marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true.
12	The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally.
12	Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements.
12	In France and the United States, for example, members of the major syndicalist movements of the CGT and IWW left the organizations and joined the Communist International.
12	The revolutionary wave of 1917–23 saw the active participation of anarchists in varyutions of 1917–23|revolutionaring degrees of protagonism.
12	In the German uprising known as the German Revolution of 1918–1919 which established the Bavarian Soviet Republic the anarchists Gustav Landauer, Silvio Gesell and Erich Mühsam had important leadership positions within the revolutionary councilist structures.
12	In the Italian events known as the biennio rosso the anarcho-syndicalist trade union Unione Sindacale Italiana "grew to 800,000 members and the influence of the Italian Anarchist Union (20,000 members plus Umanita Nova, its daily paper) grew accordingly ...
12	Anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces.
12	In the Mexican Revolution the Mexican Liberal Party was established and during the early 1910s it lead a series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in Baja California with the leadership of anarcho-communist Ricardo Flores Magón.
12	In Paris, the Dielo Truda group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included Nestor Makhno, concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism.
12	Their 1926 manifesto, called the Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft), was supported.
12	Platformist groups active today include the Workers Solidarity Movement in Ireland and the North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists of North America.
12	Synthesis anarchism emerged as an organizational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives.
12	In the 1920s this form found as its main proponents Volin and Sebastien Faure.
12	It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global International of Anarchist Federations.
12	Conflicts with European fascist regimes In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of fascism in Europe transformed anarchism's conflict with the state.
12	Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists.
12	Italian anarchists played a key role in the anti-fascist organisation Arditi del Popolo, which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions, and achieved some success in their activism, such as repelling Blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of Parma in August 1922.
12	The veteran Italian anarchist, Luigi Fabbri, was one of the first critical theorists of fascism, describing it as "the preventive counter-revolution."
12	In France, where the far right leagues came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a united front policy.
12	Anarchists in France and Italy were active in the Resistance during World War II.
12	In Germany the anarchist Erich Mühsam was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of 28 February 1933, within a few hours after the Reichstag fire in Berlin.
12	Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister, labelled him as one of "those Jewish subversives."
12	Over the next seventeen months, he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at Sonnenburg, Brandenburg and finally, Oranienburg.
12	On 2 February 1934, Mühsam was transferred to the concentration camp at Oranienburg when finally on the night of 9 July 1934, Mühsam was tortured and murdered by the guards, his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning.
12	Spanish Revolution  In Spain, the national anarcho-syndicalist trade union Confederación Nacional del Trabajo initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory.
12	But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power.
12	Months later, the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939).
12	In response to the army rebellion, an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain where they collectivised the land.
12	But even before the fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the Stalinists, who controlled the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from the Soviet Union.
12	The events known as the Spanish Revolution was a workers' social revolution that began during the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organizational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years, primarily Catalonia, Aragon, Andalusia, and parts of the Levante.
12	Much of Spain's economy was put under worker control; in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia, the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy Communist Party of Spain influence, as the Soviet-allied party actively resisted attempts at collectivization enactment.
12	Factories were run through worker committees, agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes.
12	Anarchist historian Sam Dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution, which he claimed "came closer to realizing the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history."
12	Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident Marxists and anarchists.
12	The prominent Italian anarchist Camillo Berneri, who volunteered to fight against Franco was killed instead in Spain by gunmen associated with the Spanish Communist Party.
12	Post-war years   Anarchism sought to reorganize itself after the war.
12	The Mexican Anarchist Federation was established in 1945 after the Anarchist Federation of the Center united with the Anarchist Federation of the Federal District.
12	In the early 1940s, the Antifascist International Solidarity and the Federation of Anarchist Groups of Cuba merged into the large national organization Asociación Libertaria de Cuba (Cuban Libertarian Association).
12	From 1944 to 1947, the Bulgarian Anarchist Communist Federation reemerged as part of a factory and workplace committee movement, but was repressed by the new Communist regime.
12	In 1945 in France the Fédération Anarchiste was established and the also synthesist Federazione Anarchica Italiana was founded in Italy.
12	Korean anarchists formed the League of Free Social Constructors in September 1945 and in 1946 the Japanese Anarchist Federation was founded.
12	An International Anarchist Congress with delegates from across Europe was held in Paris in May 1948.
12	After World War II, an appeal in the Fraye Arbeter Shtime detailing the plight of German anarchists and called for Americans to support them.
12	By February 1946, the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in Germany was a large-scale operation.
12	The Federation of Libertarian Socialists  was founded in Germany in 1947 and Rudolf Rocker wrote for its organ, Die Freie Gesellschaft, which survived until 1953.
12	In 1956 the Uruguayan Anarchist Federation was founded.
12	In 1955 the Anarcho-Communist Federation of Argentina renamed itself as the Argentine Libertarian Federation.
12	The organizational debate between synthesis anarchism and platformism took importance once again especially in the anarchist movements of Italy and France.
12	Anarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time, such as Albert Camus, Herbert Read, Paul Goodman, Dwight Macdonald, Allen Ginsberg, George Woodcock, Julian Beck—and the French Surrealist group led by André Breton, which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the Fédération Anarchiste.
12	Anarcho-pacifism became influential in the Anti-nuclear movement and anti war movements of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the English anarchist member of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Alex Comfort or the similar activism of the American catholic anarcho-pacifists  Ammon Hennacy and Dorothy Day.
12	Anarcho-pacifism became a "basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the Cold War."
12	The resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in Robert Graham's Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas, Volume Two: The Emergence of the New Anarchism (1939–1977).
12	Contemporary anarchism  A surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the 1960s and 1970s.
12	Anarchism was influential in the Counterculture of the 1960s and anarchists actively participated in the late sixties students and workers revolts.
12	In 1968 in Carrara, Italy the International of Anarchist Federations was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing European federations of France (the Fédération Anarchiste), the Federazione Anarchica Italiana of Italy and the Iberian Anarchist Federation as well as the Bulgarian federation in French exile.
12	In the United Kingdom in the 1970s this was associated with the punk rock movement, as exemplified by bands such as Crass and the Sex Pistols.
12	The housing and employment crisis in most of Western Europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of Barcelona, Spain.
12	In Denmark, squatters occupied a disused military base and declared the Freetown Christiania, an autonomous haven in central Copenhagen.
12	Since the revival of anarchism in the mid 20th century, a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged.
12	Although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of anarcha-feminism, they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the 1960s.
12	The American Civil Rights Movement and the movement against the war in Vietnam also contributed to the revival of North American anarchism.
12	European anarchism of the late 20th century drew much of its strength from the labour movement, and both have incorporated animal rights activism.
12	Anarchist anthropologist David Graeber and anarchist historian Andrej Grubacic have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism, with those "who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits" of the 19th century contrasted with the younger activists who are "much more informed, among other elements, by indigenous, feminist, ecological and cultural-critical ideas", and who by the turn of the 21st century formed "by far the majority" of anarchists.
12	Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti-capitalist, and anti-globalisation movements.
12	Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Group of Eight, and the World Economic Forum.
12	Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction, and violent confrontations with police.
12	These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as black blocs; other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture, affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet.
12	A significant event of this period was the confrontations at WTO conference in Seattle in 1999.
12	According to anarchist scholar Simon Critchley, "contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary neo-liberalism ...
12	One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility, whether sexual, ecological or socio-economic; it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest; it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality, impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally."
12	International anarchist federations in existence include the International of Anarchist Federations, the International Workers' Association, and International Libertarian Solidarity.
12	The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the Confederación General del Trabajo (CGT) and the CNT.
12	CGT membership was estimated at around 100,000 for 2003.
12	Other active syndicalist movements include in Sweden the Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden and the Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation; the CNT-AIT in France; the Union Sindicale Italiana in Italy; in the US Workers Solidarity Alliance and the UK Solidarity Federation.
12	The revolutionary industrial unionist Industrial Workers of the World, claiming 2,000 paying members, and the International Workers Association, an anarcho-syndicali, claiming 2,000 payinst successor to the First International, also remain active.
12	Anarchist schools of thought Anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions, individualist anarchism and social anarchism, which have some different origins, values and evolution.
12	The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises negative liberty, i.e.
12	"recognizing equality of entitlement".
12	In a chronological and theoretical sense, there are classical — those created throughout the 19th century — and post-classical anarchist schools — those created since the mid-20th century and after.
12	Beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is philosophical anarchism, which embodies the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it.
12	A component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a minimal state as unfortunate, and usually temporary, "necessary evil" but argue that citizens do not have a moral obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy.
12	One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was "anarchism without adjectives", a call for toleration first adopted by Fernando Tarrida del Mármol in 1889 in response to the "bitter debates" of anarchist theory at the time.
12	In abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms (i.e.
12	Classical anarchist schools of thought Mutualism Mutualism began in 18th century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in France and others in the United States.
12	Proudhon proposed spontaneous order, whereby organization emerges without central authority, a "positive anarchy" where order arises when everybody does "what he wishes and only what he wishes" and where "business transactions alone produce the social order."
12	It is important to recognize that Proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance.
12	For this reason, much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance, Proudhon was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself not with Anarchist but Socialist factions of workers movements and, in addition to advocating state-protected charters for worker-owned cooperatives, promoted certain nationalization schemes during his life of public service.
12	Mutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity, free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform.
12	According to the American mutualist William Batchelder Greene, each worker in the mutualist system would receive "just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount."
12	Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.
12	Proudhon first characterised his goal as a "third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property."
12	Individualist anarchism Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions, and ideological systems.
12	Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict.
12	In 1793, William Godwin, who has often been cited as the first anarchist, wrote Political Justice, which some consider the first expression of anarchism.
12	Godwin, a philosophical anarchist, from a rationalist and utilitarian basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a minimal state as a present "necessary evil" that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge.
12	Godwin advocated individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good.
12	An influential form of individualist anarchism, called "egoism," or egoist anarchism, was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism, the German Max Stirner.
12	Stirner's The Ego and Its Own, published in 1844, is a founding text of the philosophy.
12	According to Stirner, the only limitation on the rights of the individual is their power to obtain what they desire, without regard for God, state, or morality.
12	To Stirner, rights were spooks in the mind, and he held that society does not exist but "the individuals are its reality".
12	Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw unions of egoists, non-systematic associations continually renewed by all parties' support through an act of will, which Stirner proposed as a form of organization in place of the state.
12	Egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals.
12	"Egoism" has inspired many interpretations of Stirner's philosophy.
12	It was re-discovered and promoted by German philosophical anarchist and LGBT activist John Henry Mackay.
12	Josiah Warren is widely regarded as the first American anarchist, and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, The Peaceful Revolutionist, was the first anarchist periodical published.
12	For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster "It is apparent ...
12	Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of Josiah Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews ...
12	William B.
12	Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form.".
12	Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe.
12	Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, development critic, surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading transcendentalist.
12	He is best known for his books Walden, a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay, Civil Disobedience, an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state.
12	Later Benjamin Tucker fused Stirner's egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication Liberty.
12	From these early influences individualist anarchism in different countries attracted a small but diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals, free love and birth control advocates (see Anarchism and issues related to love and sex), individualist naturists nudists (see anarcho-naturism), freethought and anti-clearical activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation (see European individualist anarchism and individualist anarchism in France).
12	These authors and activists included Oscar Wilde, Emile Armand, Han Ryner, Henri Zisly, Renzo Novatore, Miguel Gimenez Igualada, Adolf Brand and Lev Chernyi among others.
12	Social anarchism Social anarchism calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without any government authority or coercion.
12	It is the largest school of thought in anarchism.
12	Social anarchism rejects private property, seeing it as a source of social inequality (while retaining respect for personal property), and emphasises cooperation and mutual aid.
12	Collectivist anarchism Collectivist anarchism, also referred to as "revolutionary socialism" or a form of such, is a revolutionary form of anarchism, commonly associated with Mikhail Bakunin and Johann Most.
12	Collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivised.
12	This was to be achieved through violent revolution, first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence, or propaganda by the deed, which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production.
12	However, collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income, as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed "according to need" as in anarcho-communism.
12	This position was criticised by anarchist communists as effectively "uphold[ing] the wages system".
12	Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with Marxism but opposed the Marxist dictatorship of the proletariat, despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society.
12	Anarchist, communist and collectivist ideas are not mutually exclusive; although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for las are not mutually exclusive; although the collectivibour, some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.
12	Anarcho-communism Anarchist communism (also known as anarcho-communism, libertarian communism and occasionally as free communism) is a theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the state, markets, money, private property (while retaining respect for personal property), and capitalism in favor of common ownership of the means of production, direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers' councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need".
12	Some forms of anarchist communism such as insurrectionary anarchism are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism, believing anarcho-communism is the best social system for the realization of individual freedom.
12	Most anarcho-communists view anarcho-communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society.
12	Anarcho-communism developed out of radical socialist lful Disobedcurrents after the French revolution but was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the First International.
12	The theoretical work of Peter Kropotkin took importance later as it expanded and developed pro-organizationalist and insurrectionary anti-organizationalist sections.
12	To date, the best known examples of an anarchist communist society (i.e., established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon), are the anarchist territories during the Spanish Revolution and the Free Territory during the Russian Revolution.
12	Through the efforts and influence of the Spanish Anarchists during the Spanish Revolution within the Spanish Civil War, starting in 1936 anarchist communism existed in most of Aragon, parts of the Levante and Andalusia, as well as in the stronghold of Anarchist Catalonia before being crushed by the combined forces of the regime that won the war, Hitler, Mussolini, Spanish Communist Party repression (backed by the USSR) as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the Spanish Republic itself.
12	During the Russian Revolution, anarchists such as Nestor Makhno worked to create and defend—through the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine—anarchist communism in the Free Territory of the Ukraine from 1919 before being conquered by the Bolsheviks in 1921.
12	Anarcho-syndicalism Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the labor movement.
12	Anarcho-syndicalists view labor unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers.
12	The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are: Workers' solidarity, Direct action and Workers' self-management Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only direct action—that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal, as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position—will allow workers to liberate themselves.
12	Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organizations (the organizations that struggle against the wage system, which, in anarcho-syndicalist theory, will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing.
12	They should not have bosses or "business agents"; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves.
12	Rudolf Rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement.
12	He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought, and why it was important to the future of labor in his 1938 pamphlet Anarcho-Syndicalism.The International Workers Association is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labor unions from different countries.
12	The Spanish Confederación Nacional del Trabajo played and still plays a major role in the Spanish labor movement.
12	It was also an important force in the Spanish Civil War.
12	Post-classical schools of thought Anarchism continues to generate many philosophies and movements, at times eclectic, drawing upon various sources, and syncretic, combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches.
12	Anarcha-feminism developed as a synthesis of radical feminism and anarchism that views patriarchy (male domination over women) as a fundamental manifestation of compulsory government.
12	It was inspired by the late 19th century writings of early feminist anarchists such as Lucy Parsons, Emma Goldman, and Voltairine de Cleyre.
12	Anarcha-feminists, like other radical feminists, criticize and advocate the abolition of traditional conceptions of family, education, and gender roles.
12	Green anarchism (or eco-anarchism) is a school of thought within anarchism that emphasizes environmental issues, with an important precedent in anarcho-naturism, and whose main contemporary currents are anarcho-primitivism and social ecology.
12	Anarcho-pacifism is a tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change (see non-violence).
12	It developed "mostly in the Netherlands, Britain, and the United States, before and during the Second World War".
12	Christian anarchism is a movement in political theology that combines anarchism and Christianity.
12	Its main proponents included Leo Tolstoy, Dorothy Day, Ammon Hennacy, and Jacques Ellul.
12	Platformism is a tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of Dielo Truda's Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft).
12	The document was based on the experiences of Russian anarchists in the 1917 October Revolution, which led eventually to the victory of the Bolsheviks over the anarchists and other groups.
12	The Platform attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement's failures during the Russian Revolution.
12	Synthesis anarchism is a form of anarchist organization that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives.
12	In the 1920s, this form found as its main proponents the anarcho-communists Voline and Sébastien Faure.
12	It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global International of Anarchist Federations.
12	Post-left anarchy is a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchism's relationship to traditional Left-wing politics.
12	Some post-leftists seek to escape the confines of ideology in general also presenting a critique of organizations and morality.
12	Influenced by the work of Max Stirner and by the Marxist Situationist International, post-left anarchy is marked by a focus on social insurrection and a rejection of leftist social organisation.
12	Insurrectionary anarchism is a revolutionary theory, practice, and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasizes insurrection within anarchist practice.
12	It is critical of formal organizations such as labor unions and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses.
12	Instead, insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization and small affinity group based organization.
12	Insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack, permanent class conflict, and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies.
12	Post-anarchism is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought, drawing from diverse ideas including post-modernism, autonomist marxism, post-left anarchy, situationism, and postcolonialism.
12	Anarcho-capitalism advocates the elimination of the state in favor of individual sovereignty in a free market.
12	Anarcho-capitalism developed from radical anti-state libertarianism and individualist anarchism, drawing from Austrian School economics, study of law and economics, and public choice theory.
12	There is a strong current within anarchism which does not coam, UK: Edwardnsider that anarcho-capitalism can be considered a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an anti-capitalist movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism incompatible with capitalist forms.
12	Internal issues and debates Anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought; as such, disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common.
12	The compatibility of capitalism, nationalism, and religion with anarchism is widely disputed.
12	Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as Marxism, communism and capitalism.
12	Anarchists may be motivated by humanism, divine authority, enlightened self-interest, veganism or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.
12	Phenomena such as civilization, technology (e.g.
12	On a tactical level, while propaganda of the deed was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g.
12	Nihilist movement), some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative direct action methods such as nonviolence, counter-economics and anti-state cryptography to bring about an anarchist society.
12	About the scope of an anarchist society, some anarchists advocate a global one, while others do so by local ones.
12	The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has led to many definitional concerns in anarchist theory.
12	Topics of interest Intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought, certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory.
12	Free love An important current within anarchism is free love.
12	Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to Josiah Warren and to experimental communities, viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of an individual's self-ownership.
12	Free love particularly stressed women's rights since most sexual laws discriminated against women: for example, marriage laws and anti-birth control measures.
12	The most important American free love journal was Lucifer the Lightbearer (1883–1907) edited by Moses Harman and Lois Waisbrooker, but also there existed Ezra Heywood and Angela Heywood's The Word (1872–1890, 1892–1893).
12	Free Society (1895–1897 as The Firebrand; 1897–1904 as Free Society) was a major anarchist newspaper in the United States at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries.
12	The publication advocated free love and women's rights, and critiqued "Comstockery"—censorship of sexual information.
12	Also M.
12	E.
12	Lazarus was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love.
12	In New York City's Greenwich Village, bohemian feminists and socialists advocated self-realisation and pleasure for women (and also men) in the here and now.
12	They encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality, and the openly bisexual radical Edna St.
12	Vincent Millay and the lesbian anarchist Margaret Anderson were prominent among them.
12	Discussion groups organised by the Villagers were frequented by Emma Goldman, among others.
12	Magnus Hirschfeld noted in 1923 that Goldman "has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights, and especially for those deprived of their rights.
12	Thus it came about that she was the first and only woman, indeed the first and only American, to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public."
12	In fact, before Goldman, heterosexual anarchist Robert Reitzel (1849–1898) spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the 1890s in his Detroit-based German language journal Der arme Teufel.
12	In Argentina anarcha-feminist Virginia Bolten published t language journal Der arme Tehe newspaper called ' (), which was published nine times in Rosario between 8 January 1896 and 1 January 1897, and was revived, briefly, in 1901.
12	In Europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was Emile Armand.
12	He proposed the concept of la camaraderie amoureuse to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults.
12	He was also a consistent proponent of polyamory.
12	In Germany the stirnerists Adolf Brand and John Henry Mackay were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality.
12	More recently, the British anarcho-pacifist Alex Comfort gained notoriety during the sexual revolution for writing the bestseller sex manual The Joy of Sex.
12	The issue of free love has a dedicated treatment in the work of French anarcho-hedonist philosopher Michel Onfray in such works as Théorie du corps amoureux : pour une érotique solaire (2000) and L'invention du plaisir : fragments cyréaniques (2002).
12	Libertarian education and freethought  For English anarchist William Godwin education was "the main means by which change would be achieved."
12	Godwin saw that the main goal of education should be the promotion of happiness.
12	For Godwin education had to have "A respect for the child's autonomy which precluded any form of coercion," "A pedagogy that respected this and sought to build on the child's own motivation and initiatives," and "A concern about the child's capacity to resist an ideology transmitted through the school."
12	In his Political Justice he criticizes state sponsored schooling "on account of its obvious alliance with national government".
12	Early American anarchist Josiah Warren advanced alternative education experiences in the libertarian communities he established.
12	Max Stirner wrote in 1842 a long essay on education called The False Principle of our Education.
12	In it Stirner names his educational principle "personalist," explaining that self-understanding consists in hourly self-creation.
12	Education for him is to create "free men, sovereign characters," by which he means "eternal characters ...
12	".
12	In the United States "freethought was a basically anti-christian, anti-clerical movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters.
12	A number of contributors to Liberty (anarchist publication) were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism.
12	The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of Freethought and, for a time, The Truth Seeker.
12	E.C.
12	Walker was co-editor of the excellent free-thought / free love journal Lucifer, the Light-Bearer".
12	"Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as Lucifer, the Light-Bearer, Freethought and The Truth Seeker appeared in Liberty... The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself".
12	In 1901, Catalan anarchist and free-thinker Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia established "modern" or progressive schools in Barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church.
12	The schools' stated goal was to "educate the working class in a rational, secular and non-coercive setting".
12	Fiercely anti-clerical, Ferrer believed in "freedom in education", education free from the authority of church and state.
12	Murray Bookchin wrote: "This period [1890s] was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where Anarchists exercised some degree of influence.
12	Perhaps the best-known effort in this field was Francisco Ferrer's Modern School (Escuela Moderna), a project which exercised a considerable influence on Catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally."
12	La Escuela Moderna, and Ferrer's ideas generally, formed the inspiration for a series of Modern Schools in the United States, Cuba, South America and London.
12	The first of these was started in New York City in 1911.
12	It also inspired the Italian newspaper Università popolare, founded in 1901.
12	Russian christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy established a school for peasant children on his estate.
12	Tolstoy's educational experiments were short-lived due to harassment by the Tsarist secret police.
12	Tolstoy established a conceptual difference between education and culture.
12	He thought that "Education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself ...
12	Education is culture under restraint, culture is free.
12	Education is] when the teaching is forced upon the pupil, and when then instruction is exclusive, that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary".
12	For him "without compulsion, education was transformed into culture".
12	A more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of unschooling and the free school in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches.
12	Experiments in Germany led to A.
12	S.
12	Neill founding what became Summerhill School in 1921.
12	Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice.
12	However, although Summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian, they differ in principle from those of Ferrer by not advocating an overtly political class struggle-approach.
12	In addition to organizing schools according to libertarian principles, anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se.
12	The term deschooling was popularized by Ivan Illich, who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead.
12	Criticisms  Criticisms of anarchism include moral criticisms and pragmatic criticisms.
25	Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name.
25	Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms; for example, they have less eye contact and turn taking, and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as the deficiency to point at things.
25	Three- to five-year-old autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others.
25	However, they do form attachments to their primary caregivers.
25	Most autistic children display moderately less attachment security than non-autistic children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD.
25	Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition.
25	For further information on facial recognition and processing in individuals with ASD, see the autism and facial recognition section of face perception.
25	Children with high-functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone.
25	Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism.
25	For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel.
25	Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect the quality of life more deeply.
25	There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD.
25	The limited data suggest that, in children with mental retardation, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and tantrums.
25	A 2007 study interviewed parents of 67 children with ASD and reported that about two-thirds of the children had periods of severe tantrums and about one-third had a history of aggression, with tantrums significantly more common than in non-autistic children with language impairments.
25	A 2008 Swedish study found that, of individuals aged 15 or older discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of ASD, those who committed violent crimes were significantly more likely to have other psychopathological conditions such as psychosis.
25	Communication About a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs.
25	Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of babbling, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver.
25	In the second and third years, autistic children have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words.
25	Autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others' words (echolalia) or reverse pronouns.
25	Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD: for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience.
25	Autistic children may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.
25	In a pair of studies, high-functioning autistic children aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling.
25	Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference.
25	As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.
25	Repetitive behavior Autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) categorizes as follows.
25	Stereotypy is repetitive movement, such as hand flapping, head rolling, or body rocking.
25	Compulsive behavior is intended and appears to follow rules, such as arranging objects in stacks or lines.
25	Sameness is resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted.
25	Ritualistic behavior involves an unvarying pattern of daily activities, such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual.
25	This is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors.
25	Restricted behavior is limited in focus, interest, or activity, such as preoccupation with a single television program, toy, or game.
25	Self-injury includes movements that injure or can injure the person, such as eye poking, skin picking, hand biting, and head banging.
25	A 2007 study reported that self-injury at some point affected about 30% of children with ASD.
25	No single repetitive or self-injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism, but only autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.
25	Other sympts FJ, Parker DE, Lewis MH |doi oms Autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but that can affect the individual or the family.
25	An estimated 0.5% to 10% of individuals with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants.
25	Many individuals with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention, relative to the general population.
25	Sensory abnormalities are found in over 90% of those with autism, and are considered core features by some, although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders.
25	Differences are greater for under-responsivity (for example, walking into things) than for over-responsivity (for example, distress from loud noises) or for sensation seeking (for example, rhythmic movements).
25	An estimated 60%–80% of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone, poor motor planning, and toe walking; deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper.
25	Unusual eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with ASD, to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator.
25	Selectivity is the most common problem, although eating rituals and food refusal also occur; this does not appear to result in malnutrition.
25	Although some children with autism also have gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that autistic children have more or different GI symptoms than usual; studies report conflicting results, and the relationship between GI problems and ASD is unclear.
25	Parents of children with ASD have higher levels of stress.
25	Siblings of children with ASD report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with Down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship.
25	However, they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with Down syndrome; siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults.
25	Classification Autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior.
25	These symptoms do not imply sickness, fragility, or emotional disturbance.
25	Of the five PDD forms, Asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; PDD not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS; also called atypical autism) is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder.
25	Unlike with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development.
25	The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS often called the autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or sometimes the autistic disorders, whereas autism itself is often called autistic disorder, childhood autism, or infantile autism.
25	In this article, autism refers to the classic autistic disorder; in clinical practice, though, autism, ASD, and PDD are often used interchangeably.
25	ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism phenotype, which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like traits, such as avoiding eye contact.
25	The manifestations of autism cover a wide spectrum, ranging from individuals with severe impairments—who may be silent, mentally disabled, and locked into hand flapping and rocking—to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, pedantic communication.
25	Because the behavior spectrum is continuous, boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary.
25	Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low-, medium- or high-functioning autism (LFA, MFA, and HFA), based on IQ thresholds, or on how much support the individual requires in daily life; these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial.
25	Autism can also be divided into syndromal and non-syndromal autism; the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound mental retardation or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms, such as tuberous sclerosis.
25	Although individuals with Asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism, the extent of the overlap between Asperger syndrome, HFA, and non-syndromal autism is unclear.
25	Some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills, as opposed to a failure to make progress, typically from 15 to 30 months of age.
25	The validity of this distinction remains controversial; it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype, or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression.
25	Research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry, psychology, neurology and pediatrics.
25	Newer technologies such as fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes (observable traits) that can be viewed on brain scans, to help further neurogenetic studies of autism; one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain, which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects.
25	It has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior.
25	Causes It has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic, cognitive, and neural levels for autism's characteristic triad of symptoms.
25	However, there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a coms.
25	However, therplex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co-occur.
25	Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare mutations with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants.
25	Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and epigenetic factors which do not change DNA but are heritable and influence gene expression.
25	Studies of twins suggest that heritability is 0.7 for autism and as high as 0.9 for ASD, and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be autistic than the general population.
25	However, most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified.
25	Typically, autism cannot be traced to a Mendelian (single-gene) mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality, and none of the genetic syndromes associated with ASDs have been shown to selectively cause ASD.
25	Numerous candidate genes have been located, with only small effects attributable to any particular gene.
25	The large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from copy number variations—spontaneous deletions or duplications in genetic material during meiosis.
25	Hence, a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited: that is, the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome.
25	Several lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as a cause of autism.
25	Some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways, such as those involved with cell adhesion.
25	Gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity-dependent changes.
25	All known teratogens (agents that cause birth defects) related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception, and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development.
25	Although evidence for other environmental causes is anecdotal and has not been confirmed by reliable studies, extensive searches are underway.
25	Environmental factors that have been claimed to contribute to or exacerbate autism, or may be important in future research, include certain foods, infectious disease, heavy metals, solvents, diesel exhaust, PCBs, phthalates and phenols used in plastic products, pesticides, brominated flame retardants, alcohol, smoking, illicit drugs, vaccines, and prenatal stress, although no links have been found, and some have been completely disproven.
25	Parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination.
25	This has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine "overload", a vaccine preservative, or the MMR vaccine for causing autism.
25	The latter theory was supported by a litigation-funded study that has since been shown to have been "an elaborate fraud".
25	Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible, parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations, outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries, and the preventable deaths of several children.
25	Mechanism Autism's symptoms result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain.
25	How autism occurs is not well understood.
25	Its mechanism can be divided into two areas: the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism, and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors.
25	The behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies.
25	Pathophysiology Unlike many other brain disorders, such as Parkinson's, autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular, cellular, or systems level; it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways, or is (like intellectual disability) a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms.
25	Autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems, and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product.
25	Neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that autism's mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception.
25	This anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors.
25	Just after birth, the brains of autistic children tend to grow faster than usual, followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood.
25	It is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all autistic children.
25	It seems to be most prominent in brain areas underlying the development of higher cognitive specialization.
25	Hypotheses for the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth include the following: * An excess of neurons that causes local overconnectivity in key brain regions.
25	Disturbed neuronal migration during early gestation.
25	Unbalanced excitatory–inhibitory networks.
25	Abnormal formation of synapses and dendritic spines, for example, by modulation of the neurexin–neuroligin cell-adhesion system, or by poorly regulated synthesis of synaptic proteins.
25	Disrupted synaptic development may also contribute to epilepsy, which may explain why the two conditions are associated.
25	Interactions between the immune system and the nervous system begin early during the embryonic stage of life, and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response.
25	Aberrant immune activity during critical periods of neurodevelopment is possibly part of the mechanism of some forms of ASD.
25	Although some abnormalities in the immune system have been found in specific subgroups of autistic individuals, it is not known whether these abnormalities are relevant to or secondary to autism's disease processes.
25	As autoantibodies are foutitle=Autism and immune factors: a comprehensive revnd in conditions other than ASD, and are not always present in ASD, the relationship between immune disturbances and autism remains unclear and controversial.
25	The relationship of neurochemicals to autism is not well understood; several have been investigated, with the most evidence for the role of serotonin and of genetic differences in its transport.
25	The role of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) in the pathogenesis of fragile X syndrome, the most common identified genetic cause of autism, has led to interest in the possible implications for future autism research into this pathway.
25	Some data suggest an increase in several growth hormones; other data argue for diminished growth factors.
25	Also, some inborn errors of metabolism are associated with autism, but probably account for less than 5% of cases.
25	The mirror neuron system (MNS) theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the MNS interferes with imitation and leads to autism's core features of social impairment and communication difficulties.
25	The MNS operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action.
25	The MNS may contribute to an individual's understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions, intentions, and emotions.
25	Several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in MNS regions of individuals with ASD, delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with Asperger syndrome, and a correlation between reduced MNS activity and severity of the syndrome in children with ASD.
25	However, individuals with autism also have abnormal brain activation in many circuits outside the MNS and the MNS theory does not explain the normal performance of autistic children on imitation tasks that involve a goal or object.
25	ASD-related patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks.
25	In autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the default network, a large-scale brain network involved in social and emotional processing, with intact connectivity of the task-positive network, used in sustained attention and goal-directed thinking.
25	In people with autism the two networks are not negatively correlated in time, suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks, possibly reflecting a disturbance of self-referential thought.
25	A 2008 brain-imaging study found a specific pattern of signals in the cingulate cortex which differs in individuals with ASD.
25	The underconnectivity theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by underfunctioning high-level neural connections and synchronization, along with an excess of low-level processes.
25	Evidence for this theory has been found in functional neuroimaging studies on autistic individuals and by a brainwave study that suggested that adults with ASD have local overconnectivity in the cortex and weak functional connections between the frontal lobe and the rest of the cortex.
25	Other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each hemisphere of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the association cortex.
25	From studies based on event-related potentials, transient changes to the brain's electrical activity in response to stimuli, there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention, orientiation to auditory and visual stimuli, novelty detection, language and face processing, and information storage; several studies have found a preference for nonsocial stimuli.
25	For example, magnetoencephalography studies have found evidence in autistic children of delayed responses in the brain's processing of auditory signals.
25	In the genetic area, relations have been found between autism and schizophrenia based on duplications and deletions of chromosomes; research showed that schizophrenia and autism are significantly more common in combination with 1q21.1 deletion syndrome.
25	Research on autism/schizophrenia relations for chromosome 15 (15q13.3), chromosome 16 (16p13.1) and chromosome 17 (17p12) are inconclusive.
25	Neuropsychology Two major categories of cognitive theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior.
25	The first category focuses on deficits in social cognition.
25	The empathizing–systemizing theory postulates that autistic individuals can systemize—that is, they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain—but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents.
25	An extension, the extreme male brain theory, hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain, defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing; this extension is controversial, as many studies contradict the idea that baby boys and girls respond differently to people and objects.
25	These theories are somewhat related to the earlier theory of mind approach, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others.
25	The theory of mind hypothesis is supported by autistic children's atypical responses to the Sally–Anne test for reasoning about others' motivations, and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in Pathophysiology maps well to the hypothesis.
25	However, most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic intentions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints.
25	The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing: the executive functions such as working memory, planning, inhibition.
25	In his review, Kenworthy states that "the claim of executive dysfunction as a causal factor in autism is controversial", however, "it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism".
25	Tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence, but performance never reaches typical adult levels.
25	A strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests; two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure and that executive function deficits have not been found in young autistic children.
25	Weak central coherence theory hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism.
25	One strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people.
25	A related theory—enhanced perceptual functioning—focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and perceptual operations in autistic individuals.
25	These theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism.
25	Neither category is satisfactory on its own; social cognition theories poorly address autism's rigid and repetitive behaviors, while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties.
25	A combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful.
25	Screening About half of parents of children with ASD notice their child's unusual behaviors by age 18 months, and about four-fifths notice by age 24 months.
25	According to an article in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, failure to meet any of the following milestones "is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations.
25	Delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long-term outcome".
25	No babbling by 12 months.
25	No gesturing (pointing, waving, etc.) by 12 months.
25	No single words by 16 months.
25	No two-word (spontaneous, not just echolalic) phrases by 24 months.
25	Any loss of any language or social skills, at any age.
25	US and Japanese practice is to screen all children for ASD at 18 and 24 months, using autism-specific formal screening tests.
25	In contrast, in the UK, children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened.
25	It is not known which approach is more effective.
25	Screening tools include the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), the Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire, and the First Year Inventory; initial data on M-CHAT and its predecessor CHAT on children aged 18–30 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity (many false-negatives) but good specificity (few false-positives).
25	It may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish ASD from other developmental disorders.
25	Screening tools designed for one culture's norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture.
25	Although genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical, it can be considered in some cases, such as children with neurological symptoms and dysmorphic features.
25	Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on behavior, not cause or mechanism.
25	Autism is defined in the DSM-IV-TR as exhibiting at least six symptoms total, including at least two symptoms of qualitative impairment in social interaction, at least one symptom of qualitative impairment in communication, and at least one symptom of restricted and repetitive behavior.
25	Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity, stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language, and persistent preoccupation with parts of objects.
25	Onset must be prior to age three years, with delays or abnormal functioning in either social interaction, language as used in social communication, or symbolic or imaginative play.
25	The disturbance must not be better accounted for by Rett syndrome or childhood disintegrative disorder.
25	ICD-10 uses essentially the same definition.
25	Several diagnostic instruments are available.
25	Two are commonly used in autism research: the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) is a semistructured parent interview, and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) uses observation and interaction with the child.
25	The Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children.
25	A pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child.
25	If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated medical conditions.
25	A pediatric neuropsychologist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills, both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions.
25	A differential diagnosis for ASD at tmid18855144 |doi 10.1007/s11065-008-907his stage might also consider mental retardation, hearing impairment, and a specific language impairment such as Landau–Kleffner syndrome.
25	The presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as depression.
25	Clinical genetics evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed, particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause.
25	Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40% of cases to genetic causes, consensus guidelines in the US and UK are limited to high-resolution chromosome and fragile X testing.
25	A genotype-first model of diagnosis has been proposed, which would routinely assess the genome's copy number variations.
25	As new genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge.
25	Commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results, given the complexity of autism's genetics.
25	Metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful, but are not routine.
25	ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months, although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life: for example, a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later.
25	In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice.
25	A 2009 US study found the average age of formal ASD diagnosis was 5.7 years, far above recommendations, and that 27% of children remained undiagnosed at age 8 years.
25	Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood, they are sometimes missed; years later, adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits.
25	Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices.
25	The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms.
25	Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis.
25	It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired, partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or blindisms.
25	Management The main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress, and to increase quality of life and functional independence.
25	No single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child's needs.
25	Families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment.
25	Studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy.
25	Although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence, suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment, the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor, their clinical results are mostly tentative, and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options.
25	Intensive, sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self-care, social, and job skills, and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors; claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated.
25	Available approaches include applied behavior analysis (ABA), developmental models, structured teaching, speech and language therapy, social skills therapy, and occupational therapy.
25	Educational interventions can be effective to varying degrees in most children: intensive ABA treatment has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children and is well-established for improving intellectual performance of young children.
25	Neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators, resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided.
25	It is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up, and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results.
25	The appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers.
25	Many medications are used to treat ASD symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails.
25	More than half of US children diagnosed with ASD are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants, with the most common drug classes being antidepressants, stimulants, and antipsychotics.
25	Aside from antipsychotics, there is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD.
25	A person with ASD may respond atypically to medications, the medications can have adverse effects, and no known medication relieves autism's core symptoms of social and communication impairments.
25	Experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function, suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism.
25	Although many alternative therapies and interventions are available, few are supported by scientific studies.
25	Treatment approaches have little empirical support in quality-of-life contexts, and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real-world relevance.
25	Scientific evidence appears to matter less to service providers than program marketing, training availability, and parent requests.
25	Some alternative treatments may place the child at risk.
25	A 2008 study found that compared to their peers, autistic boys have significantly thinner bones if on casein-free diets; in 2005, botched chelation therapy killed a five-year-old child with autism.
25	Treatment is expensive; indirect costs are more so.
25	For someone born in 2000, a US study estimated an average lifetime cost of $ (net present value in  dollars, inflation-adjusted from 2003 estimate), with about 10% medical care, 30% extra education and other care, and 60% lost economic productivity.
25	Publicly supported programs are often inadequate or inappropriate for a given child, and unreimbursed out-of-pocket medical or therapy expenses are associated with likelihood of family financial problems; one 2008 US study found a 14% average loss of annual income in families of children with ASD, and a related study found that ASD is associated with higher probability that child care problems will greatly affect parental employment.
25	US states increasingly require private health insurance to cover autism services, shifting costs from publicly funded education programs to privately funded health insurance.
25	After childhood, key treatment issues include residential care, job training and placement, sexuality, social skills, and estate planning.
25	Prognosis There is no known cure.
25	Children recover occasionally, so that they lose their diagnosis of ASD; this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not.
25	It is not known how often recovery happens; reported rates in unselected samples of children with ASD have ranged from 3% to 25%.
25	Most autistic children can acquire language by age 5 or younger, though a few have developed communication skills in later years.
25	Most children with autism lack social support, meaningful relationships, future employment opportunities or self-determination.
25	Although core difficulties tend to persist, symptoms often become less severe with age.
25	Few high-quality studies address long-term prognosis.
25	Some adults show modest improvement in communication skills, but a few decline; no study has focused on autism after midlife.
25	Acquiring language before age six, having an IQ above 50, and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes; independent living is unlikely with severe autism.
25	A 2004 British study of 68 adults who were diagnosed before 1980 as autistic children with IQ above 50 found that 12% achieved a high level of independence as adults, 10% had some friends and were generally in work but required some support, 19% had some independence but were generally living at home and needed considerable support and supervision in daily living, 46% needed specialist residential provision from facilities specializing in ASD with a high level of support and very limited autonomy, and 12% needed high-level hospital care.
25	A 2005 Swedish study of 78 adults that did not exclude low IQ found worse prognosis; for example, only 4% achieved independence.
25	A 2008 Canadian study of 48 young adults diagnosed with ASD as preschoolers found outcomes ranging through poor (46%), fair (32%), good (17%), and very good (4%); 56% of these young adults had been employed at some point during their lives, mostly in volunteer, sheltered or part-time work.
25	Changes in diagnostic practice and increased availability of effective early intervention make it unclear whether these findings can be generalized to recently diagnosed children.
25	Epidemiology Most recent reviews tend to estimate a prevalence of 1–2 per 1,000 for autism and close to 6 per 1,000 for ASD, and 11 per 1,000 children in the United States for ASD as of 2008; because of inadequate data, these numbers may underestimate ASD's true prevalence.
25	PDD-NOS's prevalence has been estimated at 3.7 per 1,000, Asperger syndrome at roughly 0.6 per 1,000, and childhood disintegrative disorder at 0.02 per 1,000.
25	The number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s.
25	This increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices, referral patterns, availability of services, age at diagnosis, and public awareness, though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out.
25	The available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism's true prevalence has increased; a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics.
25	Boys are at higher risk for ASD than girls.
25	The sex ratio averages 4.3:1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment: it may be close to 2:1 with mental retardation and more than 5.5:1 without.
25	Although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy-related risk factor as a cause of autism, the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent, and with diabetes, bleeding, and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy.
25	The risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers; two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm, and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism.
25	Most professionals believe that race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism.
25	Several other conditions are common in children with autism.
25	They include: * Genetic disorders.
25	About 10–15% of autism cases have an identifiable Mendelian (single-gene) condition, chromosome abnormality, or other genetic syndrome, and ASD is associated with several genetic disorders.
25	Mental retardation.
25	The percentage of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for mental retardation has been reported as anywhere from 25% to 70%, a wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing autistic intelligence.
25	In comparison, for PDD-NOS the association with mental retardation is much weaker,  and by definition, the diagnosis of Asperger's excludes mental retardation.
25	Anxiety disorders are common among children with ASD; there are no firm data, but studies have reported prevalences ranging from 11% to 84%.
25	Many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by ASD itself, or are hard to distinguish from ASD's symptoms.
25	Epilepsy, with variations in risk of epilepsy due to age, cognitive level, and type of language disorder.
25	Several metabolic defects, such as phenylketonuria, are associated with autistic symptoms.
25	Minor physical anomalies are significantly increased in the autistic population.
25	Preempted diagnoses.
25	Although the DSM-IV rules out concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism, the full criteria for  Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Tourette syndrome, and other of these conditions are often present and these comorbid diagnoses are increasingly accepted.
25	Sleep problems affect about two-thirds of individuals with ASD at some point in childhood.
25	These most commonly include symptoms of insomnia such as difficulty in falling asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings, and early morning awakenings.
25	Sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress, and are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary ASD diagnosis.
25	History A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named.
25	The Table Talk of Martin Luther, compiled by his notetaker, Mathesius, contains the story of a 12-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic.
25	Luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil, and suggested that he be suffocated, although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report.
25	The earliest well-documented case of autism is that of Hugh Blair of Borgue, as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul Blair's marriage to gain Blair's inheritance.
25	The Wild Boy of Aveyron, a feral child caught in 1798, showed several signs of autism; the medical student Jean Itard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation.
25	The New Latin word autismus (English translation autism) was coined by the Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia.
25	He derived it from the Greek word autós (αὐτός, meaning self), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to "autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance".
25	The word autism first took its modern sense in 1938 when Hans Asperger of the Vienna University Hospital adopted Bleuler's terminology autistic psychopaths in a lecture in German about child psychology.
25	Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as Asperger syndrome, though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981.
25	Leo Kanner of the Johns Hopkins Hospital first used autism in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label early infantile autism in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities.
25	Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably "autistic aloneness" and "insistence on sameness", are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.
25	It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger.
25	Kanner's reuse of autism led to decades of confused terminology like infantile schizophrenia, and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to "refrigerator mothers".
25	Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome by demonstrating that it is lifelong, distinguishing it from mental retardation and schizophrenia and from other developmental disorders, and demonstrating the benefits of involving parents in active programs of therapy.
25	As late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism; now it is thought to be one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions.
25	Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have deeply affected how we view ASD, parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their autistic children's behaviors are perceived negatively by others, and many primary care physicians and medical specialists still express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research.
25	The Internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely.
25	Sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that autism is simply another way of being.
39	Albedo, or reflection coefficient, derived from Latin albedo "whiteness" (or reflected sunlight), in turn from albus "white", is the diffuse reflectivity or reflecting power of a surface.
39	It is defined as the ratio of reflected radiation from the surface to incident radiation upon it.
39	Being a [efined as the rati[Dimensionless number|dimensionless fraction, it may also be expressed as a percentage, and is measured on a scale from zero for no reflecting power of a perfectly black surface, to 1 for perfect reflection of a white surface.
39	Albedo depends on the frequency of the radiation.
39	When quoted unqualified, it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of visible light.
39	In general, the albedo depends on the directional distribution of incoming radiation.
39	Exceptions are Lambertian surfaces, which scatter radiation in all directions according to a cosine function, so their albedo does not depend on the incident distribution.
39	In practice, a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) may be required to characterize the scattering properties of a surface accurately, although the albedo is a very useful first approximation.
39	The albedo is an important concept in climatology and astronomy, as well as in calculating reflectivity of surfaces in LEED sustainable rating systems for buildings.
39	The average overall albedo of Earth, its planetary albedo, is 30 to 35%, because of the covering by clouds, but varies widely locally across the surface, depending on the geological and environmental features.
39	The term was introduced into optics by Johann Heinrich Lambert in his 1760 work Photometria.
39	Terrestrial albedo Albedos of typical materials in visible light range from up to 0.9 for fresh snow, to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances.
39	Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body.
39	When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms.
39	Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4.
39	The average albedo of the Earth is about 0.3.
39	This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.
39	Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe.
39	However, quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult.
39	The classic example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature feedback.
39	If a snow-covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase.
39	The converse is also true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens.
39	The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of insolation; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.
39	The Earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via Earth observation satellite sensors such as NASA's MODIS instruments on board the Terra and Aqua satellites.
39	As the total amount of reflected radiation cannot be directly measured by satellite, a mathematical model of the BRDF is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional-hemispherical reflectance and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g.).
39	The Earth's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about 15 °C.
39	If the Earth was frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective) the average temperature of the planet would drop below −40 °C If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0 °C.
39	In contrast, if all the ice on Earth were to melt—a so-called aquaplanet—the average temperature on the planet would rise to just under 27 °C.
39	White-sky and black-sky albedo It has been shown that for many applications involving terrestrial albedo, the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle  can reasonably be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms: the directional-hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle, , and the bi-hemispherical reflectance,  the proportion concerned being defined as the proportion of diffuse illumination .
39	Albedo  can then be given as: Directional-hemispherical reflectance is sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo and bi-hemispherical reflectance as white-sky albedo.
39	These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.
39	Astronomical albedo The albedos of planets, satellites and asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties.
39	The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle ("phase angle"), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of photometry.
39	For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos.
39	For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content o the study of their albedos.
39	Ff outer solar system objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties, while unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metallic content in asteroids.
39	Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar system, with 99% of EM radiation reflected.
39	Another notable high-albedo body is Eris, with an albedo of 0.96 .
39	Many small objects in the outer solar system and asteroid belt have low albedos down to about 0.05.
39	A typical comet nucleus has an albedo of 0.04.
39	Such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compounds.
39	The overall albedo of the Moon is around 0.12, but it is strongly directional and non-Lambertian, displaying also a strong opposition effect.
39	While such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains, they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless solar system bodies.
39	Two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the (V-band) geometric albedo (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the Bond albedo (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected).
39	Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.
39	In detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five Hapke parameters which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle, including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces.
39	The correlation between astronomical (geometric) albedo, absolute magnitude and diameter is: , where  is the astronomical albedo,  is the diameter in kilometers, and H is the absolute magnitude.
39	Examples of terrestrial albedo effects Illumination Although the albedo–temperature effect is best known in colder, whiter regions on Earth, the maximum albedo is actually found in the tropics where year-round illumination is greater.
39	The maximum is additionally in the northern hemisphere, varying between 3 and 12 degrees north.
39	The minima are found in the subtropical regions of the northern and southern hemispheres, beyond which albedo increases without respect to illumination.
39	Small-scale effects Albedo works on a smaller scale, too.
39	In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.
39	Trees Because forests are generally attributed a low albedo, (as the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis), it has been erroneously assumed that removing forests would lead to cooling on the grounds of increased albedo.
39	Through the evapotranspiration of water, trees discharge excess heat from the forest canopy.
39	This water vapour rises resulting in cloud cover which also has a high albedo, thereby further increasing the net global cooling effect attributable to forests.
39	In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily.
39	Deciduous trees have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas coniferous trees have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.
39	Studies by the Hadley Centre have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests.
39	They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g.
39	Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.
39	Snow Snow albedos can be as high as 0.9; this, however, is for the ideal example: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape.
39	Over Antarctica they average a little more than 0.8.
39	If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo positive feedback).
39	Cryoconite, powdery windblown dust containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.
39	Water Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials.
39	The reflectiv Water ity of a water surface is calculated using the Fresnel equations (see graph).
39	At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner (not diffusely).
39	The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this.
39	At small angles of incident light, waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.
39	Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it increases tremendously at high angles of incident light such as occur on the illuminated side of the Earth near the terminator (early morning, late afternoon and near the poles).
39	However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction.
39	Since the light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.
39	Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities.
39	Fresh ‘black’ ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.
39	Clouds Cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures.
39	Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8.
39	"On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water.
39	Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth."
39	Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic.
39	A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10 °C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies.
39	Aerosol effects Aerosols (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on the Earth’s radiative balance.
39	The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties) is less certain.
39	As per  the effects are: * Aerosol direct effect.
39	Aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation.
39	The scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling, whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming.
39	Aerosol indirect effect.
39	Aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called cloud condensation nuclei.
39	Increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations, which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo, increased light scattering and radiative cooling (first indirect effect), but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud (second indirect effect).
39	Black carbon Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles.
39	The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m−2, with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m−2.
39	Other types of albedo Single-scattering albedo is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles.
39	It depends on properties of the material (refractive index); the size of the particle or particles; and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.
290	A (named a, plural aes) is the first letter and vowel in the ISO basic Latin alphabet.
290	It is similar to the Ancient Greek letter alpha, from which it derives.
290	Origins The earliest certain ancestor of "A" is aleph (also called 'aleph), the first letter of the Phoenician alphabet (which, by consisting entirely of consonants, is an abjad rather than a true alphabet).
290	In turn, the origin of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in Egyptian hieroglyphs, styled as a triangular head with 2 horns extended.
290	In 1600 B.C.E., the Phoenician alphabet's letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms.
290	Its name must have corresponded closely to the Hebrew or Arabic aleph.
290	When the ancient Greeks adopted the alphabet, they had no use for the glottal stop—the first phoneme of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter, and the sound that the letter denoted in Phoenician and other Semitic languages—so they used an adaptation of the sign to represent the vowel, and gave it the similar name of alpha.
290	In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the Greek Dark Ages, dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the Greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.
290	The Etruscans brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the Italian Peninsula and left the letter unchanged.
290	The Romans later adopted the Etruscan alphabet to write the Latin language, and the resulting letter waOld Italic alps preserved in the Latin alphabet used to write many languages, including English.
290	During Roman times there were many variations on the letter "A".
290	First, was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other "permanent" mediums.
290	For perishable surfaces, what was used for everyday or utilitarian purposes, a cursive style was used.
290	Due to the "perishable" nature of the surfaces, these examples are not as prevalent as the monumental.
290	This perishable style was called cursive and numerous variations have survived, such as majuscule cursive, miniscule cursive, semicursive miniscule.
290	There were also variants that were intermediate between the monumental and the cursive.
290	The known variants include the early semiuncial, the uncial, and the later semiuncial.
290	At the termination of the Roman Empire (5th century AD), several variants of the cursive miniscule appeared through Western Europe.
290	Among these were the semicursive miniscule of Italy, the Merovingian script in France, the Visigothic script in Spain, and the Insular or Anglo-Irish semiuncial or Anglo-Saxon majuscule, of Great Britain.
290	By the 9th century, the Caroline script, which was very similar to the present day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press.
290	This form was derived through a combining of prior forms.
290	Italy saw the formation of the two variants that we know today.
290	These variants, the Italics and Roman forms were derived from the Caroline Script version.
290	The Italics form used in most current handwriting consists of a circle and vertical stroke (), called Latin alpha or "script a".
290	This slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter tau in the hands of dark-age Irish and English writers.
290	Most printed material uses the Roman form consisting of a small loop with an arc over it ().
290	Both derive from the majuscule (capital) form.
290	In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the Uncial version shown.
290	Many fonts then made the right leg vertical.
290	In some of these, the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form.
290	Use in English In English, the letter A currently represents six different vowel sounds: A by itself frequently denotes the near-open front unrounded vowel as in pad; the open back unrounded vowel ; a closer, further fronted sound as in "hare", which developed as the sound progressed from "father" to "ace"; in concert with a later orthographic vowel, the diphthong as in ace and major, due to effects of the great vowel shift; the more rounded form in "water" or its closely related cousin, found in "was".
290	The double "a" sequence is not a native English combination; however it is used this way in some foreign words such as Aaron and aardvark.
290	"A" is the third-most-commonly used letter in English (after "E" and "T"), and the second most common in Spanish and French.
290	In one study, on average, about 3.68% of letters used in English tend to be 'a', while the number is 6.22% in Spanish and 3.95% in French.
290	"A" is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status: A-, A or A+, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students' schoolwork; "A grade" for clean restaurants; A-List celebrities, etc.
290	Such associations can have a motivating effect, as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance, when compared with other letters.
290	The letter "A" along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet are used in algebra to represent known quantities.
290	Whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet (x,y,z) are used to denote unknown quantities.
290	Also, in geometry, the capital A, B, C etc.
290	Use in other languages In most languages that use the Latin alphabet, A denotes an open unrounded vowel:,, or.
290	An exception is Saanich, in which A (and Á) stand for a close-mid front unrounded vowel.
290	In the International Phonetic Alphabet, variants of A denote various vowels.
290	In X-SAMPA, capital A denotes the open back unrounded vowel and lowercase a denotes the open front unrounded vowel.

303	Alabama is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States.
303	It is bordered by Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west.
303	Alabama is the 30th-most extensive and the 23rd-most populous of the 50 United States.
303	At 1300 mi, Alabama has one of the longest navigable inland waterways in the nation.
303	From the American Civil War until World War II, Alabama, like many Southern states, suffered economic hardship, in part because of continued dependence on agriculture.
303	Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, white rural interests dominated the state legislature until the 1960s, while urban interests and African Americans were under-represented.
303	Following World War II, Alabama experienced growth as the economy of the state transitioned from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests.
303	The establishment or expansion of multiple United States Armed Forces installations added to the state economy and helped bridge the gap between an agricultural and industrial economy during the mid-20th century.
303	The state economy in the 21st century is dependent on management, automotive, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.
303	Alabama is unofficially nicknamed the Yellowhammer State, after the state bird.
303	Alabama is also known as the "Heart of Dixie."
303	The state tree is the Longleaf Pine, the state flower is the Camellia.
303	The capital of Alabama is Montgomery.
303	The largest city by population is Birmingham.
303	The largest city by total land area is Huntsville.
303	The oldest city is Mobile, founded by French colonists.
303	History Etymology The Alabama people, a Muskogean-speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa Rivers on the upper reaches of the Alabama River, served as the etymological source of the names of the river and state.
303	In the Alabama language, the word for an Alabama person is Albaamo (or variously Albaama or Albàamo in different dialects; the plural form "Alabama persons" is Albaamaha).
303	The word Alabama is believed to have originated from the Choctaw language and was later adopted by the Alabama tribe as their name.
303	The spelling of the word varies significantly between sources.
303	The first usage appears in three accounts of the Hernando de Soto expedition of 1540 with Garcilasso de la Vega using Alibamo, while the Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote Alibamu and Limamu, respectively.
303	As early as 1702, the tribe was known to the French as Alibamon with French maps identifying the river as Rivière des Alibamons.
303	Other spellings of the appellation have included Alibamu, Alabamo, Albama, Alebamon, Alibama, Alibamou, Alabamu, and Allibamou.
303	Although the origin of Alabama could be discerned, sources disagree on its meaning.
303	An 1842 article in the Jacksonville Republican originated the idea that the meaning was "Here We Rest."
303	This notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of Alexander Beaufort Meek.
303	Experts in the Muskogean languages have been unable to find any evidence to support such a translation.
303	Scholars believe the word comes from the Choctaw alba (meaning "plants" or "weeds") and amo (meaning "to cut", "to trim", or "to gather").
303	The meaning may have been "clearers of the thicket" or "herb gatherers" which may refer to clearing of land for cultivation or to collecting medicinal plants.
303	Alabama is but one of many place names in the state of Native American origin.
303	Pre-European settlement Indigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before European colonization.
303	Trade with the Northeast via the Ohio River began during the Burial Mound Period (1000 BC–AD 700) and continued until European contact.
303	The agrarian Mississippian culture covered most of the state from AD 1000 to 1600, with one of its major centers being at the Moundville Archaeological Site in Moundville, Alabama.
303	Analysis of artifacts recovered from archaeological excavations at Moundville were the basis of scholars' formulating the characteristics of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC).
303	Contrary to popular belief, the SECC appears to have no direct links to Mesoamerican culture, but developed independently.
303	The Ceremonial Complex represents a major component of the religion of the Mississippian peoples; it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood.
303	Among the historical tribes of Native American people living in the area of present-day Alabama at the time of European contact were  Iroquoian-speaking Cherokee, and the Muskogean-speaking Alabama (Alibamu), Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Koasati.
303	European settlement The French founded the first European settlement in the region at Old Mobile, in 1702.
303	The city was moved to the current site of Mobile in 1711.
303	This area was French from 1702 to 1763, part of British West Florida from 1763 to 1783, and split between the United States and Spain from 1783 to 1821.
303	Thomas Bassett, a loyalist to the British monarchy, was one of the earliest ett, a Tombigbee settlements, in what is now Washington County, during the early 1770s.
303	What is now the counties of Baldwin and Mobile became part of Spanish West Florida in 1783, part of the independent Republic of West Florida in 1810, and was finally added to the Mississippi Territory in 1812.
303	The area making up today's northern and central Alabama and Mississippi, then known as the Yazoo lands, had been claimed by the Province of Georgia after 1767.
303	Following the Revolutionary War, it remained a part of Georgia, although heavily disputed.
303	With the exception of the immediate area around Mobile and the Yazoo lands, what is now central Alabama was made part of the Mississippi Territory upon its creation in 1798.
303	The Yazoo lands were added to the territory in 1804, following the Yazoo land scandal.
303	Spain had kept a governmental presence in Mobile after 1812.
303	When Andrew Jackson's forces occupied Mobile in 1814, he demonstrated the United States' de facto authority over the region, which effectively ended Spanish influence, although not its claim, while gaining an unencumbered passage to the Gulf of Mexico from the hinterlands of the territory.
303	Prior to the admission of Mississippi as a state on December 10, 1817, the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the Alabama Territory.
303	The Alabama Territory was created by the United States Congress on March 3, 1817.
303	St.
303	Stephens, now abandoned, served as the territorial capital from 1817 to 1819.
303	Early statehood The U.S.
303	Congress selected Huntsville as the site for the first Constitutional Convention of Alabama after it was approved to become the 22nd  state.
303	From July 5 to August 2, 1819, delegates met to prepare the new state constitution.
303	Huntsville served as the temporary capital of Alabama from 1819 to 1820, when the seat of state government was moved to Cahaba in Dallas County.
303	Cahaba, now a ghost town, was the first permanent state capital from 1820 to 1825.
303	Alabama Fever was already underway when the state was admitted to the Union, with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation.
303	Part of the frontier in the 1820s and 1830s, its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men.
303	Southeastern planters and traders from the Upper South brought slaves with them as the cotton plantations in Alabama expanded.
303	The economy of the central Black Belt (named for its dark, productive soil) was built around large cotton plantations whose owners' wealth grew largely from slave labor.
303	The area also drew many poor, disfranchised people who became subsistence farmers.
303	Alabama had a population estimated at under 10,000 people in 1810, but it had increased to more than 300,000 people by 1830.
303	Most Native American tribes were completely removed from the state within a few years of the passage of the Indian Removal Act by Congress in 1830.
303	From 1826 to 1846, Tuscaloosa served as the capital of Alabama.
303	On January 30, 1846, the Alabama legislature announced that it had voted to remove the capital city from Tuscaloosa to Montgomery.
303	The first legislative session in the new capital met in December 1847.
303	A new capitol building was erected under the direction of Stephen Decatur Button of Philadelphia.
303	The first structure burned down in 1849, but was rebuilt on the same site in 1851.
303	This second capitol building in Montgomery remains to the present day.
303	It was designed by Barachias Holt of Exeter, Maine.
303	By 1860 the population had iAlabama Presncreased to a total of 964,201 people, of which 435,080 were enslaved African Americans and 2,690 were free people of color.
303	Civil War and Reconstruction On January 11, 1861, Alabama declared its secession from the Union.
303	After remaining an independent republic for a few days, it joined the Confederate States of America.
303	The Confederacy's capital was initially located at Montgomery.
303	Although comparatively few battles were fought in the state, Alabama contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the American Civil War.
303	Alabama's slaves were freed by the 13th Amendment in 1865.
303	A company of cavalry soldiers from Huntsville, Alabama joined Nathan Bedford Forrest's battalion in Hopkinsville, Kentucky.
303	The company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves, collar and coat tails.
303	This led to them being greeted with "Yellowhammer", and the name later was applied to all Alabama troops in the Confederate Army.
303	Alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in May 1865 until its official restoration to the Union in 1868.
303	From 1867 to 1874, with most white citizens barred from voting, many African Americans emerged as political leaders in the state.
303	Alabama was represented in Congress during this period by three African American congressmen: Jeremiah Haralson, Benjamin S.
303	Turner, and James T.
303	Rapier.
303	Following the war, the state was remained chiefly agricultural, with an economy tied to cotton.
303	During Reconstruction, state legislators ratified a new state constitution in 1868 that created a public school system for the first time and expanded women's rights.
303	Legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects, although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation.
303	Organized resistance groups also tried to suppress the freedmen and Republicans.
303	Besides the short-lived original Ku Klux Klan, these included the Pale Faces, Knights of the White Camellia, Red Shirts, and the White League.
303	Reconstruction in Alabama ended in 1874, when the Democrats regained control of the legislature and governor's office.
303	They wrote another constitution in 1875, and the legislature passed the Blaine Amendment, prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious affiliated schools.
303	The same year, legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools.
303	Railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891.
303	More Jim Crow laws were passed at the beginning of the 20th century to enforce segregation in everyday life.
303	The new 1901 Constitution of Alabama included electoral laws that effectively disfranchised African Americans and most poor whites through voting restrictions, including poll taxes and literacy requirements.
303	While the planter class had persuaded poor whites to support these legislative efforts, the new restrictions resulted in their disfranchisement as well, due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax.
303	In 1900, Alabama had more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote.
303	By 1903, only 2,980 had qualified to register, although at least 74,000 black voters were literate.
303	By 1941, more white Alabamians than black had been disfranchised: 600,000 whites to 520,000 blacks.
303	Nearly all African Americans had lost the ability to vote.
303	The 1901 constitution reiterated that schools be racially segregated.
303	It also restated that interracial marriage was illegal, although it had already been against the law since 1867.
303	Further racial segregation laws were passed into the 1950s: jails in 1911; hospitals in 1915; toilets, hotels, and restaurants in 1928; and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945.
303	The rural-dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disfranchised African Americans, but it did not relieve them of paying taxes.
303	Partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South, the Rosenwald Fund began funding the building of what came to be known as Rosenwald Schools.
303	In Alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with Rosenwald funds, which paid one-third of the construction costs.
303	The local community and state paid the rest.
303	Beginning in 1913, the first 80 Rosenwald Schools were built in Alabama.
303	A total of 387 schools, 7 teacher's houses, and several vocational buildools were ings had been completed in the state by 1937.
303	Several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
303	Continued racial discrimination, agricultural depression, and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans to seek opportunities in northern cities.
303	They left Alabama in the early 20th century as part of the Great Migration to industrial jobs and better futures in northern industrial cities.
303	The population growth rate in Alabama (see "Historical Populations" table below) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920, reflecting this emigration.
303	At the same time, many rural whites and blacks moved to the city of Birmingham to work in new industrial jobs.
303	Birmingham experienced such rapid growth that it was called "The Magic City".
303	By the 1920s, Birmingham was the 19th largest city in the United States and had more than 30% of the Alabama's population.
303	Heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy.
303	Industrial development related to the demands of World War II brought a level of prosperity not seen since before the Civil War.
303	Rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living.
303	One example of this massive influx of workers can be shown by what happened in Mobile.
303	Between 1940 and 1943, more than 89,000 people moved into the city to work for war effort industries.
303	Cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base.
303	Despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population.
303	They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas.
303	In addition, the state legislature gerrymandered the few Birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside Birmingham.
303	One result was that Jefferson County, containing Birmingham's industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services.
303	Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature.
303	A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, "A minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature."
303	African Americans were presumed partial to Republicans for historical reasons, but they were disfranchised.
303	White Alabamans felt bitter towards the Republican Party in the aftermath of the Civil War and Reconstruction.
303	These factors created a longstanding tradition that any candidate who wanted to be viable with white voters had to run as a Democrat regardless of political beliefs.
303	Although efforts had already started decades earlier, African Americans began to more actively attempt to end the disfranchisement and segregation in the state during the 1950s and 1960s with the Civil Rights Movement.
303	These efforts directly led to the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 by the U.S.
303	Congress.
303	During the 1960s, under Governor George Wallace, failed attempts were made at the state level to resist federally-sanctioned desegregation efforts.
303	During the Civil Rights Movement, African Americans achieved a protection of voting and other civil rights through the passage of the national Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
303	Legal segregation ended in the states as Jim Crow laws were invalidated or repealed.
303	Under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, cases were filed in Federal courts to force Alabama to redistrict by population both the House and Senate of the state legislature.
303	In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature implemented the Alabama constitution's provision for periodic redistricting based on population.
303	This benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than 60 years.
303	Geography Alabama is the thirtieth-largest state in the United States with 52419 sqmi of total area: 3.2% of the area is water, making Alabama 23rd in the amount of surface water, also giving it the second-largest inland waterway system in the U.S.
303	About three-fifths of the land area is a gentle plain with a general descent towards the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico.

303	A notable natural wonder in Alabama is "Natural Bridge" rock, the longest natural bridge east of the Rockies, located just south of Haleyville.
303	A 5 mi-wide meteorite impact crater is located in Elmore County, just north of Montgomery.
303	This is the Wetumpka crater, the site of "Alabama's greatest natural disaster."
303	A 1000 ft-wide meteorite hit the area about 80 million years ago.
303	The hills just east of downtown Wetumpka showcase the eroded remains of the impact crater that was blasted into the bedrock, with the area labeled the Wetumpka crater or astrobleme ("star-wound") because of the concentric rings of fractures and zones of shattered rock that can be found beneath the surface.
303	In 2002, Christian Koeberl with the Institute of Geochemistry University of Vienna published evidence and established the site as 157th recognized impact crater on Earth.
303	The northernmost point of Alabama lies approximately six miles northwest of Waterloo in Lauderdale County in the far northwest corner of the state.
303	The southernmost point is Sand Island, near Dauphin Island, in Mobile County.

303	Those citing "American" ancestry in Alabama are of overwhelmingly English extraction, however most English Americans identify simply as having American ancestry because their roots have been in North America for so long, in some cases since the 1600s.
303	Demographers estimate that a minimum of 20–23% of people in Alabama are of predominantly English ancestry and state that the figure is probably much higher.
303	In the 1980 census, 41% of the people in Alabama cited that they were of English ancestry, making them the largest ethnic group at the time.
303	There are also many more people in Alabama of Scots-Irish origins than are self-reported.
303	Many people in Alabama claim Irish ancestry because of the term Scots-Irish, but most of the time in Alabama this term is used for those with Scottish roots, rather than Irish.

303	At almost 800 amendments and 310,000 words, it is the world's longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the U.S.
303	Constitution.
303	There has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama's constitution.
303	This movement is based upon the fact that Alabama's constitution highly centralizes power in Montgomery and leaves practically no power in local hands.
303	Any policy changes proposed around the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum.
303	One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length were intentional to codify segregation and racism.
305	In Greek mythology, Achilles (, Akhilleus,) was a Greek hero of the Trojan War and the central character and greatest warrior of Homer's Iliad.
305	Achilles was a demigod; his mother was the nymph Thetis, and his father, Peleus, was the king of the Myrmidons.
305	Achilles’ most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan hero Hector outside the gates of Troy.
305	Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the Iliad, other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by Paris, who shot him in the heel with an arrow.
305	Later legends (beginning with a poem by Statius in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel.
305	Because of his death from a small wound in the heel, the term Achilles' heel has come to mean a person's point of weakness.
305	Etymology  Achilles' name can be analyzed as a combination of  (akhos) "grief" and  (Laos) "a people, tribe, nation, etc."
305	In other words, Achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people, grief being a theme raised numerous times in the Iliad (frequently by Achilles).
305	Achilles' role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of Achilles as the hero of kleos (glory, usually glory in war).
305	Laos has been construed by Gregory Nagy, following Leonard Palmer, to mean a corps of soldiers, a muster.
305	With this derivation, the name would have a double meaning in the poem: When the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring grief to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war.
305	The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.
305	The name Achilleus was a common and attested name among the Greeks soon after the 7th century BC.
305	It was also turned into the female form Ἀχιλλεία (Achilleía) attested in Attica in the 4th century BC (IG II² 1617) and, in the form Achillia, on a stele in Halicarnassus as the name of a female gladiator fighting an "Amazon".
305	Roman gladiatorial games often referenced classical mythology, and this seems to reference Achilles' fight with Penthesilea but gives it an extra twist of Achilles being "played" by a woman.
305	Birth  Achilles was the son of the nymph Thetis and Peleus, the king of the Myrmidons.
305	Zeus and Poseidon had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until Prometheus, the fore-thinker, warned Zeus of a prophecy that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father.
305	For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed  Peleus.
305	As with most mythology, there is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events: in Argonautica (iv.760) Zeus' sister and wife Hera alludes to Thetis' chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus, that Thetis was so loyal to Hera's marriage bond that she coolly rejected him.
305	Thetis, although a daughter of the sea-god Nereus, was also brought up by Hera, further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus.
305	According to the Achilleid, written by Statius in the 1st century AD, and to no surviving previous sources, when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal, by dipping him in the river Styx.
305	However, he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him, his heel (see Achilles heel, Achilles' tendon).
305	It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier.
305	In another version of this story, Thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of a fire, to burn away the mortal parts of his body.
305	She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage.
305	However, none of the sources before Statius makes any reference to this general invulnerability.
305	To the contrary, in the Iliad Homer mentions Achilles being wounded: in Book 21 the Paeonian hero Asteropaeus, son of Pelagon, challenged Achilles by the river Scamander.
305	He cast two spears at once, one grazed Achilles' elbow, "drawing a spurt of blood".
305	Also, in the fragmentary poems of the Epic Cycle in which we can find description of the hero's death, Cypria (unknown author), Aithiopis by Arctinus of Miletus, Little Iliad by Lesche of Mytilene, Iliou persis by Arctinus of Miletus, there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness (heel); in the later vase paintings presenting Achilles' death, the arrow (or in many cases, arrows) hit his body.

305	Achilles in the Trojan War  The Rage of Achilles, by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo The first two lines of the Iliad read: : Sing, Goddess, of the rage of Peleus' son Achilles, the accursed rage that brought great suffering to the Achaeans.
305	Achilles' consuming rage is at times wavering, but at other times he cannot be cooled.
305	The humanization of Achilles by the events of the war is an important theme of the narrative.
305	According to the Iliad, Achilles arrived at Troy with 50 ships, each carrying 50 Myrmidons (Book 2).
305	He appointed five leaders (each leader commanding 500 Myrmidons): Menesthius, Eudorus, Peisander, Phoenix and Alcimedon (Book 16).
305	Telephus  When the Greeks left for the Trojan War, they accidentally stopped in Mysia, ruled by King Telephus.
305	In the resulting battle, Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal; Telephus consulted an oracle, who stated that "he that wounded shall heal".
305	Guided by the oracle, he arrived at Argos, where Achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to Troy.
305	According to other reports in Euripides' lost play about Telephus, he went to Aulis pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound.
305	Achilles refused, claiming to have no medical knowledge.
305	Alternatively, Telephus held Orestes for ransom, the ransom being Achilles' aid in healing the wound.
305	Odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound; therefore, the spear must be able to heal it.
305	Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Telephus was healed.
305	Troilus  According to the Cypria (the part of the Epic Cycle that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles' Wrath), when the Achaeans desired to return home, they were restrained by Achilles, who afterwards attacked the cattle of Aeneas, sacked neighboring cities and killed Troilus.
305	According to Dares Phrygius' Account of the Destruction of Troy, the Latin summary through which the story of Achilles was transmitted to medieval Europe, Troilus was a young Trojan prince, the youngest of King Priam's (or sometimes Apollo) and Hecuba's five legitimate sons.
305	Despite his youth, he was one of the main Trojan war leaders.
305	Prophecies linked Troilus' fate to that of Troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him.
305	Yet Achilles, struck by the beauty of both Troilus and his sister Polyxena, and overcome with lust, directed his sexual attentions on the youth – who refusing to yield found instead himself decapitated upon an altar-omphalos of Apollo.
305	Later versions of the story suggested Troilus was accidentally killed by Achilles in an over-ardent lovers' embrace.
305	In this version of the myth, Achilles' death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege.
305	Ancient writers treated Troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents.
305	Had Troilus lived to adulthood, the First Vatican Mythographer claimed Troy would have been invincible.
305	Achilles in the Iliad  Homer's Iliad is the most famous narrative of Achilles' deeds in the Trojan War.
305	Achilles' wrath is the central theme of the book.
305	The Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the war, and does not narrate Achilles' death.
305	It begins with Achilles' withdrawal from battle after he is dishonored by Agamemnon, the commander of the Achaean forces.
305	Agamemnon had taken a woman named Chryseis as his slave.
305	Her father Chryses, a priest of Apollo, begged Agamemnon to return her to him.
305	Agamemnon refused and Apollo sent a plague amongst the Greeks.
305	The prophet Calchas correctly determined the source of the troubles but would not speak unless Achilles vowed to protect him.
305	Achilles did so and Calchas declared Chryseis must be returned to her father.
305	Agamemnon consented, but then commanded that Achilles' battle prize Briseis be brought to replace Chryseis.
305	Angry at the dishonor of having his plunder and glory taken away (and as he says later, because he loved Briseis), with the urging of his mother Thetis, Achilles refused to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces.
305	At this same time, burning with rage over Agamemnon's theft, Achilles prayed to Thetis to convince Zeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war, so that he may regain his honor.
305	As the battle turned against the Greeks, thanks to the influence of Zeus, Nestor declared that the Trojans were winning because Agamemnon had angered Achilles, and urged the king to appease the warrior.
305	Agamemnon agreed and sent Odysseus and two other chieftains, Ajax and Phoenix, to Achilles with the offer of the return of Briseis and other gifts.
305	Achilles rejected all Agamemnon offered him, and simply urged the Greeks to sail home as he was planning to do.
305	The Trojans, led by Hector, subsequently pushed the Greek army back toward the beaches and assaulted the Greek ships.
305	With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction, Patroclus led the Myrmidons into battle wearing Achilles' armor, though Achilles remained at his camp.
305	Patroclus succeeded in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches, but was killed by Hector before he could lead a proper assault on the city of Troy.
305	After receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from Antilochus, the son of Nestor, Achilles grieved over his beloved companion's death and held many funeral games in his honor.
305	His mother Thetis came to comfort the distraught Achilles.
305	She persuaded Hephaestus to make a new armor for him, in place of the armor that Patroclus had been wearing which was taken by Hector.
305	The new armor included the Shield of Achilles, described in great detail by the poet.
305	Enraged over the death of Patroclus, Achilles ended his refusal to fight and took the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector.
305	Achilles even engaged in battle with the river god Scamander who became angry that Achilles was choking his waters with all the men he killed.
305	The god tried to drown Achilles but was stopped by Hera and Hephaestus.
305	Zeus himself took note of Achilles' rage and sent the gods to restrain him so that he would not go on to sack Troy itself, seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles could defy fate itself as Troy was not meant to be destroyed yet.
305	Finally, Achilles found his prey.
305	Achilles chased Hector around the wall of Troy tbe destroyed yet.
305	Finally, Achilles found his prey.
305	Achilles chased Hector around three times before Athena, in the form of Hector's favorite and dearest brother, Deiphobus, persuaded Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face.
305	After Hector realized the trick, he knew the battle was inevitable.
305	Wanting to go down fighting, he charged at Achilles with his only weapon, his sword, but missed.
305	Accepting his fate, Hector begged Achilles, not to spare his life, but to treat his body with respect after killing him.
305	Achilles told Hector it was hopeless to expect that of him, declaring that "my rage, my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw – such agonies you have caused me".
305	Achilles then got his vengeance.
305	With the assistance of the god Hermes, Hector's father, Priam, went to Achilles' tent to plead with Achilles to permit him to perform for Hector his funeral rites.
305	Achilles relented and promised a truce for the duration of Hector's funeral.
305	The final passage in the Iliad is Hector's funeral, after which the doom of Troy was just a matter of time.
305	Penthesilea  Achilles, after his temporary truce with Priam, fought and killed the Amazonian warrior queen Penthesilea, but later grieved over her death.
305	At first, he was so distracted by her beauty, he did not fight as intensely as usual.
305	Once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life, he refocused and killed her.
305	As he grieved over the death of such a rare beauty, a notorious Greek jeerer by the name of Thersites laughed and mocked the great Achilles.
305	Memnon, and the fall of Achilles  Following the death of Patroclus, Achilles' closest companion was Nestor's son Antilochus.
305	When Memnon, king of Ethiopia slew Antilochus, Achilles once more obtained revenge on the battlefield, killing Memnon.
305	The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus, except that Memnon (unlike Hector) was also the son of a goddess.
305	Many Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the Iliads description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles' reaction to it.
305	The episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic Aethiopis, which was composed after the Iliad, possibly in the 7th century B.C.
305	The Aethiopis is now lost, except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors.
305	The death of Achilles, as predicted by Hector with his dying breath, was brought about by Paris with an arrow (to the heel according to Statius).
305	In some versions, the god Apollo guided Paris' arrow.
305	Some retellings also state that Achilles was scaling the gates of Troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow.
305	All of these versions deny Paris any sort of valor, owing to the common conception that Paris was a coward and not the man his brother Hector was, and Achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield.
305	His bones were mingled with those of Patroclus, and funeral games were held.
305	He was represented in the Aethiopis as living after his death in the island of Leuke at the mouth of the river Danube.
305	Another version of Achilles' death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the Trojan princesses, Polyxena.
305	Achilles asks Priam for Polyxena's hand in marriage.
305	Priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world's greatest warrior.
305	But while Priam is overseeing the private marriage of Polyxena and Achilles, Paris, who would have to give up Helen if Achilles married his sister, hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow, killing him.
305	Achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of Patroclus.
305	Paris was later killed by Philoctetes using the enormous bow of Heracles.
305	Fate of Achilles' armor  Achilles' armor was the object of a feud between Odysseus and Telamonian Ajax (Ajax the greater).
305	They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners, who after considering both men came to a consensus in favor of Odysseus.
305	Furious, Ajax cursed Odysseus, which earned the ire of Athena.
305	Athena temporarily made Ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep, thinking them his comrades.
305	After a while, when Athena lifted his madness and Ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep, Ajax was left so ashamed that he committed suicide.
305	Odysseus eventually gave the armor to Neoptolemus, the son of Achilles.
305	A relic claimed to be Achilles' bronze-headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of Athena on the acropolis of Phaselis, Lycia, a port on the Pamphylian Gulf.
305	The city was visited in 333 BC by Alexander the Great, who envisioned himself as the new Achilles and carried the Iliad with him, but his court biographers do not mention the spear, which he would indeed have touched with excitement.
305	But it was being shown in the time of Pausanias in the 2nd century AD.
305	Achilles and Patroclus  The exact nature of Achilles' relationship with Patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times.
305	In the Iliad, it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship, but commentators from classical antiquity to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures.
305	In 5th-century BC Athens, the intense bond was often viewed in light of the Greek custom of paiderasteia.
305	In Plato's Symposium, the participants in a dialogue about love assume that Achilles and Patroclus were a couple; Phaedrus argues that Achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and Patroclus was the lover.
305	But ancient Greek had no words to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual, and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women.
305	Although epic decorum excluded explicit sexuality, the Iliad indicates that Achilles had sexual relations with women, with no direct evidence of sexual behaviors with Patroclus.
305	Worship of Achilles in antiquity  There was an archaic heroic cult of Achilles on the White Island, Leuce, in the Black Sea off the modern coasts of Romania and Ukraine, with a temple and an oracle which survived into the Roman period.
305	In the lost epic  Aithiopis, a continuation of the Iliad attributed to Arktinus of Miletos,  Achilles’ mother Thetis returned to mourn  him and removed his ashes from the pyre and took them to Leuce at the mouths of the Danube.
305	There the Achaeans raised a tumulus for him and celebrated funeral games.
305	Pliny's Natural History mentions a tumulus that is no longer evident (Insula Akchillis tumulo eius viri clara), on the island consecrated to him, located at a distance of fifty Roman miles from Peuce by the Danube Delta, and the temple there.
305	Pausanias has been told that the island is "covered with forests and full of animals, some wild, some tame.
305	In this island there is also Achilles’ temple and his statue".
305	Ruins of a square temple 30 meters to a side, possibly that dedicated to Achilles, were discovered by Captain Kritzikly in 1823, but there has been no modern archeological work done on the island.
305	Pomponius Mela tells that Achilles is buried in the island named Achillea, between Boristhene and Ister.
305	The Greek geographer Dionysius Periegetus of Bithynia, who lived at the time of Domitian, writes that the island was called Leuce "because the wild animals which live there are white.
305	It is said that there, in Leuce island, reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes, and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island; this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues, because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honor".
305	The Periplus of the Euxine Sea gives the following details: "It is said that the goddess Thetis raised this island from the sea, for her son Achilles, who dwells there.
305	Here is his temple and his statue, an archaic work.
305	This island is not inhabited, and goats graze on it, not many, which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships, sacrifice to Achilles.
305	In this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts, craters, rings and precious stones, offered to Achilles in gratitude.
305	One can still read inscriptions in Greek and Latin, in which Achilles is praised and celebrated.
305	Some of these are worded in Patroclus’ honor, because those who wish to be favored by Achilles, honor Patroclus at the same time.
305	There are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds, which look after Achilles’ temple.
305	Every morning they fly out to sea, wet their wings with water, and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it.
305	And after they finish the sprinkling, they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings.
305	Other people say still more, that some of the men who reach this island, come here intentionally.
305	They bring animals in their ships, destined to be sacrificed.
305	Some of these animals they slaughter, others they set free on the island, in Achilles’ honor.
305	But there are others, who are forced to come to this island by sea storms.
305	As they have no sacrificial animals, but wish to get them from the god of the island himself, they consult Achilles’ oracle.
305	They ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island, and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair.
305	But in case the oracle denies them permission, because there is an oracle here, they add something to the price offered, and if the oracle refuses again, they add something more, until at last, the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient.
305	And then the victim doesn’t run away any more, but waits willingly to be caught.
305	So, there is a great quantity of silver there, consecrated to the hero, as price for the sacrificial victims.
305	To some of the people who come to this island, Achilles appears in dreams, to others he would appear even during their navigation, if they were not too far away, and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships".
305	Densuşianu) The heroic cult of Achilles on Leuce island was widespread in antiquity, not only along the sea lanes of the Pontic Sea but also in maritime cities whose economic interests were tightly connected to the riches of the Black Sea.
305	Achilles from Leuce island was venerated as Pontarches the lord and master of the Pontic Sea, the protector of sailors and navigation.
305	Sailors went out of their way to offer sacrifice.
305	To Achilles of Leuce  were dedicated a number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters: Achilleion in Messenia (Stephanus Byzantinus), Achilleios in Laconia (Pausanias, III.25,4) Nicolae Densuşianu (Densuşianu 1913) even though he recognized Achilles in the name of Aquileia and in the north arm of the Danube delta, the arm of Chilia ("Achileii"), though his conclusion, that Leuce had sovereign rights over Pontos, evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law."
305	Leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing.
305	Pausanias (III.19,13) reports that the Delphic Pythia sent a lord of Croton to be cured of a chest wound.
305	Ammianus Marcellinus (XXII.8) attributes the healing to waters (aquae) on the island.
305	Worship of Achilles in modern times: The Achilleion in Corfu  In the region of Gastouri (Γαστούρι) to the south of the city of Corfu Greece, Empress of Austria Elisabeth of Bavaria also known as Sissi built in 1890 a summer palace with Achilles as its central theme and it is a monument to platonic romanticism.
305	The palace, naturally, was named after Achilles: Achilleion (Αχίλλειον).
305	This elegant structure abounds with paintings and statues of Achilles both in the main hall and in the lavish gardens depicting the heroic and tragic scenes of the Trojan war.
305	Other stories  Some post-Homeric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war, Thetis (or, in some versions, Peleus) hides the young man at the court of Lycomedes, king of Skyros.
305	There, Achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among Lycomedes' daughters, perhaps under the name "Pyrrha" (the red-haired girl).
305	With Lycomedes' daughter Deidamia, whom in the account of Statius he rapes, Achilles there fathers a son, Neoptolemus (also called Pyrrhus, after his father's possible alias).
305	According to this story, Odysseus learns from the prophet Calchas that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles' aid.
305	Odysseus goes to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women's clothes and jewelry and places a shield and spear among his goods.
305	When Achilles instantly takes up the spear, Odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the Greek campaign.
305	In another version of the story, Odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes' women; while the women flee in panic, Achilles prepares to defend the court, thus giving his identity away.
305	In book 11 of Homer's Odyssey, Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades.
305	One of these is Achilles, who when greeted as "blessed in life, blessed in death", responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead.
305	But Achsponds that he would rather be a slave to the worst oilles then asks Odysseus of his son's exploits in the Trojan war, and when Odysseus tells of Neoptolemus' heroic actions, Achilles is filled with satisfaction.
305	This leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how Achilles felt about the heroic life.
305	Achilles was worshipped as a sea-god in many of the Greek colonies on the Black Sea, the location of the mythical "White Island" which he was said to inhabit after his death, together with many other heroes.
305	The kings of the Epirus claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son, Neoptolemus.
305	Alexander the Great, son of the Epirote princess Olympias, could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor.
305	He is said to have visited the tomb of Achilles at Achilleion while passing Troy.
305	In AD 216 the Roman Emperor Caracalla, while on his way to war against Parthia, emulated Alexander by holding games around Achilles' tumulus.
305	Achilles fought and killed the Amazon Helene.
305	Some also said he married Medea, and that after both their deaths they were united in the Elysian Fields of Hades – as Hera promised Thetis in Apollonius' Argonautica.
305	In some versions of the myth, Achilles has a relationship with his captive Briseis.
305	Achilles in Greek tragedy  The Greek tragedian Aeschylus wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles, given the title Achilleis by modern scholars.
305	The tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the Trojan War, including his defeat of Hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by Paris and guided by Apollo punctures his heel.
305	Extant fragments of the Achilleis and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play.
305	The first part of the Achilleis trilogy, The Myrmidons, focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus, who represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon; only a few lines survive today.
305	In Plato's Symposium, Phaedrus points out that Aeschylus portrayed Achilles as the lover and Patroclus as the beloved; Phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because Achilles, being the younger and more beautiful of the two, was the beloved, who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to revenge him.
305	The tragedian Sophocles also wrote The Lovers of Achilles, a play with Achilles as the main character.
305	Only a few fragments survive.
305	Achilles in Greek philosophy  The philosopher Zeno of Elea centered one of his paradoxes on an imaginary footrace between "swift-footed" Achilles and a tortoise, by which he attempted to show that Achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start, and therefore that motion and change were impossible.
305	As a student of the monist Parmenides and a member of the Eleatic school, Zeno believed time and motion to be illusions.

307	Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was the 16th President of the United States, serving from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865.
307	Lincoln led the United States through its greatest constitutional, military, and moral crises—the American Civil War—preserving the Union, abolishing slavery, strengthening the national government and modernizing the economy.
307	Reared in a poor family on the western frontier, Lincoln was self-educated, and became a country lawyer, a Whig Party leader, Illinois state legislator during the 1830s, and a one-term member of the United States House of Representatives during the 1840s.
307	After a series of debates in 1858 that gave national visibility to his opposition to the expansion of slavery, Lincoln lost a Senate race to his arch-rival, Stephen A.
307	Douglas.
307	Lincoln, a moderate from a swing state, secured the Republican Party presidential nomination in 1860.
307	With almost no support in the South, Lincoln swept the North and was North and was United Spresident in 1860.
307	His election was the signal for seven southern slave states to declare their secession from the Union and form the Confederacy.
307	The departure of the Southerners gave Lincoln's party firm control of Congress, but no formula for compromise or reconciliation was found.
307	Lincoln explained in his second inaugural address: "Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the Nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came."
307	When the North enthusiastically rallied behind the national flag after the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861, Lincoln concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war effort.
307	His goal was now to reunite the nation.
307	As the South was in a state of insurrection, Lincoln exercised his authority to suspend habeas corpus, arresting and temporarily detaining thousands of suspected secessionists without trial.
307	Lincoln averted British recognition of the Confederacy by skillfully handling the Trent affair in late 1861.
307	His efforts toward the abolition of slavery include issuing his Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, encouraging the border states to outlaw slavery, and helping push through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which finally freed all the slaves nationwide in December 1865.
307	Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including commanding general Ulysses S.
307	Grant.
307	Lincoln brought leaders of the major factions of his party into his cabinet and pressured them to cooperate.
307	Under Lincoln's leadership, the Union set up a naval blockade that shut down the South's normal trade, took control of the border slave states at the start of the war, gained control of communications with gunboats on the southern river systems, and tried repeatedly to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia.
307	Each time a general failed, Lincoln substituted another until finally Grant succeeded in 1865.
307	An exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state, Lincoln reached out to War Democrats and managed his own re-election in the 1864 presidential election.
307	As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican party, Lincoln found his policies and personality were "blasted from all sides": Radical Republicans demanded harsher treatment of the South, War Democrats desired more compromise, Copperheads despised him, and irreconcilable secessionists plotted his death.
307	Politically, Lincoln fought back with patronage, by pitting his opponents against each other, and by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory.
307	His Gettysburg Address of 1863 became the most quoted speech in American history.
307	It was an iconic statement of America's dedication to the principles of nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy.
307	At the close of the war, Lincoln held a moderate view of Reconstruction, seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness.
307	Six days after the surrender of Confederate commanding general Robert E.
307	Lee, however, Lincoln was assassinated by actor and Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth.
307	Lincoln's death was the first assassination of a U.S.
307	Lincoln has been consistently ranked by scholars and the public as one of the three greatest U.S.
307	George Washington and Franklin D.
307	Roosevelt, and by the public, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton.
307	Family and childhood Early life Abraham Lincoln was born February 12, 1809, the second child of Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Lincoln (née Hanks), in a one-room log cabin on the Sinking Spring Farm in Hardin County, Kentucky (now LaRue County).
307	He is descended from Samuel Lincoln, who arrived in Hingham, Massachusetts, from Norfolk, England, in the 17th century.
307	Lincoln's paternal grandfather and namesake, Abraham, had moved his family from Virginia to Kentucky, where he was ambushed and killed in an Indian raid in 1786, with his children, including Lincoln's father Thomas, looking on.
307	Thomas was left to make his own way on the frontier.
307	Lincoln's mother, Nancy, was the daughter of Lucy Hanks, and was born in what is now Mineral County, West Virginia, then part of Virginia.
307	Lucy moved with Nancy to Kentucky.
307	Nancy Hanks married Thomas, who became a respected citizen.
307	He bought and sold several farms, including Knob Creek Farm.
307	The family attended a Separate Baptists church, which had restrictive moral standards and opposed alcohol, dancing, and slavery.
307	Thomas enjoyed considerable status in Kentucky—where he sat on juries, appraised estates, served on country slave patrols, and guarded prisoners.
307	By the time his son Abraham was born, Thomas owned two 600 acre farms, several town lots, livestock, and horses.
307	He was among the richest men in the county.
307	However, in 1816, Thomas lost all of his land in court cases because of faulty property titles.
307	The family moved north across the Ohio River to free (i.e., non-slave) territory and made a new start in what was then Perry County but is now Spencer County, Indiana.
307	Lincoln later noted that this move was "partly on account of slavery" but mainly due to land title difficulties.
307	In Indiana, when Lincoln was nine, his mother Nancy died of milk sickness in 1818.
307	After the death of Lincoln's mother, his older sister, Sarah, took charge of caring for him until their father remarried in 1819; Sarah later died in her 20s while giving birth to a stillborn son.
307	Thomas Lincoln's new wife was the widow Sarah Bush Johnston, the mother of three children.
307	Lincoln became very close to his stepmother, and referred to her as "Mother".
307	As a pre-teen, he did not like the hard labor associated with frontier life.
307	Some in his family, and in the neighborh did not like the harood, for a time considered him to be lazy.
307	As he grew into his teens, he willingly took responsibility for all chores expected of him as one of the boys in the household and became an adept axeman in his work building rail fences.
307	He attained a reputation for brawn and audacity after a very competitive wrestling match to which he was challenged by the renowned leader of a group of ruffians, "the Clary's Grove boys".
307	Lincoln also agreed with the customary obligation of a son to give his father all earnings from work done outside the home until age 21.
307	In later years, Lincoln occasionally loaned his father money.
307	Lincoln became increasingly distant from his father, in part because of his father's lack of education.
307	While young Lincoln's formal education consisted approximately of a year's worth of classes from several itinerant teachers, he was mostly self-educated and was an avid reader and often sought access to any new books in the village.
307	He read and reread the King James Bible, Aesop's Fables, Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, and Franklin's Autobiography.
307	In 1830, fearing a milk sickness outbreak along the Ohio River, the Lincoln family moved west, where they settled on public land in Macon County, Illinois, another free, non-slave state.
307	In 1831, Thomas relocated the family to a new homestead in Coles County, Illinois.
307	It was then that, as an ambitious 22-year-old who was now old enough to make his own decisions, Lincoln struck out on his own.
307	Canoeing down the Sangamon River, Lincoln ended up in the village of New Salem in Sangamon County.
307	In the spring of 1831, hired by New Salem businessman Denton Offutt and accompanied by friends, he took goods by flatboat from New Salem to New Orleans via the Sangamon, Illinois, and Mississippi rivers.
307	After arriving in New Orleans—and witnessing slavery firsthand—he walked back home.
307	Marriage and children Lincoln's first romantic interest was Ann Rutledge, whom he met when he first moved to New Salem; by 1835, they were in a relationship but not formally engaged.
307	She died at the age of 22 on August 25, 1835, most likely of typhoid fever.
307	In the early 1830s, he met Mary Owens from Kentucky when she was visiting her sister.
307	Late in 1836, Lincoln agreed to a match with Mary if she returned to New Salem.
307	Mary did return in November 1836, and Lincoln courted her for a time; however, they both had second thoughts about their relationship.
307	On August 16, 1837, Lincoln wrote Mary a letter suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship.
307	She never replied and the courtship ended.
307	In 1840, Lincoln became engaged to Mary Todd, who was from a wealthy slave-holding family in Lexington, Kentucky.
307	They met in Springfield, Illinois, in December 1839 and were engaged the following December.
307	A wedding set for January 1, 1841, was canceled when the two broke off their engagement at Lincoln's initiative.
307	They later met again at a party and married on November 4, 1842, in the Springfield mansion of Mary's married sister.
307	While preparing for the nuptials and feeling anxiety again, Lincoln, when asked where he was going, replied, "To hell, I suppose."
307	In 1844, the couple bought a house in Springfield near Lincoln's law office.
307	Mary Todd Lincoln kept house, often with the help of a relative or hired servant girl.
307	Robert Todd Lincoln was born in 1843 and Edward Baker Lincoln (Eddie) in 1846.
307	Lincoln "was remarkably fond of children", and the Lincolns were not considered to be strict with their children.
307	Edward died on February 1, 1850, in Springfield, probably of tuberculosis.
307	"Willie" Lincoln was born on December 21, 1850, and died on February 20, 1862.
307	The Lincolns' fourth son, Thomas "Tad" Lincoln, was born on April 4, 1853, and died of heart failure at the age of 18 on July 16, 1871.
307	Robert was the only child to live to adulthood and have children.
307	His last descendant, grandson Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith, died in 1985.
307	The deaths of their sons had profound effects on both parents.
307	Later in life, Mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons, and Robert Lincoln committed her temporarily to a mental health asylum in 1875.
307	Abraham Lincoln suffered from "melancholy", a condition which now is referred to as clinical depression.
307	Lincoln's father-in-law was based in Lexington, Kentucky; he and others of the Todd family were either slave owners or slave traders.
307	Lincoln was close to the Todds, and he and his family occasionally visited the Todd estate in Lexington.
307	He was an affectionate, though often absent, husband and father of four children.
307	Early career and militia service In 1832, at age 23, Lincoln and a partner bought a small general store on credit in New Salem, Illinois.
307	Although the economy was booming in the region, the business struggled and Lincoln eventually sold his share.
307	That March he began his political career with his first campaign for the Illinois General Assare.
307	That March he began his politicalembly.
307	He had attained local popularity and could draw crowds as a natural raconteur in New Salem, though he lacked an education, powerful friends, and money, which may be why he lost.
307	He advocated navigational improvements on the Sangamon River.
307	Before the election, Lincoln served as a captain in the Illinois Militia during the Black Hawk War.
307	Following his return, Lincoln continued his campaign for the August 6 election for the Illinois General Assembly.
307	At 6 ft, he was tall and "strong enough to intimidate any rival".
307	At his first speech, when he saw a supporter in the crowd being attacked, Lincoln grabbed the assailant by his "neck and the seat of his trousers" and threw him.
307	Lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates (the top four were elected), though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct.
307	Lincoln served as New Salem's postmaster and later as county surveyor, all the while reading voraciously.
307	He then decided to become a lawyer and began teaching himself law by reading Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England and other law books.
307	Of his learning method, Lincoln stated: "I studied with nobody".
307	His second campaign in 1834 was successful.
307	He won election to the state legislature; though he ran as a Whig, many Democrats favored him over a more powerful Whig opponent.
307	Admitted to the bar in 1836, he moved to Springfield, Illinois, and began to practice law under John T.
307	Stuart, Mary Todd's cousin.
307	Lincoln became an able and successful lawyer with a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and closing arguments.
307	He partnered with Stephen T.
307	Logan from 1841 until 1844, when he began his practice with William Herndon, whom Lincoln thought "a studious young man".
307	He served four successive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives as a Whig representative from Sangamon County.
307	In the 1835–36 legislative session, he voted to expand suffrage to white males, whether landowners or not.
307	He was known for his "free soil" stance of opposing both slavery and abolitionism.
307	He first articulated this in 1837, saying, "[The] Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy, but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils."
307	He closely followed Henry Clay in supporting the American Colonization Society program of making the abolition of slavery practical by helping the freed slaves to settle in Liberia in Africa.
307	Congressman Lincoln From the early 1830s, Lincoln was a steadfast Whig and professed to friends in 1861 to be, "an old line Whig, a disciple of Henry Clay".
307	The party, including Lincoln, favored economic modernization in banking, protective tariffs to fund internal improvements including railroads, and espoused urbanization as well.
307	In 1846, Lincoln was elected to the U.S.
307	House of Representatives, where he served one two-year term.
307	He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation, but he showed his party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line.
307	Lincoln, in collaboration with abolitionist Congressman Joshua R.
307	Giddings, wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia with compensation for the owners, enforcement to capture fugitive slaves, and a popular vote on the matter.
307	He abandoned the bill when it failed to garner sufficient Whig supporters.
307	On foreign and military policy, Lincoln spoke out against the Mexican–American War, which he attributed to President Polk's desire for "military glory—that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood".
307	Lincoln also supported the Wilmot Proviso, which, if it had been adopted, would have banned slavery in any U.S.
307	Mexico.
307	Lincoln emphasized his opposition to Polk by drafting and introducing his Spot Resolutions.
307	The war had begun with a Mexican slaughter of American soldiers in territory disputed by Mexico and the U.S.; Polk insisted that Mexican soldiers had "invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our own soil".
307	Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil.
307	Congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it, the national papers ignored it, and it resulted in a loss of political support for Lincoln in his district.
307	One Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him "spotty Lincoln".
307	Lincoln later regretted some of his statements, especially his attack on the presidential war-making powers.
307	Realizing Clay was unlikely to win the presidency, Lincoln, who had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the House, supported General Zachary Taylor for the Whig nomination in the 1848 presidential election.
307	Taylor won and Lincoln hoped to be appointed Commissioner of the General Land Office, but that lucrative patronage job went to an Illinois rival, Justin Butterfield, considered by the administration to be a highly skilled lawyer, but in Lincoln's view, an "old fossil".
307	The administration offered him the consolation prize of secretary or governor of the Oregon Territory.
307	This distant territory was a Democratic stronghold, and acceptance of the post would have effectively ended his legal and political career in Illinois, so he declined and resumed his law practice.
307	Prairie lawyer Lincoln returned to practicing law in Springfield, handling "every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer".
307	Twice a year for 16 years, 10 weeks at a time, he appeared in county seats in the midstate regf> Twice a year for 16 years, 10 weeks ion when the county courts were in session.
307	Lincoln handled many transportation cases in the midst of the nation's western expansion, particularly the conflicts arising from the operation of river barges under the many new railroad bridges.
307	As a riverboat man, Lincoln initially favored those interests, but ultimately represented whoever hired him.
307	His reputation grew, and he appeared before the Supreme Court of the United States, arguing a case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge.
307	In 1849, he received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water.
307	The idea was never commercialized, but Lincoln is the only president to hold a patent.
307	In 1851, he represented the Alton & Sangamon Railroad in a dispute with one of its shareholders, James A.
307	Barret, who had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to buy shares in the railroad on the grounds that the company had changed its original train route.
307	Lincoln successfully argued that the railroad company was not bound by its original charter in existence at the time of Barret's pledge; the charter was amended in the public interest to provide a newer, superior, and less expensive route, and the corporation retained the right to demand Barret's payment.
307	The decision by the Illinois Supreme Court has been cited by numerous other courts in the nation.
307	Lincoln appeared before the Illinois Supreme Court in 175 cases, in 51 as sole counsel, of which 31 were decided in his favor.
307	From 1853 to 1860, another of Lincoln's largest clients was the Illinois Central Railroad.
307	Lincoln's most notable criminal trial occurred in 1858 when he defended William "Duff" Armstrong, who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker.
307	The case is famous for Lincoln's use of a fact established by judicial notice in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness.
307	After an opposing witness testified seeing the crime in the moonlight, Lincoln produced a Farmers' Almanac showing the moon was at a low angle, drastically reducing visibility.
307	Based on this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted.
307	Lincoln rarely raised objections in the courtroom; but in an 1859 case, where he defended a cousin, Peachy Harrison, who was accused of stabbing another to death, Lincoln angrily protested the judge's decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client.
307	Instead of holding Lincoln in contempt of court as was expected, the judge, a Democrat, reversed his ruling, allowing the evidence and acquitting Harrison.
307	Republican politics 1854–60 Slavery and a "House Divided" By the 1850s, slavery was still legal in the southern United States, but had been generally outlawed in the northern states, such as Illinois.
307	Lincoln disapproved of slavery, and the spread of slavery to new U.S.
307	He returned to politics to oppose the pro-slavery Kansas–Nebraska Act (1854); this law repealed the slavery-restricting Missouri Compromise (1820).
307	Senior Senator Stephen A.
307	Douglas of Illinois had incorporated popular sovereignty into the Act.
307	Douglas' provision, which Lincoln opposed, specified settlers had the right to determine locally whether to allow slavery in new U.S.
307	Congress.
307	Eric Foner (2010) contrasts the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast who saw slavery as a sin, with the conservative Republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress.
307	Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles of the Founding Fathers, especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the Declaration of Independence.
307	On October 16, 1854, in his "Peoria Speech", Lincoln declared his opposition to slavery, which he repeated en route to the presidency.
307	Speaking in his Kentucky accent, with a very powerful voice, he said the Kansas Act had a "declared indifference, but as I must think, a covert real zeal for the spread of slavery.
307	I cannot but hate it.
307	I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself.
307	I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world ..."
307	In late 1854, Lincoln ran as a Whig for the U.S.
307	Senate seat from Illinois.
307	At that time, senators were elected by the state legislature.
307	After leading in the first six rounds of voting in the Illinois assembly, his support began to dwindle, and Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for Lyman Trumbull, who defeated opponent Joel Aldrich Matteson.
307	The Whigs had been irreparably split by the Kansas–Nebraska Act.
307	Lincoln wrote, "I think I am a Whig, but others say there are no Whigs, and that I am an abolitionist, even though I do no more than oppose the extension of slavery."
307	Drawing on remna.co.uk |date= 2010-03-05|accessdatnts of the old Whig party, and on disenchanted Free Soil, Liberty, and Democratic Party members, he was instrumental in forging the shape of the new Republican Party.
307	At the 1856 Republican National Convention, Lincoln placed second in the contest to become the party's candidate for vice president.
307	In 1857–1858, Douglas broke with President James Buchanan, leading to a fight for control of the Democratic Party.
307	Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas for the Senate in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state.
307	In March 1857, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dred Scott v.
307	Sandford; Chief Justice Roger B.
307	Taney opined that blacks were not citizens, and derived no rights from the Constitution.
307	Lincoln denounced the decision, alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the Slave Power.
307	Lincoln argued, "The authors of the Declaration of Independence never intended 'to say all were equal in color, size, intellect, moral developments, or social capacity', but they 'did consider all men created equal—equal in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness'."
307	After the state Republican party convention nominated him for the U.S.
307	Senate in 1858, Lincoln delivered his House Divided Speech, drawing on : "A house divided against itself cannot stand.
307	I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free.
307	I do not expect the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided.
307	It will become all one thing, or all the other."
307	The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the North.
307	The stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the Illinois legislature which would, in turn, select Lincoln or Douglas as its U.S.
307	Lincoln–Douglas debates and Cooper Union speech The Senate campaign featured the seven Lincoln–Douglas debates of 1858, the most famous political debates in American history.
307	The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically.
307	Lincoln warned that "The Slave Power" was threatening the values of republicanism, and accused Douglas of distorting the values of the Founding Fathers that all men are created equal, while Douglas emphasized his Freeport Doctrine, that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not, and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists.
307	The debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands.
307	Lincoln stated Douglas' popular sovereignty theory was a threat to the nation's morality and that Douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states.
307	Douglas said that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S.
307	Supreme Court and the Dred Scott decision.
307	Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas to the Senate.
307	Despite the bitterness of the defeat for Lincoln, his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation.
307	In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the Illinois Staats-Anzeiger, a German-language newspaper which was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 German Americans voted Democratic but there was Republican support that a German-language paper could mobilize.
307	On February 27, 1860, New York party leaders invited Lincoln to give a speech at Cooper Union to a group of powerful Republicans.
307	Lincoln argued that the Founding Fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery.
307	Lincoln insisted the moral foundation of the Republicans required opposition to slavery, and rejected any "groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong".
307	Despite his inelegant appearance—many in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly—Lincoln demonstrated an intellectual leadership that brought him into the front ranks of the party and into contention for the Republican presidential nomination.
307	Journalist Noah Brooks reported, "No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience."
307	Historian Donald described the speech as a "superb political move for an unannounced candidate, to appear in one rival's (William H.
307	Seward) own state at an event sponsored by the second rival's (Salmon P.
307	Chase) loyalists, while not mentioning either by name during its delivery."
307	In response to an inquiry about his presidential intentions, Lincoln said, "The taste is in my mouth a little."
307	Presidential nomination and campaign On May 9–10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur.
307	Lincoln's followers organized a campaign team led by David Davis, Norman Judd, Leonard Swett, and Jesse DuBois, and Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency.
307	Exploiting the embellished legend of his frontier days with his father, Lincoln's supporters adopted the label of "The Rail Candidate".
307	On May 18, at the Republican National Convention in Chicago, Lincoln's friends promised and manipulated and won the nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as William H.
307	Seward and Salmon P.
307	Chase.
307	A former Democrat, Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, was nominated for Vice President to balance the ticket.
307	Lincoln's success depended on his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for Whiggish programs of internal improvements and the protective tariff.
307	On the third ballot Pennsylvania put him over the top.
307	Pennsylvania iron interests were reassured by his support for protective tariffs.
307	Lincoln's managers had been adroitly focused on this delegation as well as thep.
307	Lincoln's managers had been  others, while following Lincoln's strong dictate to "Make no contracts that bind me".
307	Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party, as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government with the Dred Scott decision and the presidency of James Buchanan.
307	Throughout the 1850s, Lincoln doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession.
307	Meanwhile, Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats.
307	Delegates from 11 slave states walked out of the Democratic convention, disagreeing with Douglas' position on popular sovereignty, and ultimately selected John C.
307	Breckinridge as their candidate.
307	As Douglas and the other candidates went through with their campaigns, Lincoln was the only one of them who gave no speeches.
307	Instead, he monitored the campaign closely and relied on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party.
307	The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North, and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials.
307	There were thousands of Republican speakers who focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty.
307	The goal was to demonstrate the superior power of "free labor", whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts.
307	The Republican Party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a Chicago Tribune writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln's life, and sold 100,000 to 200,000 copies.
307	Presidency 1860 election and secession On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected the 16th president of the United States, beating Democrat Stephen A.
307	Douglas, John C.
307	Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats, and John Bell of the new Constitutional Union Party.
307	He was the first president from the Republican Party.
307	Winning entirely on the strength of his support in the North and West, no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states, and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states.
307	Lincoln received 1,866,452 votes, Douglas 1,376,957 votes, Breckinridge 849,781 votes, and Bell 588,789 votes.
307	Turnout was 82.2 percent, with Lincoln winning the free Northern states, as well as California and Oregon.
307	Douglas won Missouri, and split New Jersey with Lincoln.
307	Bell won Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky, and Breckinridge won the rest of the South.
307	Although Lincoln won only a plurality of the popular vote, his victory in the electoral college was decisive: Lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123.
307	There were fusion tickets in which all of Lincoln's opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, but even if the anti-Lincoln vote had been combined in every state, Lincoln still would have won a majority in the Electoral College.
307	As Lincoln's election became evident, secessionists made clear their intent to leave the Union before he took office the next March.
307	On December 20, 1860, South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by February 1, 1861, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed.
307	Six of these states then adopted a constitution and declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the Confederate States of America.
307	The upper South and border states (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) listened to, but initially rejected, the secessionist appeal.
307	President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy, declaring secession illegal.
307	The Confederacy selected Jefferson Davis as its provisional President on February 9, 1861.
307	There were attempts at compromise.
307	The Crittenden Compromise would have extended the Missouri Compromise line of 1820, dividing the territories into slave and free, contrary to the Republican Party's free-soil platform.
307	Lincoln rejected the idea, saying, "I will suffer death before I consent ...
307	" Lincoln, however, did tacitly support the proposed Corwin Amendment to the Constitution, which passed Congress before Lincoln came into office and was then awaiting ratification by the states.
307	That proposed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed and would have guaranteed that Congress would not interfere with slavery without Southern consent.
307	A few weeks before the war, Lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them Congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the Constitution.
307	Lincoln was open to the possibility of a constitutional convention to make further amendments to the Constitution.
307	En route to his inauguration by train, Lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the North.
307	The president-elect then evaded possible assassins in Baltimore, who were uncovered by Lincoln's head of security, Allan Pinkerton.
307	On February 23, 1861, he arrived in disguise in Washington, D.C., which was placed under substantial military guard.
307	Lincoln directed his inaugural address to the South, proclaiming once again that he had no intention, or inclination, to abolish slavery in the Southern states: The President ended his address with an appeal to the people of the South: "We are not enemies, but friends.
307	We must not be enemies ...
307	The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature."
307	The failure of the Peace Conference of 1861 signaled that legislative compromise was implausible.
307	By March 1861, no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the Union on any terms.
307	Meanwhile, Lincoln and nearly every Republican leader agreed that the dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated.
307	Beginning of the war The commander of Fort Sumter, South Carolina, Major Robert Anderson, sent a request for provisions to Washington, and the execution of Lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war.
307	On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops at Fort Sumter, forcing them to surrender, and began the war.
307	Historian Allan Nevins argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and not realizing the Southern Unionists were insisting there be no invasion.
307	William Tecumseh Sherman talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was "sadly disappointed" at his failure to realize that "the country was sleeping on a volcano" and that the South was preparing for war.
307	Donald concludes that, "His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Ft.
307	Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood.
307	But he also vowed not to surrender the forts.
307	The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot; they did just that."
307	On April 15, Lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect Washington, and "preserve the Union", which, in his view, still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states.
307	This call forced the states to choose sides.
307	Virginia declared its secession and was rewarded with the Confederate capital, despite the exposed position of Richmond so close to Union lines.
307	North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months.
307	Secession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland, but did not prevail; Kentucky tried to be neutral.
307	Troops headed south towards Washington to protect the capital in response to Lincoln's call.
307	On April 19, secessionist mobs in Baltimore that controlled the rail links attacked Union troops traveling to the capital.
307	George William Brown, the Mayor of Baltimore, and other suspected Maryland politicians were arrested and imprisoned, without a warrant, as Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus.
307	John Merryman, a leader in the secessionist group in Maryland, petitioned Chief Justice Roger B.
307	Taney to issue a writ of habeas corpus, saying holding Merryman without a hearing was unlawful.
307	Taney issued the writ, thereby ordering Merryman's release, but Lincoln ignored it.
307	Then and throughout the war, Lincoln came under heavy, often vituperative attack from antiwar Democrats, called Copperheads.
307	Assuming command for the Union in the war After the fall of Fort Sumter, Lincoln realized the importance of taking immediate executive control of the war and making an overall strategy to put down the rebellion.
307	Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis, and he responded as commander-in-chief, using unprecedented powers.
307	He expanded his war powers, and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, and after suspending habeas corpus, arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers.
307	Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions.
307	In addition, Lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict.
307	The war effort was the source of continued disparagement of Lincoln, and dominated his time and attention.
307	From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort, and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army.
307	Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue.
307	Conversely, the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery.
307	On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort.
307	In practice the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy In late August 1861, General John C.
307	Frémont, the 1856 Republican presidential nominee, issued, without consulting Washington, a proclamation of martial law in Missouri.
307	He declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be court-martialed and shot, and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed.
307	Frémont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the Department of the West compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption.
307	Lincoln overruled Frémont's proclamation.
307	Lincoln believed that Fremont's emancipation was political; neither militarily necessary nor legal.
307	Union enlistments from Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri increased by over 40,000 troops.
307	The Trent Affa increased by over 40,000 troir of late 1861 threatened war with Great Britain.
307	The U.S.
307	Navy illegally intercepted a British merchant ship, the Trent, on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys; Britain protested vehemently while the U.S.
307	Lincoln resolved the issue by releasing the two men and war was successfully averted with Britain.
307	Lincoln's foreign policy approach had been initially hands off, due to his inexperience; he left most diplomacy appointments and other foreign policy matters to his Secretary of State, William Seward.
307	Seward's initial reaction to the Trent affair, however, was too bellicose, so Lincoln also turned to Senator Charles Sumner, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and an expert in British diplomacy.
307	To learn technical military terms, Lincoln borrowed and studied Henry Halleck's book, Elements of Military Art and Science from the Library of Congress.
307	Lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraphic reports coming into the War Department in Washington, D.C.
307	He kept close tabs on all phases of the military effort, consulted with governors, and selected generals based on their past success (as well as their state and party).
307	In January 1862, after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department, Lincoln replaced Simon Cameron with Edwin Stanton as War Secretary.
307	Stanton was one of many conservative Democrats (he supported Breckenridge in the 1860 election) who became anti-slavery Republicans under Lincoln's leadership.
307	In terms of war strategy, Lincoln articulated two priorities: to ensure that Washington was well-defended, and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the North for prompt, decisive victory; major Northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days.
307	Twice a week, Lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon, and occasionally Mary Lincoln would force him to take a carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard.
307	Lincoln learned from his chief of staff General Henry Halleck, a student of the European strategist Jomini, of the critical need to control strategic points, such as the Mississippi River; he also knew well the importance of Vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing territory.
307	General McClellan After the Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run and the retirement of the aged Winfield Scott in late 1861, Lincoln appointed Major General George B.
307	McClellan general-in-chief of all the Union armies.
307	McClellan, a young West Point graduate, railroad executive, and Pennsylvania Democrat, took several months to plan and attempt his Peninsula Campaign, longer than Lincoln wanted.
307	The campaign's objective was to capture Richmond by moving the Army of the Potomac by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the Confederate capital.
307	McClellan's repeated delays frustrated Lincoln and Congress, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington.
307	Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops in defense of the capital; McClellan, who consistently overestimated the strength of Confederate troops, blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.
307	Lincoln removed McClellan as general-in-chief and appointed Henry Wager Halleck in March 1862, after McClellan's "Harrison's Landing Letter", in which he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort.
307	McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint John Pope, a Republican, as head of the new Army of Virginia.
307	Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack.
307	However, lacking requested reinforcements from McClellan, now commanding the Army of the Potomac, Pope was soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time.
307	The war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the CSS Virginia, formerly the USS Merrimack, damaged or destroyed three Union vessels in Norfolk, Virginia, before being engaged and damaged by the USS Monitor.
307	Lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the Battle of Hampton Roads.
307	Despite his dissatisfaction with McClellan's failure to reinforce Pope, Lincoln was desperate, and restored him to command of all forces around Washington, to the dismay of all in his cabinet but Seward.
307	Two days after McClellan's return to command, General Robert E.
307	Lee's forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland, leading to the Battle of Antietam in September 1862.
307	The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history, but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January.
307	Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier, Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation.
307	McClellan then resisted the President's demand that he pursue Lee's retreating and exposed army, while his counterpart General Don Carlos Buell likewise refused orders to move the Army of the Ohio against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee.
307	As a result, Lincoln replaced Buell with William Rosecrans; and, after the 1862 midterm elections, he replaced McClellan with Republican Ambrose Burnside.
307	Both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the Commander-in-Chief.
307	Burnside, against the advice of the president, prematurely launched an offensive across the Rappahannock River and was stunningly defeated by Lee at Fredericksburg in December.
307	Not only had Burnside been defeated on the battlefield, but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined.
307	Desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after Fredericksburg.
307	Lincoln brought in Joseph Hooker, despite his record of loose talk about the need for a military dictatorship.
307	The mid-term elections in 1862 brought the Republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war, as well as rising inflation, new high taxes, rumors of corruption, the suspension of habeas corpus, the military draft law, and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market.
307	The Emancipation Proclamation announced in September gained votes for the Repubne the labor market.
307	The Emancipatlicans in the rural areas of New England and the upper Midwest, but it lost votes in the cities and the lower Midwest.
307	While Republicans were discouraged, Democrats were energized and did especially well in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and New York.
307	The Republicans did maintain their majorities in Congress and in the major states, except New York.
307	The Cincinnati Gazette contended that the voters were "depressed by the interminable nature of this war, as so far conducted, and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress".
307	In the spring of 1863, Lincoln was optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together; these plans included Hooker's attack on Lee north of Richmond, Rosecrans' on Chattanooga, Grant's on Vicksburg, and a naval assault on Charleston.
307	Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May, but continued to command his troops for some weeks.
307	He ignored Lincoln's order to divide his troops, and possibly force Lee to do the same in Harper's Ferry, and tendered his resignation, which Lincoln accepted.
307	He was replaced by George Meade, who followed Lee into Pennsylvania for the Gettysburg Campaign, which was a victory for the Union, though Lee's army avoided capture.
307	At the same time, after initial setbacks, Grant laid siege to Vicksburg and the Union navy attained some success in Charleston harbor.
307	After the Battle of Gettysburg, Lincoln clearly understood that his military decisions would be more effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his War Secretary or his general-in-chief on to his generals, who resented his civilian interference with their own plans.
307	Even so, he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as Commander-in-Chief.
307	Emancipation Proclamation Lincoln understood that the Federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution, which before 1865, committed the issue to individual states.
307	He argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new U.S.
307	At the beginning of the war, he also sought to persuade the states to accept compensated emancipation in return for their prohibition of slavery.
307	Lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it, as envisioned by the Founding Fathers, under the constitution.
307	President Lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by Major General John C.
307	Frémont in August 1861 and by Major General David Hunter in May 1862, on the grounds that it was not within their power, and it would upset the border states loyal to the Union.
307	On June 19, 1862, endorsed by Lincoln, Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory.
307	In July 1862, the Second Confiscation Act was passed, which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion.
307	Although Lincoln believed it was not within Congress's power to free the slaves within the states, he approved the bill in deference to the legislature.
307	He felt such action could only be taken by the Commander-in-Chief using war powers granted to the president by the Constitution, and Lincoln was planning to take that action.
307	In that month, Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet.
307	In it, he stated that "as a fit and necessary military measure, on January 1, 1863, all persons held as slaves in the Confederate states will thenceforward, and forever, be free."
307	Privately, Lincoln concluded at this point that the slave base of the Confederacy had to be eliminated.
307	However Copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification.
307	Republican editor Horace Greeley of the highly influential New York Tribune fell for the ploy, and Lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of August 22, 1862.
307	The President said the primary goal of his actions as president (he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his "official duty") was preserving the Union: The Emancipation Proclamation, issued on September 22, 1862, and put into effect on January 1, 1863, declared free the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control, with exemptions specified for areas already under Union control in two states.
307	Lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation, while Democrats rallied their voters in the 1862 off-year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites.
307	Once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective, as Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in Confederate territory were freed.
307	Lincoln's comment on the signing of the Proclamation was: "I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper."
307	For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves.
307	He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed.
307	A few days after Emancipation was announced, 13 Republican governors met at the War Governors' Conference; they supported the president's Proclamation, but suggested the removal of General George B.
307	McClellan as commander of the Union Army.
307	Using former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation.
307	By the spring of 1863, he was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers.
307	In a letter to Andrew Johnson, th was ready to recruit blace military governor of Tennessee, encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, Lincoln wrote, "The bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once".
307	By the end of 1863, at Lincoln's direction, General Lorenzo Thomas had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley.
307	Frederick Douglass once observed of Lincoln: "In his company, I was never reminded of my humble origin, or of my unpopular color".
307	Gettysburg Address With the great Union victory at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, and the defeat of the Copperheads in the Ohio election in the fall, Lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort, despite the New York City draft riots.
307	The stage was set for his address at the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery.
307	Defying Lincoln's prediction that "the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here," the Address became the most quoted speech in American history.
307	The Gettysburg Address was delivered at the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on the afternoon of Thursday, November 19, 1863.
307	In 272 words, and three minutes, Lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 1789, but in 1776, "conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."
307	He defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all.
307	The emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort.
307	He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end as a result of the losses, and the future of democracy would be assured, that "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."
307	Lincoln concluded that the Civil War had a profound objective: a new birth of freedom in the nation.
307	General Grant Meade's failure to capture Lee's army as it retreated from Gettysburg, and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac, persuaded Lincoln that a change in command was needed.
307	General Ulysses S.
307	Grant's victories at the Battle of Shiloh and in the Vicksburg campaign impressed Lincoln and made Grant a strong candidate to head the Union Army.
307	Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh, Lincoln had said, "I can't spare this man.
307	He fights."
307	With Grant in command, Lincoln felt the Union Army could relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters, and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops.
307	Nevertheless, Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a candidacy for President in 1864, as McClellan was.
307	Lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into Grant's political intentions, and being assured that he had none, submitted to the Senate Grant's promotion to commander of the Union Army.
307	He obtained Congress's consent to reinstate for Grant the rank of Lieutenant General, which no officer had held since George Washington.
307	Grant waged his bloody Overland Campaign in 1864.
307	This is often characterized as a war of attrition, given high Union losses at battles such as the Battle of the Wilderness and Cold Harbor.
307	Even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive, the Confederate forces had "almost as high a percentage of casualties as the Union forces".
307	The high casualty figures of the Union alarmed the North; Grant had lost a third of his army, and Lincoln asked what Grant's plans were, to which the general replied, "I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer."
307	The Confederacy lacked reinforcements, so Lee's army shrank with every costly battle.
307	Grant's army moved south, crossed the James River, forcing a siege and trench warfare outside Petersburg, Virginia.
307	Lincoln then made an extended visit to Grant's headquarters at City Point, Virginia.
307	This allowed the president to confer in person with Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman about the hostilities, as Sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to Grant from his position in North Carolina.
307	Lincoln and the Republican Party mobilized support for the draft throughout the North, and replaced his losses.
307	Lincoln authorized Grant to target the Confederate infrastructure—such as plantations, railroads, and bridges—hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting.
307	Grant's move to Petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between Richmond and the South.
307	This strategy allowed Generals Sherman and Philip Sheridan to destroy plantations and towns in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley.
307	The damage caused by Sherman's March to the Sea through Georgia in 1864 was limited to a 60 mi swath, but neither Lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal, but rather defeat of the Confederate armies.
307	As Neely (2004) concludes, there was no effort to engage in "total war" against civilians, as in World War II.
307	Confederate general Jubal Anderson Early began a series of assaults in the North that threatened the Capital.
307	During Early's raid on Washington, D.C.
307	Lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position; Captain Oliver Wendell Holmes shouted at him, "Get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!"
307	After repeated calls on Grant to defend Washington, Sheridan was appointed and the threat from Early was dispatched.
307	As Grant continued to wear down Lee's forces, efforts to discuss peace began.
307	Confederate Vice President Stephens led a group to meet with Lincoln, Seward, and others at Hampton Roads.
307	Lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the Confederacy as a coequal; his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results.
307	On April 1, 1865, Grant successfully outflanked Lee's forces in the Battle of Five Forks and nearly encircled Petersburg, and the Confederate government evacuated Richmond.
307	Days later, when that city fell, Lincoln visited the vanquished Confederate capital; as he walked through the city, white Southerners were stone-fad the vanquished Confederate capced, but freedmen greeted him as a hero.
307	On April 9, Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox and the war was effectively over.
307	Lincoln was a master politician, bringing together—and holding together—all the main factions of the Republican Party, and bringing in War Democrats such as Edwin M.
307	Stanton and Andrew Johnson as well.
307	Lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers—greatly expanded over peacetime—to hold the factions of his party together, build support for his own policies, and fend off efforts by Radicals to drop him from the 1864 ticket.
307	At its 1864 convention, the Republican Party selected Andrew Johnson, a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate.
307	To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans, Lincoln ran under the label of the new Union Party.
307	When Grant's 1864 spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates and Union casualties mounted, the lack of military success wore heavily on the President's re-election prospects, and many Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated.
307	Sharing this fear, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that, if he should lose the election, he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House:  Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.
307	While the Democratic platform followed the "Peace wing" of the party and called the war a "failure", their candidate, General George B.
307	McClellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform.
307	Lincoln provided Grant with more troops and mobilized his party to renew its support of Grant in the war effort.
307	Sherman's capture of Atlanta in September and David Farragut's capture of Mobile ended defeatist jitters; the Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln.
307	By contrast, the National Union Party was united and energized as Lincoln made emancipation the central issue, and state Republican parties stressed the perfidy of the Copperheads.
307	Lincoln was re-elected in a landslide, carrying all but three states, and receiving 78 percent of the Union soldiers' vote.
307	On March 4, 1865, Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address.
307	In it, he deemed the high casualties on both sides to be God's will.
307	Historian Mark Noll concludes it ranks "among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which Americans conceive their place in the world".
307	Lincoln said: Reconstruction Reconstruction began during the war, as Lincoln and his associates anticipated questions of how to reintegrate the conquered southern states, and how to determine the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves.
307	Shortly after Lee's surrender, a general had asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, and Lincoln replied, "Let 'em up easy."
307	In keeping with that sentiment, Lincoln led the moderates regarding Reconstruction policy, and was opposed by the Radical Republicans, under Rep.
307	Thaddeus Stevens, Sen.
307	Charles Sumner and Sen.
307	Benjamin Wade, political allies of the president on other issues.
307	Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war.
307	His Amnesty Proclamation of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.
307	As Southern states were subdued, critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re-formed.
307	Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas, where Lincoln appointed Generals Andrew Johnson and Frederick Steele as military governors, respectively.
307	In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General Nathaniel P.
307	Banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it.
307	Lincoln's Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations.
307	On the other hand, the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the Wade-Davis Bill, in 1864.
307	When Lincoln vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.
307	Lincoln's appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and Radical factions in harness.
307	To fill Chief Justice Taney's seat on the Supreme Court, he named the choice of the Radicals, Salmon P.
307	Chase, who Lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies.
307	After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation, which did not apply to every state, Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with a constitutional amendment.
307	Lincoln declared that such an amendment would "clinch the whole matter".
307	By December 1863 a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery absolutely was brought to Congress for passage.
307	This first attempt at an amendment failed to pass, falling short of the required two-thirds majority on June 15, 1864, in the House of Representatives.
307	Passage of the proposed amendment became part of the Republican/Unionist platform in the election of 1864.
307	After a long debate in the House, a second attempt passed Congress on January 31, 1865, and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification.
307	Upon ratification, it became the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution on December 6, 1865.
307	As the war drew to a close, Lincoln's presidential Reconstruction for the South was in flux; having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen.
307	He signed into law Senator Charles Sumner's Freedman's Bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves.
307	The law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen.
307	Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction.
307	Shortly before his assassination, Lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern Reconstruction.
307	Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states, until readmission under the control of southern Unionists.
307	Redefining the republic and republicanism The successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country.
307	The term "the United States" has historically been used, sometimes in the plural ("these United States"), and other times in the singular, without any particular grammatical consistency.
307	The Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century.
307	In recent years, historians such as Harry Jaffa, Herman Belz, John Diggins, Vernon Burton and Eric Foner have stressed Lincoln's redefinition of republican values.
307	As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution, Lincoln redirected emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values—what he called the "sheet anchor" of republicanism.
307	The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, in contrast to the Constitution's tolerance of slavery, shifted the debate.
307	As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech of early 1860, "Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself."
307	His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms.
307	Nevertheless, in 1861, Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state.
307	Burton (2008) argues that Lincoln's republicanism was taken up by the Freedmen as they were emancipated.
307	In March 1861, in his First Inaugural Address, Lincoln explored the nature of democracy.
307	He denounced secession as anarchy, and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the American system.
307	He said "A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people."
307	Other enactments Lincoln adhered to the Whig theory of the presidency, which gave Congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them.
307	Lincoln only vetoed four bills passed by Congress; the only important one was the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh program of Reconstruction.
307	He signed the Homestead Act in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost.
307	The Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state.
307	The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' First Transcontinental Railroad, which was completed in 1869.
307	The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was made possible by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.
307	Other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), and a new Federal income tax.
307	In 1861, Lincoln signed the second and third Morrill Tariff, the first having become law under James Buchanan.
307	Also in 1861, Lincoln signed the Revenue Act of 1861, creating the first U.S.
307	This created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 ($ in current dollar terms), which was later changed by the Revenue Act of 1862 to a progressive rate structure.
307	Lincoln also presided over the expansion of the federal government's economic influence in several other areas.
307	The creation of the system of national banks by the National Banking Act provided a strong financial network in the country.
307	It also established a national currency.
307	In 1862, Congress created, with Lincoln's approval, the Department of Agriculture.
307	In 1862, Lincoln sent a senior general, John Pope, to put down the "Sioux Uprising" in Minnesota.
307	Presented with 303 execution warrants for convicted Santee Dakota who were accused of killing innocent farmers, Lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants, eventually approving 39 for execution (one was later reprieved).
307	President Lincoln had planned to reform federal Indian policy.
307	In the wake of Grant's casualties in his campaign against Lee, Lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft, but it was never issued.
307	In response to rumors of one, however, the editors of the New York World and the Journal of Commerce published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market.
307	Lincoln's reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior; he ordered the military to seize the two papers.
307	The seizure lasted for two days.
307	Lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States.
307	Before Lincoln's presidency, Thanksgiving, while a regional holiday in New England since the 17th century, had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates.
307	The last such proclamation had been during James Madison's presidency 50 years before.
307	In 1863, Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving.
307	In June 1864, Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress, which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as Yosemite National Park.
307	Judicial appointments Supreme Court appointments * Noah Haynes Swayne – 1862 * Samuel Freeman Miller – 1862 * David Davis – 1862 * Stephen Johnson Field – 1863 * Salmon Portland Chase – 1864 (Chief Justice) Lincoln's declared philosophy on court nominations was that "we cannot ask a man what he will do, and if we should, and he should answer us, we should despise him for it.
307	Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known."
307	Lincoln made five appointments to the United States Supreme Court.
307	Noah Haynes Swayne, nominated January 21, 1862 and appointed January 24, 1862, was chosen as an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union.
307	Samuel Freeman Miller, nominated and appointed on July 16, 1862, supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist.
307	David Davis, Lincoln's campaign manager in 1860, nominated December 1, 1862 and appointed December 8, 1862, had also served as a judge in Lincoln's Illinois court circuit.
307	Stephen Johnson Field, a previous California Supreme Court justice, was nominated March 6, 1863 and appointed March 10, 1863, and provided geographic balance, as well as political balance to the court as a Democrat.
307	Finally, Lincoln's Treasury Secretary, Salmon P.
307	Chase, was nominated as Chief Justice, and appointed the same day, on December 6, 1864.
307	Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist, would support Reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the Republican Party.
307	Other judicial appointments Lincoln appointed 32 federal judges, including four Associate Justices and one Chief Justice to the Supreme Court of the United States, and 27 judges to the United States district courts.
307	Lincoln appointed no judges to the United States circuit courts during his time in office.
307	States admitted to the Union West Virginia, admitted to the Union June 20, 1863, contained the former north-westernmost counties of Virginia that seceded from Virginia after that commonwealth declared its secession from the Union.
307	As a condition for its admission, West Virginia's constitution was required to provide for the gradual abolition of slavery.
307	Nevada, which became the third State in the far-west of the continent, was admitted as a free state on October 31, 1864.
307	Assassination John Wilkes Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service.
307	In 1864, Booth formulated a plan (very similar to one of Thomas N.
307	Conrad previously authorized by the Confederacy) to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners.
307	After attending an April 11, 1865, speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and became determined to assassinate the president.
307	Learning that the President, First Lady, and head Union general Ulysses S.
307	Grant would be attending Ford's Theatre, Booth formulated a plan with co-conspirators to assassinate Vice President Andrew Johnson, Secretary of State William H.
307	Seward and General Grant.
307	Without his main bodyguard, Ward Hill Lamon, Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14.
307	Grant along with his wife chose at the last minute to travel to Philadelphia instead of attending the play.
307	Lincoln's bodyguard, John Parker, left Ford's Theater during intermission to join Lincoln's coagt; Lincoln's bodyguard, John Pchman for drinks in the Star Saloon next door.
307	The now unguarded President sat in his state box in the balcony.
307	Seizing the opportunity, Booth crept up from behind and at about 10:13 pm, aimed at the back of Lincoln's head and fired at point-blank range, mortally wounding the President.
307	Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped.
307	After being on the run for 10 days, Booth was tracked down and found on a farm in Virginia, some 70 mi south of Washington, D.C.
307	After a brief fight with Union troops, Booth was killed by Sergeant Boston Corbett on April 26.
307	An Army surgeon, Doctor Charles Leale, was sitting nearby at the theater and immediately assisted the President.
307	He found the President unresponsive, barely breathing and with no detectable pulse.
307	Having determined that the President had been shot in the head, and not stabbed in the shoulder as originally thought, he made an attempt to clear the blood clot, after which the President began to breathe more naturally.
307	The dying man was taken across the street to Petersen House.
307	After being in a coma for nine hours, Lincoln died at 7:22 am on April 15.
307	Presbyterian minister Phineas Densmore Gurley, then present, was asked to offer a prayer, after which Secretary of War Stanton saluted and said, "Now he belongs to the ages."
307	Lincoln's flag-enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the White House by bareheaded Union officers, while the city's church bells rang.
307	President Johnson was sworn in at 10:00 am, less than 3 hours after Lincoln's death.
307	The late President lay in state in the East Room, and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21.
307	For his final journey with his son Willie, both caskets were transported in the executive coach "United States" and for three weeks the Lincoln Special funeral train decorated in black bunting bore Lincoln's remains on a slow circuitous waypoint journey from Washington D.C.
307	Springfield, Illinois stopping at many cities across the North for large-scale memorials attended by hundreds of thousands, as well as many people who gathered in informal trackside tributes with bands, bonfires and hymn singing or silent reverence with hat in hand as the railway procession slowly passed by.
307	Religious and philosophical beliefs As a young man, Lincoln was clearly a religious skeptic, or, in the words of a biographer, even an iconoclast.
307	Later in life, Lincoln's frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences, who were mostly evangelical Protestants.
307	He never joined a church, although he frequently attended with his wife, but he was deeply familiar with the Bible, quoted it and praised it.
307	In the 1840s Lincoln subscribed to the Doctrine of Necessity, a belief that asserted the human mind was controlled by some higher power.
307	In the 1850s, Lincoln acknowledged "providence" in a general way, and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals; he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence.
307	When he suffered the death of his son Edward, Lincoln more frequently acknowledged his own need to depend on God.
307	The death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look toward religion for answers and solace.
307	After Willie's death, Lincoln considered why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary.
307	He wrote at this time that God "could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest.
307	Yet the contest began.
307	And having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day.
307	Yet the contest proceeds."
307	On the day Lincoln was assassinated, he reportedly told his wife Mary at Ford's Theatre he desired to visit the Holy Land.
307	Historical reputation In surveys of scholars ranking Presidents since the 1940s, Lincoln is consistently ranked in the top three, often #1.
307	A 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked Lincoln number one, while legal scholars placed him second after Washington.
307	Of all the presidential ranking polls conducted since 1948, Lincoln has been rated at the very top in the majority of polls: Schlesinger 1948, Schlesinger 1962, 1982 Murray Blessing Survey, Chicago Tribune 1982 poll, Schlesinger 1996, CSPAN 1996, Ridings-McIver 1996, Time 2008, and CSPAN 2009.
307	Generally, the top three presidents are rated as 1) Lincoln; 2) George Washington; and 3) Franklin D.
307	Roosevelt, although Lincoln and Washington, and Washington and Roosevelt, occasionally are reversed.
307	President Lincoln's assassination made him a national martyr and endowed him with a recognition of mythic proportion.
307	Lincoln was viewed by abolitionists as a champion for human liberty.
307	Republicans linked Lincoln's name to their party.
307	Many, though not all, in the South considered Lincoln as a man of outstanding ability.
307	Schwartz argues that Lincoln's reputation grew slowly in the late 19th century until the Progressive Era (1900–1920s) when he emerged as one of the most venerated heroes in American history, with even white Southerners in agreement.
307	The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial on the Mall in Washington.
307	In the New Deal era liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who doubtless would have supported the welfare state.
307	In the Cold War years, Lincoln's image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes.
307	By the 1970s Lincoln had become a hero to political conservatives for his intense nationalism, support for business, his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage, his acting in terms of Lockean and Burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition, and his devotion to the principles of the Founding Fathers.
307	As a Whig activist, Lincoln was a spokesman for business interests, favoring high tariffs, banks, internal improvements, and railroads in opposition to the agrarian Democrats.
307	William C.
307	Harris found that Lincoln's "reverence for the Founding Fathers, the Constitution, the laws under it, and the preservation of the Republic and its institutions undergirded and strengthened his conservatism.".
307	James G.
307	Randall emphasizes his tolerance and especially his moderation "in his preference for orderly progress, his distrust of dangerous agitation, and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform."
307	Randall concludes that, "he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called 'radicalism' which involved abuse of the South, hatred for the slaveholder, thirst for vengeance, partisan plotting, and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders."
307	By the late 1960s, liberals, such as historian Lerone Bennett, were having second thoughts, especially regarding Lincoln's views on racial issues.
307	Bennett won wide attention when he called Lincoln a white supremacist in 1968.
307	He noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs, told jokes that ridiculed blacks, insisted he opposed social equality, and proposed sending freed slaves to another country.
307	Defenders, such as authors Dirck and Cashin, retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians; and that he was a "moral visionary" who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause, as fast as politically possible.
307	The emphasis shifted away from Lincoln-the-emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery, or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation.
307	Historian Barry Schwartz wrote in 2009 that Lincoln's image suffered "erosion, fading prestige, benign ridicule," in the late 20th century.
307	On the other hand, Donald opined in his 1996 biography that Lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability, defined by the poet John Keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were "content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts, and not compelled toward fact or reason."
307	Memorials Lincoln appears on the penny and the $5 bill, and on many postage stamps.
307	He has been memorialized in many town, city, and county names, including the capital of Nebraska.
307	The most famous and most visited memorials are the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.; Lincoln's sculpture on Mount Rushmore; Ford's Theatre and Petersen House (where he died) in Washington and the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, located in Springfield, Illinois, not far from Lincoln's Tomb.
307	Barry Schwartz, a sociologist who has examined America's cultural memory, argues that in the 1930s and 1940s, the memory of Abraham Lincoln  was practically sacred and provided the nation with "a moral symbol inspiring and guiding American life."
307	During the Great Depression, he argues,  Lincoln served "as a means for seeing the world's disappointments, for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful."
307	Franklin D.
307	Roosevelt, preparing America for war, used the words of the Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by  Germany and Japan.
307	Americans asked, "What would Lincoln do?"
307	However, he also finds that since World War II, Lincoln's symbolic power has lost relevance, and this "fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness."
307	He suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept.
308	Aristotle (, Aristotélēs) (384 BC – 322 BC) was a Greek philosopher and polymath, a student of Plato and teacher of Alexander the Great.
308	His writings cover many subjects, including physics, metaphysics, poetry, theater, music, logic, rhetoric, linguistics, politics, government, ethics, biology, and zoology.
308	Together with Plato and Socrates (Plato's teacher), Aristotle is one of the most important founding figures in Western philosophy.
308	Aristotle's writings were the first to create a comprehensive system of Western philosophy, encompassing morality, aesthetics, logic, science, politics, and metaphysics.
308	Aristotle's views on the physical sciences profoundly shaped medieval scholarship, and their influence extended well into the Renaissance, although they were ultimately replaced by Newtonian physics.
308	In the zoological sciences, some of his observations were confirmed to be accurate only in the 19th century.
308	His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, which was incorporated in the late 19th century into modern formal logic.
308	In metaphysics, Aristotelianism had a profound influence on philosophical and theological thinking in the Islamic and Jewish traditions in the Middle Ages, and it continues to influence Christian theology, especially the scholastic tradition of the Catholic Church.
308	Aristotle was well known among medieval Muslim intellectuals and revered as  المعلم الأول - "The First Teacher".
308	His ethics, though always influential, gained reneweالمعلم الأول - "The First Teacher".
308	Hid interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics.
308	All aspects of Aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today.
308	Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues (Cicero described his literary style as "a river of gold"), it is thought that the majority of his writings are now lost and only about one-third of the original works have survived.
308	Life Aristotle, whose name means "the best purpose," was born in Stagira, Chalcidice, in 384 BC, about 55 km east of modern-day Thessaloniki.
308	His father Nicomachus was the personal physician to King Amyntas of Macedon.
308	Although there is little information on Aristotle' childhood, he probably did spend some time then in the Macedonian palace, making his first connections with the Macedonian monarchy.
308	At about the age of eighteen, he went to Athens to continue his education at Plato's Academy.
308	Aristotle remained at the academy for nearly twenty years before leaving Athens in 348/47 BC.
308	The traditional story about his departure reports that he was disappointed with the direction the academy took after control passed to Plato's nephew Speusippus upon his death, although it is possible that he feared anti-Macedonian sentiments and left before Plato had died.
308	He then traveled with Xenocrates to the court of his friend Hermias of Atarneus in Asia Minor.
308	While in Asia, Aristotle traveled with Theophrastus to the island of Lesbos, where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island.
308	Aristotle married Hermias's adoptive daughter (or niece) Pythias.
308	She bore him a daughter, whom they named Pythias.
308	Soon after Hermias' death, Aristotle was invited by Philip II of Macedon to become the tutor to his son Alexander in 343 BC.
308	Aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of Macedon.
308	During that time he gave lessons not only to Alexander, but also to two other future kings: Ptolemy and Cassander.
308	Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest, and his attitude towards Persia was unabashedly ethnocentric.
308	In one famous example, he counsels Alexander to be "a leader to the Greeks and a despot to the barbarians, to look after the former as after friends and relatives, and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants".
308	By 335 BC he had returned to Athens, establishing his own school there known as the Lyceum.
308	Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years.
308	While in Athens, his wife Pythias died and Aristotle became involved with Herpyllis of Stagira, who bore him a son whom he named after his father, Nicomachus.
308	According to the Suda, he also had an eromenos, Palaephatus of Abydus.
308	It is during this period in Athens from 335 to 323 BC when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works.
308	Aristotle wrote many dialogues, only fragments of which survived.
308	The works that have survived are in treatise form and were not, for the most part, intended for widespread publication, as they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students.
308	His most important treatises include Physics, Metaphysics, Nicomachean Ethics, Politics, De Anima (On the Soul) and Poetics.
308	Aristotle not only studied almost every subject possible at the time, but made significant contributions to most of them.
308	In physical science, Aristotle studied anatomy, astronomy, embryology, geography, geology, meteorology, physics and zoology.
308	In philosophy, he wrote on aesthetics, ethics, government, metaphysics, politics, economics, psychology, rhetoric and theology.
308	He also studied education, foreign customs, literature and poetry.
308	His combined works constitute a virtual encyclopedia of Greek knowledge.
308	It has been suggested that Aristotle was probably the last person to know everything there was to be known in his own time.
308	Near the end of Alexander's life, Alexander began to suspect plots against himself, and threatened Aristotle in letters.
308	Aristotle had made no secret of his contempt for Alexander's pretense of divinity, and the king had executed Aristotle's grandnephew Callisthenes as a traitor.
308	A widespread tradition in antiquity suspected Aristotle of playing a role in Alexander's death, but there is little evidence for this.
308	Upon Alexander's death, anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens once again flared.
308	Eurymedon the hierophant denounced Aristotle for not holding the gods in honor.
308	Aristotle fled the city to his mother's family estate in Chalcis, explaining, "I will not allow the Athenians to sin twice against philosophy," a reference to Athens's prior trial and execution of Socrates.
308	He died in Euboea of natural causes within the year (in 322 BC).
308	Aristotle named chief executor his student Antipater and left a will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife.
308	Thought Logic With the Prior Analytics, Aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic, and his conception of it was the dominant form of Western logic until 19th century advances in mathematical logic.
308	Kant stated in the Critique of Pure Reason that Aristotle's theory of logic completely accounted for the core of deductive inference.
308	History Aristotle "says that 'on the subject of reasoning' he 'had nothing else on an earlier date to speak of'".
308	However, Plato reports that syntax was devised before him, by Prodicus of Ceos, who was concerned by the correct use of words.
308	Logic seems to have emerged from dialectics; the earlier philosophers made frequent use of concepts like reductio ad absurdum in their discussions, but never truly understood the logical implications.
308	Even Plato had difficulties with logic; although he had a reasonable conception of a deductive system, he could never actually construct one and relied instead on his dialectic.
308	Plato believed that deduction would simply follow from premises, hence he focused on maintaining solid premises so that the conclusion would logically follow.
308	Consequently, Plato realized that a method for obtaining conclusions would be most beneficial.
308	He never succeeded in devising such a method, but his best attempt was published in his book Sophist, where he introduced his division method.
308	Analytics and the Organon What we today call Aristotelian logic, Aristotle himself would have labeled "analytics".
308	The term "logic" he reserved to mean dialectics.
308	Most of Aristotle's work is probably not in its original form, since it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers.
308	The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into six books in about the early 1st century AD: #Categories #On Interpretation #Prior Analytics #Posterior Analytics #Topics #On Sophistical Refutations The order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle's writings.
308	It goes from the basics, the analysis of simple terms in the Categories, the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in On Interpretation, to the study of more complex forms, namely, syllogisms (in the Analytics) and dialectics (in the Topics and Sophistical Refutations).
308	The first three treatises form the core of the logical theory stricto sensu: the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning.
308	There is one volume of Aristotle's concerning logic not found in the Organon, namely the fourth book of Metaphysics.
308	Aristotle's scientific method Like his teacher Plato, Aristotle's philosophy aims at the universal.
308	Aristotle, however, finds the universal in particular things, which he calls the essence of things, while Plato finds that the universal exists apart from particular things, and is related to them as their prototype or exemplar.
308	For Aristotle, therefore, philosophic method implies the ascent from the study of particular phenomena to the knowledge of essences, while for Plato philosophic method means the descent from a knowledge of universal Forms (or ideas) to a contemplation of particular imitations of these.
308	For Aristotle, "form" still refers to the unconditional basis of phenomena but is "instantiated" in a particular substance (see Universals and particulars, below).
308	In a certain sense, Aristotle's method is both inductive and deductive, while Plato's is essentially deductive from a priori principles.
308	In Aristotle's terminology, "natural philosophy" is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences.
308	In modern times, the scope of philosophy has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries, such as ethics and metaphysics, in which logic plays a major role.
308	Today's philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the scientific method.
308	In contrast, Aristotle's philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry.
308	In the larger sense of the word, Aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as "science".
308	Note, however, that his use of the term science carries a different meaning than that covered by the term "scientific method".
308	For Aristotle, "all science (dianoia) is either practical, poetical or theoretical" (Metaphysics 1025b25).
308	By practical science, he means ethics and politics; by poetical science, he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts; by theoretical science, he means physics, mathematics and metaphysics.
308	If logic (or "analytics") is regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy, the divisions of Aristotelian philosophy would consist of: (1) Logic; (2) Theoretical Philosophy, including Metaphysics, Physics and Mathematics; (3) Practical Philosophy and (4) Poetical Philosophy.
308	In the period between his two stays in Athens, between his times at the Academy and the Lyceum, Aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today.
308	In fact, most of Aristotle's life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science.
308	Aristotle's metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics.
308	He did, however, perform original research in the natural sciences, e.g., botany, zoology, physics, astronomy, chemistry, meteorology, and several other sciences.
308	Aristotle's writings on science are largely qualitative, as opposed to quantitative.
308	Beginning in the 16th century, scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences, and Aristotle's work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate.
308	His failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass, velocity, force and inadequate.
308	Hitemperature.
308	He had a conception of speed and temperature, but no quantitative understanding of them, which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices, like clocks and thermometers.
308	His writings provide an account of many scientific observations, a mixture of precocious accuracy and curious errors.
308	For example, in his History of Animals he claimed that human males have more teeth than females.
308	In a similar vein, John Philoponus, and later Galileo, showed by simple experiments that Aristotle's theory that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect.
308	On the other hand, Aristotle refuted Democritus's claim that the Milky Way was made up of "those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun's rays," pointing out (correctly, even if such reasoning was bound to be dismissed for a long time) that, given "current astronomical demonstrations" that "the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun, then ...
308	" In places, Aristotle goes too far in deriving 'laws of the universe' from simple observation and over-stretched reason.
308	Today's scientific method assumes that such thinking without sufficient facts is ineffective, and that discerning the validity of one's hypothesis requires far more rigorous experimentation than that which Aristotle used to support his laws.
308	Aristotle also had some scientific blind spots.
308	He posited a geocentric cosmology that we may discern in selections of the Metaphysics, which was widely accepted up until the 16th century.
308	From the 3rd century to the 16th century, the dominant view held that the Earth was the rotational center of the universe.
308	Since he was perhaps the philosopher most respected by European thinkers during and after the Renaissance, these thinkers often took Aristotle's erroneous positions as given, which held back science in this epoch.
308	However, Aristotle's scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields.
308	For instance, he founded logic as a formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia.
308	Moreover, he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants.
308	Geology As quoted from Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology: He [Aristotle] refers to many examples of changes now constantly going on, and insists emphatically on the great results which they must produce in the lapse of ages.
308	He instances particular cases of lakes that had dried up, and deserts that had at length become watered by rivers and fertilized.
308	He points to the growth of the Nilotic delta since the time of Homer, to the shallowing of the Palus Maeotis within sixty years from his own time ...
308	He alludes ...
308	Eolian islands, previous to a volcanic eruption.
308	The changes of the earth, he says, are so slow in comparison to the duration of our lives, that they are overlooked; and the migrations of people after great catastrophes, and their removal to other regions, cause the event to be forgotten.He says [12th chapter of his Meteorics] 'the distribution of land and sea in particular regions does not endure throughout all time, but it becomes sea in those parts where it was land, and again it becomes land where it was sea, and there is reason for thinking that these changes take place according to a certain system, and within a certain period.'
308	The concluding observation is as follows: 'As time never fails, and the universe is eternal, neither the Tanais, nor the Nile, can have flowed for ever.
308	The places where they rise were once dry, and there is a limit to their operations, but there is none to time.
308	So also of all other rivers; they spring up and they perish; and the sea also continually deserts some lands and invades others The same tracts, therefore, of the earth are not some always sea, and others always continents, but every thing changes in the course of time.'
308	Physics Five elements Aristotle proposed a fifth element, aether, in addition to the four proposed earlier by Empedocles.
308	Earth, which is cold and dry; this corresponds to the modern idea of a solid.
308	Water, which is cold and wet; this corresponds to the modern idea of a liquid.
308	Air, which is hot and wet; this corresponds to the modern idea of a gas.
308	Fire, which is hot and dry; this corresponds to the modern ideas of plasma and heat.
308	Aether, which is the divine substance that makes up the heavenly spheres and heavenly bodies (stars and planets).
308	Each of the four earthly elements has its natural place.
308	All that is earthly tends toward the center of the universe, i.e., the center of the Earth.
308	Water tends toward a sphere surrounding the center.
308	Air tends toward a sphere surrounding the water sphere.
308	Fire tends toward the lunar sphere (in which the Moon orbits).
308	When elements are moved out of their natural place, they naturally move back towards it.
308	This is "natural motion"—motion requiring no extrinsic cause.
308	So, for example, in water, earthy bodies sink while air bubbles rise up; in air, rain falls and flame rises.
308	Outside all the other spheres, the heavenly, fifth element, manifested in the stars and planets, moves in the perfection of circles.
308	Motion Aristotle defined motion as the actuality of a potentiality as such.
308	Aquinas suggested that the passage be understood literally; that motion can indeed be understood as the active fulfillment of a potential, as a transition toward a potentially possible state.
308	Because actuality and potentiality are normally opposites in Aristotle, other commentators either suggest that the wording which has come down to us is erroneous, or that the addition of the "as such" to the definition is critical to understanding it.
308	Causality, The Four Causes Aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active causal factors: *Material cause describes the material out of which something is composed.
308	Thus the material cause of a table is wood, and the material cause of a car is rubber and steel.
308	It is not about action.
308	It does not mean one domino knocks over another domino.
308	The formal cause is its form, i.e., the arrans not mean ogement of that matter.
308	It tells us what a thing is, that any thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype.
308	It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation.
308	Plainly put the formal cause is the idea existing in the first place as exemplar in the mind of the sculptor, and in the second place as intrinsic, determining cause, embodied in the matter.
308	Formal cause could only refer to the essential quality of causation.
308	A more simple example of the formal cause is the blueprint or plan that one has before making or causing a human made object to exist.
308	The efficient cause is "the primary source", or that from which the change or the ending of the change first starts.
308	It identifies 'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed' and so suggests all sorts of agents, nonliving or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest.
308	Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of "cause" as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs.
308	More simply again that which immediately sets the thing in motion.
308	So take the two dominos this time of equal weighting, the first is knocked over causing the second also to fall over.
308	This is effectively efficient cause.
308	The final cause is its purpose, or that for the sake of which a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities.
308	The final cause or telos is the purpose or end that something is supposed to serve, or it is that from which and that to which the change is.
308	This also covers modern ideas of mental causation involving such psychological causes as volition, need, motivation or motives, rational, irrational, ethical, and all that gives purpose to behavior.
308	Additionally, things can be causes of one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, although not in the same way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal.
308	Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect).
308	Moreover, Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects; its presence and absence may result in different outcomes.
308	Simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event (not necessarily a mental goal).
308	Taking our two dominos, it requires someone to intentionally knock the dominos over as they cannot fall themselves.
308	Aristotle marked two modes of causation: proper (prior) causation and accidental (chance) causation.
308	All causes, proper and incidental, can be spoken as potential or as actual, particular or generic.
308	The same language refers to the effects of causes, so that generic effects assigned to generic causes, particular effects to particular causes, operating causes to actual effects.
308	Essentially, causality does not suggest a temporal relation between the cause and the effect.
308	Optics Aristotle held more accurate theories on some optical concepts than other philosophers of his day.
308	The earliest known written evidence of a camera obscura can be found in Aristotle's documentation of such a device in 350 BC in Problemata.
308	Aristotle's apparatus contained a dark chamber that had a single small hole, or aperture, to allow for sunlight to enter.
308	Aristotle used the device to make observations of the sun and noted that no matter what shape the hole was, the sun would still be correctly displayed as a round object.
308	In modern cameras, this is analogous to the diaphragm.
308	Aristotle also made the observation that when the distance between the aperture and the surface with the image increased, the image was magnified.
308	Chance and spontaneity According to Aristotle, spontaneity and chance are causes of some things, distinguishable from other types of cause.
308	Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things.
308	It is "from what is spontaneous" (but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance).
308	For a better understanding of Aristotle's conception of "chance" it might be better to think of "coincidence": Something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place, but with the result of another thing (not intended) taking place.
308	For example: A person seeks donations.
308	That person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum.
308	However, if the person seeking the donations met the person donating, not for the purpose of collecting donations, but for some other purpose, Aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance.
308	It must be unusual that something happens by chance.
308	In other words, if something happens all or most of the time, we cannot say that it is by chance.
308	There is also more specific kind of chance, which Aristotle names "luck", that can only apply to human beings, since it is in the sphere of moral actions.
308	According to Aristotle, luck must involve choice (and thus deliberation), and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice.
308	"What is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance".
308	Metaphysics Aristotle defines metaphysics as "the knowledge of immaterial being," or of "being in the highest degree of abstraction."
308	He refers to metaphysics as "first philosophy", as well as "the theologic science."
308	Substance, potentiality and actuality Aristotle examines the concepts of substance and essence (ousia) in his Metaphysics (Book VII), and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form.
308	In book VIII, he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum, or the stuff of which it is composed.
308	For example, the matter of a house is the bricks, stones, timbers etc., or whatever constitutes the potential house, while the form of the substance is the actual house, namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other differentia (see also predicables) that let us define something as a house.
308	The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.
308	With regard to the change (kinesis) and its causes now, as he defines in his Physics and On Generation and Corruption 319b-320a, he distinguishes the coming to be from: # growth and diminution, which is change in quantity; # locomotion, which is change in space; and # alteration, which is change in quality.
308	The coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property.
308	In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality (dynamis) and actuality (entelecheia) in association with the matter and the form.
308	Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if the conditions are right and it is not prevented thing is cby something else.
308	For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (dynamei) plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant.
308	Potentially beings can either 'act' (poiein) or 'be acted upon' (paschein), which can be either innate or learned.
308	For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate – being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise – acting).
308	Actuality is the fulfillment of the end of the potentiality.
308	Because the end (telos) is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end.
308	Referring then to our previous example, we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do.
308	"For that for the sake of which a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired.
308	For animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see."
308	In summary, the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities, which is also a final cause or end.
308	Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality.
308	With this definition of the particular substance (i.e., matter and form), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, for example, "what is it that makes a man one"?
308	Since, according to Plato there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity?
308	However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same thing.
308	Universals and particulars Aristotle's predecessor, Plato, argued that all things have a universal form, which could be either a property, or a relation to other things.
308	When we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyze a form of an apple.
308	In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple.
308	Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other.
308	Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things.
308	For example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but "good" is still a proper universal form.
308	Bertrand Russell is a contemporary philosopher who agreed with Plato on the existence of "uninstantiated universals".
308	Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated.
308	Aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things.
308	According to Aristotle, if a universal exists, either as a particular or a relation, then there must have been, must be currently, or must be in the future, something on which the universal can be predicated.
308	Consequently, according to Aristotle, if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time, then it does not exist.
308	In addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals.
308	As Plato spoke of the world of the forms, a location where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated.
308	So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms.
308	Biology and medicine In Aristotelian science, most especially in biology, things he saw himself have stood the test of time better than his retelling of the reports of others, which contain error and superstition.
308	He dissected animals but not humans; his ideas on how the human body works have been almost entirely superseded.
308	Empirical research program Aristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail.
308	Aristotle certainly did research on the natural history of Lesbos, and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas.
308	The works that reflect this research, such as History of Animals, Generation of Animals, and Parts of Animals, contain some observations and interpretations, along with sundry myths and mistakes.
308	The most striking passages are about the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen.
308	His observations on catfish, electric fish (Torpedo) and angler-fish are detailed, as is his writing on cephalopods, namely, Octopus, Sepia (cuttlefish) and the paper nautilus (Argonauta argo).
308	His description of the hectocotyl arm was about two thousand years ahead of its time, and widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the 19th century.
308	He separated the aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called Selachē (selachians).
308	Another good example of his methods comes from the Generation of Animals in which Aristotle describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs at intervals to observe when visible organs were generated.
308	He gave accurate descriptions of ruminants' four-chambered fore-stomachs, and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark Mustelus mustelus.
308	Classification of living things Aristotle's classification of living things contains some elements which still existed in the 19th century.
308	What the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates, Aristotle called 'animals with blood' and 'animals without blood' (he was not to know that complex invertebrates do make use of hemoglobin, but of a different kind from vertebrates).
308	Animals with blood were divided into live-bearing (humans and mammals), and egg-bearing (birds and fish).
308	Invertebrates ('animals without blood') are insects, crustacea (divided into non-shelled – cephalopods – and shelled) and testacea (molluscs).
308	In some respects, this incomplete classification is better than that of Linnaeus, who crowded the invertebrata together into two groups, Insecta and Vermes (worms).
308	For Charles Singer, "Nothing is more remarkable than [Aristotle's] efforts to [exhibit] the relationships of living things as a scala naturae" Aristotle's History of Animals classified organisms in relation to a hierarchical "Ladder of Life" (scala naturae), placing them according to complexity of structure and function so that higher organisms showed greater vitality and ability to move.
308	Aristotle believed that intellectual purposes, i.e., final causes, guided all natural processes.
308	Such a teleological view gave Aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design.
308	Noting that "no animal has, at the same time, both tusks and horns," and "a single-hooved animal with two horns I have never seen," Aristotle suggested that Nature, giving no animal both horns and tusks, was staving off vanity, and giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary.
308	Noting that ruminants had multiple stomaures faculties onlychs and weak teeth, he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter, with Nature trying to preserve a type of balance.
308	In a similar fashion, Aristotle believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to man, the scala naturae or Great Chain of Being.
308	His system had eleven grades, arranged according "to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality", expressed in their form at birth.
308	The highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive, the lowest bore theirs cold, dry, and in thick eggs.
308	Aristotle also held that the level of a creature's perfection was reflected in its form, but not preordained by that form.
308	Ideas like this, and his ideas about souls, are not regarded as science at all in modern times.
308	He placed emphasis on the type(s) of soul an organism possessed, asserting that plants possess a vegetative soul, responsible for reproduction and growth, animals a vegetative and a sensitive soul, responsible for mobility and sensation, and humans a vegetative, a sensitive, and a rational soul, capable of thought and reflection.
308	Aristotle, in contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the Egyptians, placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain.
308	Notable is Aristotle's division of sensation and thought, which generally went against previous philosophers, with the exception of Alcmaeon.
308	Successor: Theophrastus Aristotle's successor at the Lyceum, Theophrastus, wrote a series of books on botany—the History of Plants—which survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany, even into the Middle Ages.
308	Many of Theophrastus' names survive into modern times, such as carpos for fruit, and pericarpion for seed vessel.
308	Rather than focus on formal causes, as Aristotle did, Theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme, drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes, and relying on Aristotle's concept of the efficient cause.
308	Theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants, though this last discovery was lost in later ages.
308	Influence on Hellenistic medicine After Theophrastus, the Lyceum failed to produce any original work.
308	Though interest in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly.
308	It is not until the age of Alexandria under the Ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found.
308	The first medical teacher at Alexandria, Herophilus of Chalcedon, corrected Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation.
308	Herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries, noting that the latter pulse while the former do not.
308	Though a few ancient atomists such as Lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of Aristotelian ideas about life, teleology (and after the rise of Christianity, natural theology) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries.
308	Ernst Mayr claimed that there was "nothing of any real consequence in biology after Lucretius and Galen until the Renaissance."
308	Aristotle's ideas of natural history and medicine survived, but they were generally taken unquestioningly.
308	Psychology Aristotle's psychology, given in his treatise On the Soul (peri psyche, often known by its Latin title De Anima), posits three kinds of soul ("psyches"): the vegetative soul, the sensitive soul, and the rational soul.
308	Humans have a rational soul.
308	This kind of soul is capable of the same powers as the other kinds: Like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself; like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally.
308	The unique part of the human, rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and compare them.
308	For Aristotle, the soul (psyche) was a simpler concept than it is for us today.
308	By soul he simply meant the form of a living being.
308	Since all beings are composites of form and matter, the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings, e.g.
308	Aristotle considers types of movement).
308	Practical philosophy Ethics Aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study, i.e., one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake.
308	He wrote several treatises on ethics, including most notably, the Nicomachean Ethics.
308	Aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function (ergon) of a thing.
308	An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight.
308	Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans, and that this function must be an activity of the psuchē (normally translated as soul) in accordance with reason (logos).
308	Aristotle identified such an optimum activity of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action, eudaimonia, generally translated as "happiness" or sometimes "well being".
308	To have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character (ēthikē aretē), often translated as moral (or ethical) virtue (or excellence).
308	Aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately, but by teachers, and experience, leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things.
308	When the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom (phronesis) and their intellect (nous) can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker, or in other words, a philosopher.
308	Politics In addition to his works on etcom |date=14 August 2010 |hics, which address the individual, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled Politics.
308	Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community.
308	Moreover, he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual, "for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part".
308	He also famously stated that "man is by nature a political animal."
308	Aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine, and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others.
308	Aristotle's conception of the city is organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner.
308	The common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different to Aristotle's understanding.
308	Although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires, the natural community according to Aristotle was the city (polis) which functions as a political "community" or "partnership" (koinōnia).
308	The aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability, but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life, and to perform beautiful acts: "The political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together."
308	This is distinguished from modern approaches, beginning with social contract theory, according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of "fear of violent death" or its "inconveniences."
308	Rhetoric and poetics Aristotle considered epic poetry, tragedy, comedy, dithyrambic poetry and music to be imitative, each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.
308	For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language.
308	The forms also differ in their object of imitation.
308	Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average.
308	Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation – through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.
308	Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.
308	While it is believed that Aristotle's Poetics comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived.
308	Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and lyric poetry.
308	The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy.
308	Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions.
308	Aristotle concludes Poetics with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic mimesis.
308	He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.
308	Aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles, folklore, and proverbs; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the Delphic Oracle and studied the fables of Aesop.
308	Views on women Aristotle's analysis of procreation describes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive female element.
308	On this ground, feminists have accused Aristotle of misogyny and sexism.
308	However, Aristotle gave equal weight to women's happiness as he did to men's, and commented in his Rhetoric that a society cannot be happy unless women are happy too.
308	Loss and preservation of his works Modern scholarship reveals that Aristotle's "lost" works stray considerably in characterization from the surviving Aristotelian corpus.
308	Whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with an intent for subsequent publication, the surviving works do not appear to have been so.
308	Rather the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes unintended for publication.
308	The authenticity of a portion of the surviving works as originally Aristotelian is also today held suspect, with some books duplicating or summarizing each other, the authorship of one book questioned and another book considered to be unlikely Aristotle's at all.
308	Some of the individual works within the corpus, including the Constitution of Athens, are regarded by most scholars as products of Aristotle's "school," perhaps compiled under his direction or supervision.
308	Others, such as On Colors, may have been produced by Aristotle's successors at the Lyceum, e.g., Theophrastus and Straton.
308	Still others acquired Aristotle's name through similarities in doctrine or content, such as the De Plantis, possibly by Nicolaus of Damascus.
308	Other works in the corpus include medieval palmistries and astrological and magical texts whose connections to Aristotle are purely fanciful and self-promotional.
308	According to a distinction that originates with Aristotle himself, his writings are divisible into two groups: the "exoteric" and the "esoteric".
308	Most scholars have understood this as a distinction between works Aristotle intended for the public (exoteric), and the more technical works intended for use within the school (esoteric).
308	Modern scholars commonly assume these latter to be Aristotle's own (unpolished) lecture notes (or in some cases possible notes by his students).
308	However, one classic scholar offers an alternative interpretation.
308	The 5th century neoplatonist Ammonius Hermiae writes that Aristotle's writing style is deliberately obscurantist so that "good people may for that reason stretch their mind even more, whereas empty minds that are lost through carelessness will be put to flight by the obscurity when they encounter sentences like these."
308	Another common assumption is that none of the exoteric works is extant – that all of Aristotle's extant writings are of the esoteric kind.
308	Current knowledge of what exactly the exoteric writings were like is scant and dubious, though many of them may have been in dialogue form.
308	Fragments of some of Aristotle's dialogues have survived.) Perhaps it is to these that Cicero refers when he characterized Aristotle's writing style as "a river of gold"; it is hard for many modern readers to accept that one could seriously so admire the style of those works currently available to us.
308	However, some modern scholars have warned that we cannot know for certain that Cicero's praise was reserved specifically for the exoteric works; a few modern scholars have actually admired the concise writing style found in Aristotle's extant works.
308	One major question in the history of Aristotle's works, then, is how were the exoteric writings all lost, and how did the ones we now possess come to us?
308	The story of the original manuscripts of the esoteric treatises is described by Strabo in his Geography and Plutarch in his Parallel Lives.
308	The manuscripts were left from Aristotle to his successor Theophrastus, who in turn willed them to Neleus of Scepsis.
308	Neleus supposedly took the writings from Athens to Scepsis, where his heirs let them languish in a cellar until the 1st century BC, when Apellicon of Teos discovered and purchased the manuscripts, bringing them back to Athens.
308	According to the story, Apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts' stay in the basement, introducing a number of errors into the text.
308	When Lucius Cornelius Sulla occupied Athens in 86 BC, he carried off the library of Apellicon to Rome, where they were first published in 60 BC by the grammarian Tyrannion of Amisus and then by the philosopher Andronicus of Rhodes.
308	Carnes Lord attributes the popular belief in this story to the fact that it provides "the most plausible explanation for the rapid eclipse of the Peripatetic school after the middle of the third century, and for the absence of widespread knowledge of the specialized treatises of Aristotle throughout the Hellenistic period, as well as for the sudden reappearance of a flourishing Aristotelianism during the first century B.C."
308	Lord voices a number of reservations concerning this story, however.
308	First, the condition of the texts is far too good for them to have suffered considerable damage followed by Apellicon's inexpert attempt at repair.
308	Second, there is "incontrovertible evidence," Lord says, that the treatises were in circulation during the time in which Strabo and Plutarch suggest they were confined within the cellar in Scepsis.
308	Third, the definitive edition of Aristotle's texts seems to have been made in Athens some fifty years before Andronicus supposedly compiled his.
308	And fourth, ancient library catalogues predating Andronicus' intervention list an Aristotelian corpus quite similar to the one we currently possess.
308	Lord sees a number of post-Aristotelian interpolations in the Politics, for example, but is generally confident that the work has come down to us relatively intact.
308	On the one hand, the surviving texts of Aristotle do not derive from finished literary texts, but rather from working drafts used within Aristotle's school, as opposed, on the other hand, to the dialogues and other "exoteric" texts which Aristotle published more widely during his lifetime.
308	The consensus is that Andronicus of Rhodes collected the esoteric works of Aristotle's school which existed in the form of smaller, separate works, distinguished them from those of Theophrastus and other Peripatetics, edited them, and finally compiled them into the more cohesive, larger works as they are known today.
308	Legacy More than twenty-three hundred years after his death, Aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived.
308	He contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence, and he was the founder of many new fields.
308	According to the philosopher Bryan Magee, "it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did".
308	Among countless other achievements, Aristotle was the founder of formal logic, pioneered the study of zoology, and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method.
308	Despite these achievements, the influence of Aristotle's errors is considered by some to have held back science considerably.
308	Bertrand Russell notes that "almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine".
308	Russell also refers to Aristotle's ethics as "repulsive", and calls his logic "as definitely antiquated as Ptolemaic astronomy".
308	Russell notes that these errors make it difficult to do historical justice to Aristotle, until one remembers how large of an advance he made upon all of his predecessors.
308	Later Greek philosophers The immediate influence of Aristotle's work was felt as the Lyceum grew into the Peripatetic school.
308	Aristotle's notable students included Aristoxenus, Dicaearchus, Demetrius of Phalerum, Eudemos of Rhodes, Harpalus, Hephaestion, Meno, Mnason of Phocis, Nicomachus, and Theophrastus.
308	Aristotle's influence over Alexander the Great is seen in the latter's bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers.
308	He had also learned a great deal about Persian customs and traditions from his teacher.
308	Although his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotle's geography was clearly wrong, when the old philosopher released his works to the public, Alexander complained "Thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men's common property?"
308	Influence on Byzantine scholars Greek Christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of Aristotle by copying all the extant Greek language manuscripts of the corpus.
308	The first Greek Christians to comment extensively on Aristotle were John Philoponus, Elias, and David in the sixth century, and Stephen of Alexandria in the early seventh century.
308	John Philoponus stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of Aristotle's views on the eternity of the world, movement, and other elements of Aristotelian thought.
308	After a hiatus of several centuries, formal commentary by Eustratius and Michael of Ephesus reappears in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, apparently sponsored by Anna Comnena.
308	Influence on Islamic theologians Aristotle was one of the most revered Western thinkers in early Islamic theology.
308	Most of the still extant works of Aristotle, as well as a number of the original Greek commentaries, were translated into Arabic and studied by Muslim philosophers, scientists and scholars.
308	Averroes, Avicenna and Alpharabius, who wrote on Aristotle in great depth, also influenced Thomas Aquinas and other Western Christian scholastic philosophers.
308	Alkindus considered Aristotle as the outstanding and unique representative of philosophy and Averroes spoke of Aristotle as the "exemplar" for all future philosophers.
308	Medieval Muslim scholars regularly described Aristotle as the "First Teacher".
308	The title "teacher" was first given to Aristotle by Muslim scholars, and was later used by Western philosophers (as in the famous poem of Dante) who were influenced by the tradition of Islamic philosophy.
308	In accordance with the Greek theorists, the Muslims considered Aristotle to be a dogmatic philosopher, the author of a closed system, and believed that Aristotle shared with Plato essential tenets of thought.
308	Some went so far as to credit Aristotle himself with neo-Platonic metaphysical ideas.
308	Influence on Western Christian theologians With the loss of the study of ancient Greek in the early medieval Latin West, Aristotle was practically unknown there from c.
308	AD 600 to c.
308	Latin translation of the Organon made by Boethius.
308	In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, interest in Aristotle revived and Latin Christians had translations made, both from Arabic translations, such as those by Gerard of Cremona, and from the original Greek, such as those by James of Venice and William of Moerbeke.
308	After Thomas Aquinas wrote his theology, working from Moerbeke's translations, the demand for Aristotle's writings grew and the Greek manuscripts returned to the West, stimulating a revival of Aristotelianism in Europe that continued into the Renaissance.
308	Aristotle is referred to as "The Philosopher" by Scholastic thinkers such as Thomas Aquinas.
308	See Summa Theologica, Part I, Question 3, etc.
308	These thinkers blended Aristotelian philosophy with Christianity, bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages.
308	It required a repudiation of some Aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods.
308	The medieval English poet Chaucer describes his student as being happy by having                       at his beddes heed Twenty bookes, clad in blak or reed, Of aristotle and his philosophie, The Italian poet Dante says of Aristotle in the first circles of hell, I saw the Master there of those who know, Amid the philosophic family, By all admired, and by all reverenced; There Plato too I saw, and Socrates, Who stood beside him closer than the rest.
308	Post-Enlightenment thinkers The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from Aristotle.
308	However implausible this is, it is certainly the case that Aristotle's rigid separati86 Howon of action from production, and his justification of the subservience of slaves and others to the virtue – or arete – of a few justified the ideal of aristocracy.
308	It is Martin Heidegger, not Nietzsche, who elaborated a new interpretation of Aristotle, intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition.
308	Ayn Rand accredited Aristotle as "the greatest philosopher in history" and cited him as a major influence on her thinking.
308	More recently, Alasdair MacIntyre has attempted to reform what he calls the Aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti-elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and Nietzscheans.
308	List of works The works of Aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the Corpus Aristotelicum.
308	These texts, as opposed to Aristotle's lost works, are technical philosophical treatises from within Aristotle's school.
308	Reference to them is made according to the organization of Immanuel Bekker's Royal Prussian Academy edition (Aristotelis Opera edidit Academia Regia Borussica, Berlin, 1831–1870), which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works.
308	Honours Aristotle Mountains on Oscar II Coast in Graham Land, Antarctica are named after Aristotle.
309	An American in Paris is a symphonic tone poem by the American composer George Gershwin, written in 1928.
309	Inspired by the time Gershwin had spent in Paris, it evokes the sights and energy of the French capital in the 1920s.
309	It is one of Gershwin's best-known compositions.
309	Gershwin composed An American in Paris on commission from the New York Philharmonic.
309	He scored the piece for the standard instruments of the symphony orchestra plus celesta, saxophones, and automobile horns.
309	He brought back some Parisian taxi horns for the New York premiere of the composition, which took place on December 13, 1928 in Carnegie Hall, with Walter Damrosch conducting the New York Symphony.
309	Gershwin completed the orchestration on November 18, less than four weeks before the work's premiere.
309	Gershwin collaborated on the original program notes with the critic and composer Deems Taylor, noting that: "My purpose here is tprogram notes with the critic and composer [o portray the impression of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city and listens to various street noises and absorbs the French atmosphere."
309	When the tone poem moves into the blues, "our American friend ...
309	" But, "nostalgia is not a fatal disease."
309	The American visitor "once again is an alert spectator of Parisian life" and "the street noises and French atmosphere are triumphant."
309	Background Maurice Ravel met Gershwin in New York during Ravel's tour of the United States.
309	In that meeting, Gershwin asked Ravel to be his teacher, to which Ravel responded that it was better to be a first-rate Gershwin than a second-rate Ravel.
309	Instead, Ravel recommended that Gershwin see Nadia Boulanger in Paris.
309	Ravel's high praise of Gershwin in an introductory letter to Boulanger caused Gershwin to seriously consider taking time to study abroad in Paris.
309	Gershwin arrived in Paris in March 1928.
309	Paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers: among them Ezra Pound, W.
309	B.
309	Yeats, Ernest Hemingway; and artist Pablo Picasso.
309	Gershwin met with Boulanger and at her request he played ten minutes of his music.
309	Boulanger replied that she had nothing to teach him.
309	This did not set Gershwin back, as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on Paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his Rhapsody in Blue.
309	Composition Gershwin based An American in Paris on a melodic fragment called "Very Parisienne", written in 1926 on his first visit to Paris as a gift to his hosts, Robert and Mabel Schirmer.
309	He described the piece as a "rhapsodic ballet" because it was written freely and is more modern than his previous works.
309	Gershwin explained in Musical America, "My purpose here is to portray the impressions of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city, listens to the various street noises, and absorbs the French atmosphere."
309	The piece is structured into five sections, which culminate in a loose ABA format.
309	Gershwin's first A episode introduces the two main "walking" themes in the "Allegretto grazioso" and develops a third theme in the "Subito con brio".
309	The style of this A section is written in the typical French style of composers Claude Debussy and Les Six.
309	This A section featured duple meter, singsong rhythms, and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe, English horn, and taxi horns.
309	The B section's "Andante ma con ritmo deciso" introduces the American Blues and spasms of homesickness.
309	The "Allegro" that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster twelve-bar blues.
309	In the B section, Gershwin uses common time, syncopated rhythms, and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet, saxophone, and snare drum.
309	"Moderato con grazia" is the last A section that returns to the themes set in A.
309	After recapitulating the "walking" themes, Gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section B in the final “Grandioso.” Instrumentation An American in Paris is scored for 3 flutes (3rd doubling on piccolo), 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets in B flat, bass clarinet in B flat, 2 bassoons, 4 horns in F, 3 trumpets in B flat, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, snare drum, bass drum, triangle, wood block, cymbals, low and high tom-toms, xylophone, glockenspiel, celesta, 4 taxi horns resembling the pitches A, B, C and D, alto saxophone/soprano saxophone, tenor saxophone/soprano saxophone/alto saxophone, baritone saxophone/soprano saxophone/alto saxophone, and strings.
309	The revised edition by F.
309	Campbell-Watson calls for three saxophones, alto, tenor and baritone.
309	In this arrangement the soprano and alto doublings have been rewritten to avoid changing instruments.
309	William Daly arranged the score for piano solo which was published by New World Music in 1929.
309	Response Gershwin did not particularly like Walter Damrosch's interpretation at the world premiere of An American in Paris.
309	He stated that Damrosch's sluggish, dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work.
309	The audience, according to Edward Cushing, responded with "a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music, good and bad, ordinarily arouses."
309	Critics believed that An American in Paris was better crafted than his lukewarm Concerto in F.
309	Some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers César Franck, Richard Wagner, or Guillaume Lekeu on its premiere.
309	Gershwin responded to the critics, "It's not a Beethoven Symphony, you know… It's a humorous piece, nothing solemn about it.
309	It's not intended to draw tears.
309	If it pleases symphony audiences as a light, jolly piece, a series of impressions musically expressed, it succeeds."
309	Recordings An American in Paris has been frequently recorded.
309	The first recording was made for RCA Victor in 1929 with Nathaniel Shilkret conducting the Victor Symphony Orchestra, drawn from members of the Philadelphia Orchestra.
309	Gershwin was on hand to "supervise" the recording; however, Shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio.
309	Then, a little later, Shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief celesta solo during the slow section, so he hastily asked Gershwin if he might play the solo; Gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording.
309	The radio broadcast of the September 8, 1937 Hollywood Bowl George Gershwin Memorial Concert, in which An American in Paris, also conducted by Shilkret, was second on the program, was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two-CD set.
309	Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra recorded the work for RCA Victor, including one of the first stereo recordings of the music.
309	In 1945, Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra recorded the music in Carnegie Hall, one of the few commercial recordings Toscanini made of music by an American composer.
309	The Seattle Symphony also recorded a version in the 1980s of Gershwin's original score, before he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today.
309	Use in film In 1951, MGM released the musical An American in Paris, featuring Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron.
309	Winning the 1951 Best Picture Oscar and numerous other awards, the film was directed by Vincente Minnelli, featured many tunes of Gershwin, and concluded with an extensive, elaborate dance sequence built around the An American in Paris symphonic poem (arranged for the film by Johnny Green), costing $500,000.
309	A part of the symphonic composition is also featured in As Good as It Gets, released in 1997.
316	The Academy Awards are the oldest awards ceremony for achievements in motion pictures.
316	The Academy Award for Best Production Design recognizes achievement in art direction on a film.
316	The category's original name was Best Art Direction, but was changed to its current name in 2012 for the 85th Academy Awards, with the Art Director's branch being renamed the Designer's branch.
316	The films below are listed with their production year, so the Oscar 2000 for best art direction went to a film from 1999.

324	The Academy Awards, now officially known as The Oscars, are a set of awards given annually for excellence of cinematic achievements.
324	The Oscar statuette is officially named the Academy Award of Merit and is o cinematic achne of nine types of Academy Awards.
324	Organized and overseen by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), the awards are given each year at a formal ceremony.
324	The AMPAS was originally conceived by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio executive Louis B.
324	Mayer as a professional honorary organization to help improve the film industry’s image and help mediate labor disputes.
324	The awards themselves were later initiated by the Academy as awards "of merit for distinctive achievement" in the industry.
324	The awards were first given in 1929 at a ceremony created for the awards, at the Hotel Roosevelt in Hollywood.
324	Over the years that the award has been given, the categories presented have changed; currently Oscars are given in more than a dozen categories, and include films of various types.
324	As one of the most prominent award ceremonies in the world, the Academy Awards ceremony is televised live in more than 100 countries annually.
324	It is also the oldest award ceremony in the media; its equivalents, the Grammy Awards for music, the Emmy Awards for television, and the Tony Awards for theater, are all modeled after the Academy Awards.
324	The 85th Academy Awards were held on Sunday, February 24, 2013, at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California.
324	The 86th Academy Awards will be  held on Sunday, March 2, 2014, at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles.
324	This will be a week later than normal as not to interfere with the 2014 Winter Olympics.
324	History  The first awards were presented on May 16, 1929, at a private brunch at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel with an audience of about 270 people.
324	The post Academy Awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel.
324	The cost of guest tickets for that night's ceremony was $5.
324	Fifteen statuettes were awarded, honoring artists, directors and other personalities of the filmmaking industry of the time for their works during the 1927–1928 period.
324	Winners had been announced three months earlier; however, that was changed in the second ceremony of the Academy Awards in 1930.
324	Since then and during the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11 pm on the night of the awards.
324	This method was used until the Los Angeles Times announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result, the Academy has since 1941 used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners.
324	For the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years.
324	For example, the 2nd Academy Awards presented on April 3, 1930, recognized films that were released between August 1, 1928 and July 31, 1929.
324	Starting with the 7th Academy Awards, held in 1935, the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31.
324	The first Best Actor awarded was Emil Jannings, for his performances in The Last Command and The Way of All Flesh.
324	He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history.
324	The honored professionals were awarded for all the work done in a certain category for the qualifying period; for example, Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period.
324	Since the fourth ceremony, the system changed, and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film.
324	Oscars have been given for 1,853 awards.
324	A total of 302 actors have won Oscars in competitive acting categories or have been awarded Honorary or Juvenile Awards.
324	The 1939 film Beau Geste is the only movie that features as many as four Academy Award winners for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Gary Cooper, Ray Milland, Susan Hayward, Broderick Crawford) prior to any of the actors receiving the Best Actor Award.
324	At the 29th ceremony, held on March 27, 1957, the Best Foreign Language Film category was introduced.
324	Until then, foreign-language films were honored with the Special Achievement Award.
324	Oscar statuette  Design  Although there are eight other types of annual awards presented by the Academy (the Irving G.
324	Thalberg Memorial Award, the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, the Gordon E.
324	Sawyer Award, the Academy Scientific and Technical Award, the Academy Award for Technical Achievement, the John A.
324	Bonner Medal of Commendation, and the Student Academy Award) plus two awards that are not presented annually (the Special Achievement Award in the form of an Oscar statuette and the Honorary Award that may or may not be in the form of an Oscar statuette), the best known one is the Academy Award of Merit more popularly known as the Oscar statuette.
324	Made of gold-plated britannium on a black metal base, it is 13.5 in (34 cm) tall, weighs 8.5 lb (3.85 kg) and depicts a knight rendered in Art Deco style holding a crusader's sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes.
324	The five spokes each represent the original branches of the Academy: Actors, Writers, Directors, Producers, and Technicians.
324	In 1928, MGM's art director Cedric Gibbons, one of the original Academy members, supervised the design of the award trophy by printing the design on a scroll.
324	In need of a model for his statuette, Gibbons was introduced by his future wife Dolores del Río to Mexican film director and actor Emilio "El Indio" Fernández.
324	Reluctant at first, Fernández was finally convinced to pose nude to create what today is known as the "Oscar".
324	Then, sculptor George Stanley (who also did the Muse Fountain at the Hollywood Bowl) sculpted Gibbons's design in clay and Sachin Smith cast in}}the statuette in 92.5 percent tin and 7.5 percent copper and then gold-plated it.
324	The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base.
324	The original Oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the C.W.
324	Shumway & Sons Foundry in Batavia, Illinois, which also contributed to casting the molds for the Vince Lombardi Trophy and Emmy Awards statuettes.
324	Since 1983, approximately 50 Oscars are made each year in Chicago by Illinois manufacturer R.S.
324	Owens & Company.
324	In support of the American effort in World War II, the statuettes were made of plaster and were traded in for gold ones after the war had ended.
324	Naming  The origin of the name Oscar is disputed.
324	One biography of Bette Davis claims that she named the Oscar after her first husband, band leader Harmon Oscar Nelson; one of the earliest mentions in print of the term Oscar dates back to a Time magazine article about the 1934 6th Academy Awards.
324	Walt Disney is also quoted as thanking the Academy for his Oscar as early as 1932.
324	Another claimed origin is that the Academy's Executive Secretary, Margaret Herrick, first saw the award in 1931 and made reference to the statuette's reminding her of her "Uncle Oscar" (a nickname for her cousin Oscar Pierce).
324	Columnist Sidney Skolsky was present during Herrick's naming and seized the name in his byline, "Employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette 'Oscar'".
324	The trophy was officially dubbed the "Oscar" in 1939 by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences.
324	It may also have been named after the famous Irish playwright Oscar Wilde.
324	In 1882, when disembarking in New York to begin his "Grand Tour" of America, Wilde was asked by a customs officer whether he had anything to declare and reputedly replied "I have nothing to declare but my genius."
324	Ownership of Oscar statuettes  Since 1950, the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that neither winners nor their heirs may sell the statuettes without first offering to sell them back to the Academy for US$1.
324	If a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation, then the Academy keeps the statuette.
324	Academy Awards not protected by this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six-figure sums.
324	In December 2011, Orson Welles' sole 1941 Oscar for Citizen Kane (Best Original Screenplay) was put up for auction, after his heirs won a 2004 court decision that Welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the Academy.
324	While the Oscar is owned by the recipient, it is essentially not on the open market.
324	Michael Todd's grandson tried to sell Todd's Oscar statuette to a movie prop collector in 1989, but the Academy won the legal battle by getting a permanent injunction.
324	Although some Oscar sales transactions have been successful, some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the Academy, which keeps them in its treasury.
324	Nomination  Since 2004, Academy Award nomination results have been announced to the public in late January.
324	Prior to that, the results were announced in early February.
324	Voters  The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), a professional honorary organization, maintains a voting membership of 5,783 .
324	Academy membership is divided into different branches, with each representing a different discipline in film production.
324	Actors constitute the largest voting bloc, numbering 1,311 members (22 percent) of the Academy's composition.
324	Votes have been certified by the auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (and its predecessor Price Waterhouse) for the past 73 annual awards ceremonies.
324	All AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board of Governors, on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees.
324	Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contribution to the field of motion pictures.
324	New membership proposals are considered annually.
324	The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership, although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join.
324	The 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6,000 voting mse who have bembers.
324	While the membership had been growing, stricter policies have kept its size steady since then.
324	In May 2011, the Academy sent a letter advising its 6,000 or so voting members that an online system for Oscar voting will be implemented in 2013.
324	Rules  According to Rules 2 and 3 of the official Academy Awards Rules, a film must open in the previous calendar year, from midnight at the start of January 1 to midnight at the end of December 31, in Los Angeles County, California, to qualify (except for the Best Foreign Language Film).
324	For example, the 2009 Best Picture winner, The Hurt Locker, was actually first released in 2008, but did not qualify for the 2008 awards as it did not play its Oscar-qualifying run in Los Angeles until mid-2009, thus qualifying for the 2009 awards.
324	Rule 2 states that a film must be feature-length, defined as a minimum of 40 minutes, except for short subject awards, and it must exist either on a 35 mm or 70 mm film print or in 24 frame/s or 48 frame/s progressive scan digital cinema format with native resolution not less than 1280x720.
324	Producers must submit an Official Screen Credits online form before the deadline; in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline, the film will be ineligible for Academy Awards in any year.
324	The form includes the production credits for all related categories.
324	Then, each form is checked and put in a Reminder List of Eligible Releases.
324	In late December ballots and copies of the Reminder List of Eligible Releases are mailed to around 6000 active members.
324	For most categories, members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories (i.e.
324	There are some exceptions in the case of certain categories, like Foreign Film, Documentary and Animated Feature Film, in which movies are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches.
324	In the special case of Best Picture, all voting members are eligible to select the nominees for that category.
324	Foreign films must include English subtitles, and each country can submit only one film per year.
324	The members of the various branches nominate those in their respective fields, while all members may submit nominees for Best Picture.
324	The winners are then determined by a second round of voting in which all members are then allowed to vote in most categories, including Best Picture.
324	Ceremony  Telecast  The major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony, most commonly in late February or early March following the relevant calendar year, and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees.
324	It is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during November or December of the previous year.
324	This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day.
324	Black tie dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a bow-tie, and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this.
324	The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast).
324	The Academy Awards is televised live across the United States (excluding Hawaii; they aired live in Alaska starting in 2011 for the first time since 1996), Canada, the United Kingdom, and gathers millions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world.
324	The 2007 ceremony was watched by more than 40 million Americans.
324	Other awards ceremonies (such as the Emmys, Golden Globes, and Grammys) are broadcast live in the East Coast but are on tape delay in the West Coast and might not air on the same day outside North America (if the awards are even televised).
324	The Academy has for several years claimed that the award show has up to a billion viewers internationally, but this has so far not been confirmed by any independent sources.
324	The Awards show was first televised on NBC in 1953.
324	NBC continued to broadcast the event until 1960 when the ABC Network took over, televising the festivities through 1970, after which NBC resumed the broadcasts.
324	ABC once again took over broadcast duties in 1976; it is under contract to do so through the year 2020.
324	After more than 60 years of being held in late March or early April, the ceremonies were moved up to late February or early March starting in 2004 to help disrupt and shorten the intense lobbying and ad campaigns associated with Oscar season in the film industry.
324	Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship, which would cut into the Academy Awards audience.
324	The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February sweeps period.
324	Some years, the ceremony is moved into early March in deference to the Winter Olympics.) Advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast.
324	The Awards show holds the distinction of having won the most Emmys in history, with 47 wins and 195 nominations.
324	After many years of being held on Mondays at 9:00 pm Eastern/6:00 p.m Pacific, in 1999 the ceremonies were moved to Sundays at 8:30 pm Eastern/5:30 pm Pacific.
324	The reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays, that Los Angeles rush-hour traffic jams could be avoided, and that an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast to go to bed earlier.
324	For many years the film industry had opposed a Sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office.
324	On March 30, 1981, the awards ceremony was postponed for one day after the shooting of President Ronald Reagan and others in Washington, D.C.
324	In 1993, an In Memoriam segment was introduced, honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding 12 months, a selection compiled by a small committee of Academy members.
324	This segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names.
324	In 2010, the organizers of the Academy Awards announced that winners' acceptance speeches must not run past 45 seconds.
324	This, according to organizer Bill Mechanic, was to ensure the elimination of what he termed "the single most hated thing on the show" – overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion.
324	The Academy has also had recent discussions about moving the ceremony even further back into January, citing TV viewers' fatigue with the film industry's long awards season.
324	But such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members, to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers (as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail).
324	Also, a January ceremony may have to compete with National Football League playoff games.
324	Awards ceremonies  The following is a listing of all Academy Awards ceremonies.
330	Actrius (Catalan: Actresses) is a 1996 film directed by Ventura Pons.
330	In the film, there are no male actors and the four leading actresses dubbed themselves in the Castilian version.
330	Synopsis In order to prepare the role of an important old actress, a theatre student interviews three actresses who were her pupils: an international diva (Glòria Marc, played by Núria Espert), a television star (Assumpta Roca, played by Rosa Maria Sardà) and a dubbing director (Maria Caminal, played by Anna Lizaran).
332	Animalia (ISBN 0810918684) is an illustrated children's book by Graeme Base.
332	It was published in 1986.
332	Animalia is an alliterative alphabet book and contains twenty-six illustrations, one for each letter of the alphabet.
332	Each illustration features an animal from the animal kingdom (A is for alligator, B is for butterfly, etc.) along with a short poem utilizing the letter of the page for many of the words.
332	The illustrations contain many other objects beginning with that letter that the reader can try to identify.
332	As an additional challenge, the author has hidden a picture of himself as a child in every picture.
332	In 1987, Animalia won the title of Honour Book in the Children's Book Council of Australia Children's Book of the Year Award: Picture Book.
332	In 1996, a tenth anniversary edition was released.
332	Base also published a colouring book version for children to do their own colouring.
332	A television series was also created, based on the book, which airs in the United States, Australia, Canada, the UK, Norway and Venezuela.
332	It also airs on Minimax for the Czech and Slovak Republics.
332	And recently in Greece on the channel ET1.
332	Graeme Base also created a series of riddles relating to hidden objects within each of the illustrations written especially for the wall frieze.
332	In 2010, The Base Factory and AppBooks released Animalia as an application for iPad and iPhone/iPod Touch.
334	International Atomic Time (TAI, from the French name Temps atomique international) is a high-precision atomic coordinate time standard based on the notional passage of proper time on Earth's geoid.
334	It is the basis for Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which is used for civil timekeeping all over the Earth's surface, and for Terrestrial Time, which is used for astronomical calculations.
334	Since 30 June 2012 when the last leap second was added, TAI has been exactly 35 seconds ahead of UTC.
334	The 35 seconds results from the initial difference of 10 seconds at the start of 1972, plus 25 leap seconds in UTC since 1972.
334	Time coordinates on the TAI scales are conventionally specified using traditional means of specifying days, carried over from non-uniform time standards based on the rotation of the Earth.
334	Specifically, both Julian Dates and the Gregorian calendar are used.
334	TAI in this form was synchronised with Universal Time at the beginning of 1958, and the two have drifted apart ever since, due to the changing motion of the Earth.
334	Operation   TAI as a time scale is a weighted average of the time kept by over 200 atomic clocks in over 50 national laboratories worldwide.
334	The clocks are compared using GPS signals and two-way satellite time and frequency transfer.
334	Due to the averaging it is far more stable than any clock would be alone (see signal averaging for a discussion).
334	The majority of the clocks are caesium clocks; the definition of the SI second is written in terms of caesium.
334	The participating institutions each broadcast, in real time, a frequency signal with time codes, which is their estimate of TAI.
334	Time codes are usually published in the form of UTC, which differs from TAI by a well-known integer number of seconds.
334	These time scales are denoted in the form UTC(NPL) in the UTC form, where NPL in this case identifies the National Physical Laboratory, UK.
334	The TAI form may be denoted TAI(NPL).
334	The latter is not to be confused with TA(NPL), which denotes an independent atomic time scale, not synchronised to TAI or to anything else.
334	The clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other.
334	The International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM, France), combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible.
334	This combined time scale is published monthly in [ftp://ftp2.bipm.fr/pub/tai/publication/cirt/ Circular T], and is the canonical TAI.
334	This time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences UTC-UTC(k) (equivalent to TAI-TAI(k)) for each participating institution k.
334	The same circular also gives tables of TAI-TA(k), for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales.) Errors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty Circular T or by errata in a subsequent Circular T.
334	Aside from this, once published in Circular T the TAI scale is not revised.
334	In hindsight it is possible to discover errors in TAI, and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale.
334	Doing so does not create another version of TAI; it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of Terrestrial Time (TT).
334	History Early atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock; the atomic clocks were not operated continuously.
334	Atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in 1955, using the first caesium atomic clock at the National Physical Laboratory, UK (NPL).
334	The "Greenwich Atomic" (GA) scale began in 1955 at the Royal Greenwich Observatory.
334	The International Time Bureau (BIH) began a time scale, Tm or AM, in July 1955, using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of VLF radio signals.
334	The United States Naval Observatory began the A.1 scale  13 September 1956, using an Atomichron commercial atomic clock, followed by the NBS-A scale at the National Bureau of Standards, Boulder, Colorado.
334	Both the BIH scale and A.1 was defined by an epoch at the beginning of 1958: it was setcale and to read Julian Date 2436204.5 (1 January 1958 00:00:00) at the corresponding UT2 instant.
334	The procedures used by the BIH evolved, and the name for the time scale changed: "A3" in 1963 and "TA(BIH)" in 1969.
334	This synchronisation was inevitably imperfect, depending as it did on the astronomical realisation of UT2.
334	At the time, UT2 as published by various observatories differed by several hundredths of a second.
334	In 1961, UTC began.
334	UTC is a discontinuous time scale composed from segments that are linear transformations of atomic time, the discontinuities being arranged so that UTC approximated UT2 until the end of 1971, and UT1 thereafter.
334	This was a compromise arrangement for a broadcast time scale: a linear transformation of the BIH's atomic time meant that the time scale was stable and internationally synchronised, while approximating UT1 means that tasks such as navigation which require a source of Universal Time continue to be well served by public time broadcasts.
334	The SI second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in 1967, and in 1971 it was renamed International Atomic Time (TAI).
334	In the 1970s, it became clear that the clocks participating in TAI were ticking at different rates due to gravitational time dilation, and the combined TAI scale therefore corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks.
334	Starting from Julian Date 2443144.5 (1 January 1977 00:00:00), corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks, so that TAI would correspond to proper time at mean sea level (the geoid).
334	Because the clocks had been on average well above sea level, this meant that TAI slowed down, by about 10−12.
334	The former uncorrected time scale continues to be published, under the name EAL (Echelle Atomique Libre, meaning Free Atomic Scale).
334	The instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for Barycentric Coordinate Time (TCB), Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG), and Terrestrial Time (TT).
334	All three of these time scales were defined to read JD 2443144.5003725 (1 January 1977 00:00:32.184) exactly at that instant.
334	The offset is to provide continuity with the older Ephemeris Time.)  TAI was henceforth a realisation of TT, with the equation TT(TAI) = TAI + 32.184 s.
334	The continued existence of TAI was questioned in a 2007 letter from the BIPM to the ITU-R which stated "In the case of a redefinition of UTC without leap seconds, the CCTF would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing TAI, as it would remain parallel to the continuous UTC."
336	Altruism or selflessness is the principle or practice of concern for the welfare of others.
336	It is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions, though the concept of "others" toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions.
336	Altruism or selflessness is the opposite of selfishness.
336	Altruism can be distinguished from feelings of duty and loyalty.
336	Altruism is a motivation to provide something of value to a party who must be anyone but one's self, while duty focuses on a moral obligation towards a specific individual (e.g., a god, a king), or collective (e.g., a government).
336	Pure altruism consists of sacrificing something for someone other than the self (e.g.
336	Much debate exists as to whether "true" altruism is possible.
336	The theory of psychological egoism suggests that no act of sharing, helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic, as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal gratification.
336	The validity of this argument depends on whether intrinsic rewards qualify as "benefits."
336	The term altruism may also refer to an etqualify as &hical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others.
336	Used in this sense, it's usually contrasted to egoism, which is defined as acting to the benefit of one's self.
336	The notion of altruism The concept has a long history in philosophical and ethical thought.
336	The term was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding sociologist and philosopher of science, Auguste Comte, and has become a major topic for psychologists (especially evolutionary psychology researchers), evolutionary biologists, and ethologists.
336	Whilst ideas about altruism from one field can have an impact on the other fields, the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism.
336	In simple terms, altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them.
336	Scientific viewpoints Anthropology Marcel Mauss's book The Gift contains a passage: "Note on alms."
336	This note describes the evolution of the notion of alms (and by extension of altruism) from the notion of sacrifice.
336	In it, he writes: Alms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand, and of a notion of sacrifice, on the other.
336	Generosity is an obligation, because Nemesis avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth of certain people who should rid themselves of it.
336	This is the ancient morality of the gift, which has become a principle of justice.
336	The gods and the spirits accept that the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children.
336	Compare Altruism (ethics) – perception of altruism as self-sacrifice.
336	Compare explanation of alms in various scriptures.
336	Evolutionary explanations In the science of ethology (the study of animal behaviour), and more generally in the study of social evolution, altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor.
336	In evolutionary psychology this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity, emergency aid, help to coalition partners, tipping, courtship gifts, production of public goods, and environmentalism.
336	Theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins.
336	Two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from game theory.
336	Some of the proposed mechanisms are: * Kin selection.
336	That animals and humans are more altruistic towards close kin than to distant kin and non-kin has been confirmed in numerous studies across many different cultures.
336	Even subtle cues indicating kinship may unconsciously increase altruistic behavior.
336	One kinship cue is facial resemblance.
336	One study found that slightly altering photographs so that they more closely resembled the faces of study participants increased the trust the participants expressed regarding depicted persons.
336	Another cue is having the same family name, especially if rare, and this has been found to increase helping behavior.
336	Another study found more cooperative behavior the greater the number the perceived kin in a group.
336	Using kinship terms in political speeches increased audience agreement with the speaker in one study.
336	This effect was especially strong for firstborns, who are typically close to their families.
336	Vested interests.
336	People are likely to suffer if their friends, allies, and similar social ingroups suffer or even disappear.
336	Helping such group members may therefore eventually benefit the altruist.
336	Making ingroup membership more noticeable increases cooperativeness.
336	Extreme self-sacrifice towards the ingroup may be adaptive if a hostile outgroup threatens to kill the entire ingroup.
336	Reciprocal altruism.
336	See also Reciprocity (evolution).
336	Direct reciprocity.
336	Research shows that it can be beneficial to help others if there is a chance that they can and will reciprocate the help.
336	The effective tit for tat strategy is one game theoretic example.
336	Many people seem to be following a similar strategy by cooperating if and only if others cooperate in return.
336	One consequence is that people are more cooperative if it is more likely that individuals will interact again in the future.
336	People tend to be less cooperative if they perceive that the frequency of helpers in the population is lower.
336	They tend to help less if they see non-cooperativeness by others and this effect tend to be stronger than the opposite effect of seeing cooperative behaviors.
336	Simply changing the cooperative framing of a proposal may increase cooperativeness such as calling it a "Community Game" instead of a "Wall Street Game."
336	A tendency towards reciprocity implies that people will feel obligated to respond if someone helps them.
336	This has been used by charities that give small gifts to potential donors hoping thereby to induce reciprocity.
336	Another method is to announce publicly that someone has given a large donation.
336	The tendency to reciprocate can even generalize so people become more helpful toward others in general after being helped.
336	On the other hand, people will avoid or even retaliate against those perceived not to be cooperating.
336	People sometimes mistakenly fail to help when they intended to, or their helping may not be noticed, which may cause unintended conflicts.
336	As such, it may be an optimal strategy to be slightly forgiving of and have a slightly generous interpretation of non-cooperation.
336	People are more likely to cooperate on a task if they can communicate with one another first.
336	This may be due to better assessments of cooperativeness or due to exchange of promises.
336	They are more cooperative if they can gradually build trust, instead of being asked to give extensive help immediately.
336	Direct reciprocity and cooperation in a group can be increased by changing the focus and incentives from intra-group competition to larger scale competitions such as between groups or against the general population.
336	Thus, giving grades and promotions based only on an individual's performance relative to a small local group, as is common, may reduce cooperative behaviors in the group.
336	Indirect reciprocity.
336	The avoidance of poor reciprocators and cheaters causes a person's reputation to become very important.
336	A person with a good reputation for reciprocity have a higher chance of receiving help even from persons they have had no direct interactions with previously.
336	Strong reciprocity.
336	A form of reciprocity where some individuals seem to spend more resources on cooperating and punishing than would be most beneficial as predicted by several established theories of altruism.
336	A number of theories have been proposed as explanations as well as criticisms regarding its existence.
336	Pseudo-reciprocity.
336	An organism behaves altruistically and the recipient does not reciprocate but has an increased chance of acting in a way that is selfish but also as a byproduct benefits the altruist.
336	Costly signaling and the handicap principle.
336	Since altruism takes away resources from the altruist it can be an "honest signal" of resource availability and the abilities needed to gather resources.
336	This may signal to others that the altruist is a valuable potential partner.
336	It may also be a signal of interactive and cooperative intentions since those not interacting further in the future gain nothing from the costly signaling.
336	It is unclear if costly signaling can indicate a long-term cooperative personality but people have increased trust for those who help.
336	Costly signaling is pointless if everyone has the same traits, resources, and cooperative intentions but become a potentially more important signal if the population increasingly varies on these characteristics.
336	Hunters widely sharing the meat has been seen as a costly signal of ability and research has found that good hunters have higher reproductive success and more adulterous relations even if they themselves receive no more of the hunted meat than anyone else.
336	Similarly, holding large feasts and giving large donations has been seen as ways of demonstrating one's resources.
336	Heroic risk-taking has also been interpreted as a costly signal of ability.
336	Both indirect reciprocity and costly signaling depend on the value of reputation and tend to make similar predictions.
336	One is that people will be more helping when they know that their helping behavior will be communicated to people they will interact with later, is publicly announced, is discussed, or is simply being observed by someone else.
336	This have been documented in many studies.
336	The effect is sensitive to subtle cues such as people being more helpful when there were stylized eyespots instead of a logo on a computer screen.
336	Weak reputational cues such as eyespots may become unimportant if there are stronger cues present and may lose their effect with continued exposure unless reinforced with real reputational effects.
336	Public displays such as public weeping for dead celebrities and participation in demonstrations may be influenced by a desire to be seen as altruistic.
336	People who know that they are publicly monitored sometimes even wastefully donate money they know are not needed by recipient which may be because of reputational concerns.
336	Women have been found to find altruistic men to be attractive partners.
336	When looking for a long-term partner more conventional altruism may be preferred which may indicate that he is also willing to share resources with her and her children while when looking for a short-term partner heroic risk-taking, which may be costly signal showing good genes, may be more preferable.
336	Men also perform more altruistic acts in the early stages of a romantic relationship or simply when in the presence of an attractive woman.
336	While both sexes state that kindness is the most preferable trait in a partner there is some evidence that men place less value on this than women and that women may not be more altruistic in presence of an attractive man.
336	Men may even avoid altruistic women in short-term relationships which may be because they expect less success.
336	People may compete over getting the benefits of a high reputation which may cause competitive altruism.
336	On other hand, in some experiments a proportion of people do not seem to care about reputation and they do not help more even if this is conspicuous.
336	This may possibly be due to reasons such as psychopathy or that they are so attractive that they need not be seen to be altruistic.
336	The reputational benefits of altruism occur in the future as compared to the immediate costs of altruism in the present.
336	While humans and other organisms generally place less value on future costs/benefits as compared to those in the present, some have shorter time horizons than others and these people tend to be less cooperative.
336	Explicit extrinsic rewards and punishments have been found to sometimes actually have opposite effects on behaviors.
336	This may be because such extrinsic, top-down incentives may undermine intrinsic and reputational incentives which overall may make the behaviors less desirable to do.
336	Another effect is that people would like altruism to be due to a personality characteristic rather than due to overt reputational concerns and simply pointing out that there are reputational benefits of an action may actually reduce them.
336	This may possibly be used as derogatory tactic against altruists, especially by those who are non-cooperators.
336	A counterargument is that doing good due to reputational concerns is better than doing no good at all.
336	Group selection.
336	It has controversially been argued by some evolutionary scientists such as E.
336	O.
336	Wilson that natural selection can act at the level of non-kin groups to produce adaptations that benefit a non-kin group even if these adaptions are detrimental at the individual level.
336	Thus, while altruistic persons may under some circumstances be outcompeted by less altruistic persons at the individual level, according to group selection theory the opposite may occur at the group level where groups consisting of the more altruistic persons may outcompete groups consisting of the less altruistic persons.
336	Such altruism may only extend to ingroup members while there may instead prejudice and antagonism against outgroup members (See also in-group favoritism).
336	Group selection theory has been criticized by many other evolutionary scientists.
336	Such explanations do not imply that humans are always consciously calculating how to increase their inclusive fitness when they are doing altruistic acts.
336	Instead, evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms, such as emotions, that promote altruistic behaviors.
336	Every single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive fitness; altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment.
336	This need not imply that on average 50% or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment; if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits.
336	The benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups.
336	Research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no-kin, to friends than to strangers, to those attractive than to those unattractive, to non-competitors than to competitors, and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup.
336	The study of altruism was the initial impetus behind George R.
336	Price's development of the Price equation, which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution.
336	An interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular slime moulds, such as Dictyostelium mucoroides.
336	These protists live as individual amoebae until starved, at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body.
336	Selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds, and associated emotional, cognitive, and neurohormonal mechanisms, evolved in order to facilitate long-term, high-cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success.
336	Such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left-wing politics such by the Russian zoologist and anarchist Peter Kropotkin in his 1902 book Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution and Peter Singer in his book A Darwinian Left.
336	Most recently, Jeremy Griffith has proposed a biological theory for the development of truly altruistic instincts that accommodates the biological imperative to reproduce, as evidenced by a moral conscience visible in humans today.
336	Neurobiology Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman, neuroscientists at the National Institutes of Health and LABS-D'Or Hospital Network (J.M.) provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers, using functional magnetic resonance imaging.
336	In their research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA in October, 2006, they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the mesolimbic reward pathway, a primitive part of the brain that usually lights up in response to food and sex.
336	However, when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations, another brain circuit was selectively activated: the subgenual cortex/septal region.
336	These structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species.
336	Altruism, the experiment suggested, was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain, hard-wired and pleasurable.
336	Another experiment funded by the National Institutes of Health and conducted in 2007 at the Duke University in Durham, North Carolina suggests a different view, "that altruistic behavior may originate from how people view the world rather than how they act in it."
336	In the study published in the February 2007 print issue of Nature Neuroscience, researchers have found a part of the brain that behaves differently for altruistic and selfish people.
336	The researchers invited 45 volunteers to play a computer game and also to watch the computer play the game.
336	In some rounds, the game resulted in the volunteers winning money for themselves, and in others it resulted in money being donated to a charity of the volunteer's choice.
336	During these activities, the researchers took functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of the participants' brains and were "surprised by the results".
336	Although they "were expecting to see activity in the brain's reward centers," based on the idea that "people perform altruistic acts because they feel good about it," what they found was that "another part of the brain was also involved, and it was quite sensitive to the difference between doing something for personal gain and doing it for someone else's gain."
336	That part of the brain is called the posterior superior temporal cortex (pSTC).
336	In the next stage, the scientists asked the participants some questions about type and frequency of their altruistic or helping behaviours.
336	They then analysed the responses to generate an estimate of a person's tendency to act altruistically and compared each person's level of altruism against their fMRI brain scan.
336	The results showed that pSTC activity rose in proportion to a person's self-reported level of altruism.
336	According to the researchers, the results suggest that altruistic behavior may originate from how people view the world rather than how they act in it.
336	"We believe that the ability to perceive other people's actions as meaningful is critical for altruism," said lead study investigator Dharol Tankersley.
336	Psychology The International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences defines psychological altruism as "a motivational state with the goal of increasing another’s welfare."
336	Psychological altruism is contrasted with psychological egoism, which refers to the motivation to increase one’s own welfare.
336	There has been some debate on whether or not humans are truly capable of psychological altruism.
336	Some definitions specify a self-sacrificial nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors.
336	However, because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases, the selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question.
336	The social exchange theory postulates that altruism only exists when benefits outweigh costs.
336	Daniel Batson is a psychologist who examined this question and argues against the social exchange theory.
336	He identified four major motives for altruism: altruism to ultimately benefit the self (egoism), to ultimately benefit the other person (altruism), to benefit a group (collectivism), or to uphold a moral principle (principlism).
336	Altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism, but the general conclusion has been that empathy-induced altruism can be genuinely selfless.
336	The empathy-altruism hypothesis basically states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering.
336	Feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress, which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions.
336	People with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided, whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to another's suffering.
336	Helping behavior is seen in humans at about two years old, when a toddler is capable of understanding subtle emotional cues.
336	In psychological research on altruism, studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping, comforting, sharing, cooperation, philanthropy, and community service.
336	Research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person's distress.
336	Research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping (the Bystander effect).
336	Greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility.
336	However, a witness with a high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders.
336	Many studies have observed the effects of volunteerism (as a form of altruism) on happiness and health and have consistently found a strong connection between volunteerism and current and future health and well-being.
336	In a study of older adults, those who volunteered were significantly higher on life satisfaction and will to live, and significantly lower in depression, anxiety, and somatization.
336	Volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health, but physical health and longevity as well.
336	One study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over a 30-year period and found that 52% of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only 36% of those who did volunteer experienced one.
336	A study on adults ages 55+ found that during the four-year study period, people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a 63% lower likelihood of dying.
336	After controlling for prior health status, it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a 44% reduction in mortality.
336	Merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater well-being.
336	A study that asked participants to count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness.
336	It is important to es361–375|doi 10.1007/s10902-00note that, while research supports the idea that altruistic acts bring about happiness, it has also been found to work in the opposite direction—that happier people are also kinder.
336	The relationship between altruistic behavior and happiness is bidirectional.
336	Studies have found that generosity increases linearly from sad to happy affective states.
336	Studies have also been careful to note that feeling over-taxed by the needs of others has conversely negative effects on health and happiness.
336	For example, one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others' demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one (although positive effects were still significant).
336	Additionally, while generous acts make people feel good about themselves, it is also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others.
336	Studies suggest that gratitude goes hand-in-hand with kindness and is also very important for our well-being.
336	A study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that “a conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in negative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals, positive affect, offering emotional support, sleep quality, and well-being.” Sociology "Sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society" ("Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity".
336	American Sociological Association.).
336	The structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable, philanthropic, and other pro-social, altruistic actions for the common good is a largely researched topic within the field.
336	The American Sociology Association (ASA) acknowledges Public sociology saying, "The intrinsic scientific, policy, and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct 'good societies' is unquestionable" ("Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity" ASA).
336	This type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized, and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies.
336	How altruism is framed, organized, carried out, and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and "build the good society".
336	Religious viewpoints Most, if not all, of the world's religions promote altruism as a very important moral value.
336	Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Jainism, Judaism and Sikhism, etc., place particular emphasis on altruistic morality.
336	Buddhism Altruism figures prominently in Buddhism.
336	Love and compassion are components of all forms of Buddhism, and are focused on all beings equally: love is the wish that all beings be happy, and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering.
336	"Many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion.
336	These qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness, and the need for them lies at the very core of our being" (Dalai Lama).
336	Since "all beings" includes the individual, love and compassion in Buddhism are outside the opposition between self and other.
336	It is even said that the distinction between self and other is part of the root cause of our suffering.
336	In practical terms, however, since most of us are spontaneously self-centered, Buddhism encourages us to focus love and compassion on others, and thus can be characterized as "altruistic."
336	Many would agree with the Dalai Lama that Buddhism as a religion is kindness toward others.
336	Still, the notion of altruism is modified in such a world-view, since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness: "The more we care for the happiness of others, the greater our own sense of well-being becomes" (Dalai Lama).
336	In the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment, Buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative (unhappy) consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment, but from the law of karma, which functions like a natural law of cause and effect.
336	A simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what I cause: if I cause suffering, then as a natural consequence I will experience suffering; if I cause happiness, then as a natural consequence I will experience happiness.
336	In Buddhism, karma (Pāli kamma) is strictly distinguished from vipāka, meaning "fruit" or "result".
336	Karma is categorized within the group or groups of cause (Pāli hetu) in the chain of cause and effect, where it comprises the elements of "volitional activities" (Pali sankhara) and "action" (Pali bhava).
336	Any action is understood to create "seeds" in the mind that sprout into the appropriate results (Pāli vipaka) when they meet the right conditions.
336	Most types of karmas, with good or bad results, will keep one in the wheel of samsāra; others will liberate one to nirvāna.
336	Buddhism relates karma directly to motives behind an action.
336	Motivation usually makes the difference between "good" and "bad", but motivation also includes the aspect of ignorance; so a well-intended action from an ignorant mind can easily be "bad" in that it creates unpleasant results for the "actor."
336	In Buddhism, karma is not the only cause of all that happens.
336	As taught in the early texts, the commentarial tradition classified causal mechanisms governing the universe in five categories, known as Niyama Dhammas: * Kamma Niyama — Consequences of one's actions * Utu Niyama — Seasonal changes and climate * Biija Niyama — Laws of heredity * Citta Niyama — Will of mind * Dhamma Niyama — Nature's tendency to produce a perfLaws of heredity * Citta Niyama — Wiect type Jainism The fundamental principles of Jainism revolve around the concept of altruism, not only for humans but for all sentient beings.
336	Jainism preaches the view of Ahimsa – to live and let live, thereby not harming sentient beings, i.e.
336	It also considers all living things to be equal.
336	The first Thirthankar, Rishabh introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings, from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation, giving oneself up for others, non-violence and compassion for all living things.
336	Jainism prescribes a path of non-violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal.
336	Jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation, one must practice the following ethical principles (major vows) in thought, speech and action.
336	The degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks.
336	They are: # Non-violence (Ahimsa); # Truthfulness (Satya); # Non-stealing (Asteya); # Celibacy (Brahmacharya); # Non-possession or non-materialism (Aparigraha); A major characteristic of Jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors.
336	One's unconquered mind with anger, pride (ego), deceit, greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans.
336	Anger spoils good relations, pride destroys humility, deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything.
336	Jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness, pride (ego) by humility, deceit by straight-forwardness and greed by contentment.
336	The principle of non-violence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul.
336	Jainism views every soul as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become Siddha (Param-atma – "highest soul").
336	Because all living beings possess a soul, great care and awareness is essential in one's actions.
336	Jainism emphasizes the equality of all life, advocating harmlessness towards all, whether the creatures are great or small.
336	This policy extends even to microscopic organisms.
336	Jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders.
336	The "great vows" (mahavrata) are prescribed for monks and "limited vows" (anuvrata) are prescribed for householders.
336	In other words, the house-holders are encouraged to practice the five cardinal principles of non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, celibacy and non-possessiveness with their current practical limitations while the monks have to observe them very strictly.
336	With consistent practice, it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually, accelerating the spiritual progress.
336	Christianity Altruism is central to the teachings of Jesus found in the Gospel, especially in the Sermon on the Mount and the Sermon on the Plain.
336	From biblical to medieval Christian traditions, tensions between self-affirmation and other-regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of "disinterested love", as in the Pauline phrase "love seeks not its own interests."
336	In his book Indoctrination and Self-deception, Roderick Hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self-affirmation and altruism, by analysis of other-regard within creative individuation of the self, and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many.
336	Love confirms others in their freedom, shuns propaganda and masks, assures others of its presence, and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others, but by each person's experience and practice from within.
336	As in practical arts, the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone, but in the making of the connection.
336	St Thomas Aquinas in the Summa Theologica, II:II Quaestio 25, Article 4 states that we should love our neighbour more than our ourselves.
336	His interpretation of the Pauline phrase is that we should seek the common good more than the private good, but this is because the common good is a more desirable good for the individual.
336	St Thomas interprets 'You should love your neighbour as yourself' from Leviticus 19 and Matthew 22 as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others.
336	However, he thinks we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbours, and more than our bodily life—since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude: a more desirable thing than bodily well being.
336	In coining the word Altruism, as stated above, Comte was probably opposing this Thomistic doctrine, which is present in some theological schools within Catholicism.
336	Many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of God.
336	John 4 states that for one to love God one must love his fellowman, and that hatred of one's fellowman is the same as hatred of God.
336	Thomas Jay Oord has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love.
336	An altruistic action is not always a loving action.
336	Oord defines altruism as acting for the other's good, and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one's own good when the other's demands undermine overall well-being.
336	German philosopher Max Scheler distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak.
336	One way is a sincere expression of Christian love, "motivated by a powerful feeling of security, strength, and inner salvation, of the invincible fullness of one’s own life and existence".
336	Another way is merely "one of the many modern substitutes for love, ...
336	" At its worst, Scheler says, "love for the small, the poor, the weak, and the oppressed is really disguised hatred, repressed envy, an impulse to detract, etc., directed against the opposite phenomena: wealth, strength, power, largesse."
336	Islam and Sufism In Sufism, the concept 'īṯār' (altruism) is the notion of 'preferring others to oneself'.
336	For Sufis, this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one's own concerns.
336	The importance lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good; Islam considers those practicing īṯār as abiding by the highest degree of nobility.
336	This is similar to the notion of chivalry, but unlike that European concept, in i'thar attention is focused on everything in existence.
336	A constant concern for Allah (i.e.
336	God) results in a careful attitude towards people, animals, and other things in this world.
336	This concept was emphasized by Sufi mystics like Rabia al-Adawiyya who paid attention to the difference between dedication to Allah (i.e.
336	God) and dedication to people.
336	Thirteenth-century Turkish sufi poet Yunus Emre explained this philosophy as "Yaratılanı severiz, Yaratandan ötürü" or We love the creature, because of The Creator.
336	For many Muslims, i'thar must be practiced as a religious obligation during specific Islamic holidays.
336	However, i'thar is also still an Islamic ideal to which all Muslims should strivc Islamic holidays.
336	However, i'thar is ale to adhere at all times.
336	Judaism Judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation.
336	The famous Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity.
336	This is defined as bestowal, or giving, which is the intention of altruism.
336	This can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or God.
336	Kabbalah defines God as the force of giving in existence.
336	Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto in particular focused on the 'purpose of creation' and how the will of God was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force.
336	Modern Kabbalah developed by Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag, in his writings about the future generation, focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework.
336	Ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation, and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism, love for one another.
336	Ashlag focused on society and its relation to divinity.
336	Sikhism Altruism is essential to the Sikh religion.
336	The central faith in Sikhism is that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love, affection, sacrifice, patience, harmony, truthfulness.
336	The fifth Nanak, Guru Arjun Dev Sacrificed his life to uphold 22 Carats of pure truth, the greatest gift to humanity, the Guru Granth.
336	The Ninth Nanak, Guru Tegh Bahadur Sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity.
336	In the late 17th century, Guru Gobind Singh Ji (the tenth guru in Sikhism), was in war with the Moghul rulers to protect the people of different faiths, when a fellow Sikh, Bhai Kanhaiya, attended the troops of the enemy.
336	He gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield.
336	Some of the enemy began to fight again and some Sikh warriors were annoyed by Bhai Kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy.
336	Sikh soldiers brought Bhai Kanhaiya before Guru Gobind Singh Ji, and complained of his action that they considered counterproductive to their struggle on the battlefield.
336	"What were you doing, and why?"
336	Guru.
336	"I was giving water to the wounded because I saw your face in all of them," replied Bhai Kanhaiya.
336	The Guru responded, "Then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds.
336	You were practicing what you were coached in the house of the Guru."
336	It was under the tutelage of the Guru that Bhai Kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism.
336	This volunteer corps still to date is engaged in doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same.
336	Hinduism Advaita Vedanta differs from the view that karma is a law of cause and effect but instead additionally hold that karma is mediated by the will of a personal supreme god.
336	This view of karma is in contradiction to Buddhism, Jainism and other Indian religions that do view karma as a law of cause and effect.
336	Swami Sivananda, an Advaita scholar, reiterates the same views in his commentary synthesising Vedanta views on the Brahma Sutras, a Vedantic text.
336	In his commentary on Chapter 3 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short-lived, and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed.
336	Hence, karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one's merit.
336	Furthermore, one cannot argue that karma generates apurva or punya, which gives fruit.
336	Since apurva is non-sentient, it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as a god.
336	It cannot independently bestow reward or punishment.
336	Philosophy There exists a wide range of philosophical views on man's obligations or motivations to act altruistically.
336	Proponents of ethical altruism maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically.
336	The opposing view is ethical egoism, which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self-interest.
336	Both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with utilitarianism, which is the view that every individual's well-being (including one's own) is of equal moral importance.
336	A related concept in descriptive ethics is psychological egoism, the thesis that humans always act in their own self-interest and that true altruism is impossible.
336	Rational egoism is the view that rationality consists in acting in one's self-interest (without specifying how this affects one's moral obligations).
339	Ayn Rand (; born Alisa Zinov'yevna Rosenbaum;  – March 6, 1982) was a Russian-American novelist, philosopher, playwright, and screenwriter.
339	She is known for her two best-selling novels, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, and for developing a philosophical system she called Objectivism.
339	Born and educated in Russia, Rand moved to the United States in 1926.
339	She worked as a screenwriter in Hollywood and had a play produced on Broadway in 1935–1936.
339	After two early novels that were initially less successful, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel The Fountainhead.
339	In 1957, she published her best-known work, the novel Atlas Shrugged.
339	Afterward she turned to nonfiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own magazines and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982.
339	Rand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge and rejected faith and religion.
339	She supported rational and ethical egoism, and rejected ethical altruism.
339	In politics, she condemned the initiation of force as immoral and  opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism, instead supporting a minarchist limited government and laissez-faire capitalism, which she believed was the only social system that protected individual rights.
339	In art, Rand promoted romantic realism.
339	She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for some Aristotelians and classical liberals.
339	Rand's fiction was poorly received by many literary critics, and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy.
339	The Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas, both to the public and in academic settings.
339	She has been a significant influence among libertarians and American conservatives.
339	Life Early life Rand was born Alisa Zinov'yevna Rosenbaum () on February 2, 1905, to a bourgeois family living in Saint Petersburg.
339	She was the eldest of the three daughters of Zinovy Zakharovich Rosenbaum and his wife, Anna Borisovna (née Kaplan), largely non-observant Jews.
339	Zinovy Rosenbaum was a successful pharmacist, eventually owning a pharmacy and the building in which it was located.
339	Rand found school unchallenging, and said she began writing screenplays at the age of eight and novels at the age of ten.
339	She was twelve at the time of the February Revolution of 1917, during which she favored Alexander Kerensky over Tsar Nicholas II.
339	The subsequent October Revolution and the rule of the Bolsheviks under Vladimir Lenin disrupted the comfortable life the family had previously enjoyed.
339	Her father’s pharmacy business was confiscated and the family displaced.
339	They fled to the Crimea, which was initially under control of the White Army during the Russian Civil War.
339	She later recalled that while in high school she determined that she was an atheist and that she valued reason above any other human virtue.
339	After graduating from high school in the Crimea at 16, Rand returned with her family to Petrograd (the new name for Saint Petersburg), where they faced desperate conditions, on occasion nearly starving.
339	After the Russian Revolution, universities were opened to women, allowing Rand to be in the first group of women to enroll at Petrograd State University, where she studied in the department of social pedagogy, majoring in history.
339	At the university she was introduced to the writings of Aristotle and Plato, who would be her greatest influence and counter-influence, respectively.
339	A third figure whose philosophical works she studied heavily was Friedrich Nietzsche.
339	Able to read French, German and Russian, Rand also discovered the writers Fyodor Dostoevsky, Victor Hugo, Edmond Rostand, and Friedrich Schiller, who became her perennial favorites.
339	Along with many other "bourgeois" students, Rand was purged from the university shortly before graduating.
339	However, after complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists, many of the purged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate, which Rand did in October 1924.
339	She subsequently studied for a year at the State Technicum for Screen Arts in Leningrad.
339	For one of her assignments, she wrote an essay about the Polish actress Pola Negri, which became her first published work.
339	By this time she had decided her professional surname for writing would be Rand, possibly as a Cyrillic contraction of her birth surname, and she adopted the first name Ayn, either from a Finnish name or from the Hebrew word  (ayin, meaning "eye").
339	Arrival in America  In the fall of 1925, Rand was granted a visa to visit American relatives.
339	Rand was so impressed with the skyline of Manhattan upon her arrival in New York Harbor that she cried what she later called "tears of splendor".
339	Intent on staying in the United States to become a screenwriter, she lived for a few months with relatives in Chicago, one of whom owned a movie theater and allowed her to watch dozens of films for free.
339	She then set out for Hollywood, California.
339	Initially, Rand struggled in Hollywood and took odd jobs to pay her basic living expenses.
339	A chance meeting with famed director Cecil B.
339	DeMille led to a job as an extra in his film, The King of Kings, and to subsequent work as a junior screenwriter.
339	While working on The King of Kings, she met an aspiring young actor, Frank O'Connor; the two were married on April 15, 1929.
339	Rand became an American citizen in 1931.
339	Taking various jobs during the 1930s to support her writing, Rand worked for a time as the head of the costume department at RKO Studios.
339	She made several attempts to bring her parents and sisters to the United States, but they were unable to acquire permission to emigrate.
339	Early fiction Rand's first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay Red Pawn to Universal Studios in 1932, although it was never produced.
339	This was followed by the courtroom drama Night of January 16th, first produced by E.E.
339	Clive in Hollywood in 1934 and then successfully reopened on Broadway in 1935.
339	Each night the "jury" was selected from members of the audience, and one of the two different endings, depending on the jury's "verdict", would then be pe and one of the two different endings, depending on the jury's "verdictrformed.
339	In 1941, Paramount Pictures produced a movie version of the play.
339	Rand did not participate in the production and was highly critical of the result.
339	Rand's first novel, the semi-autobiographical We the Living, was published in 1936.
339	Set in Soviet Russia, it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state.
339	In a 1959 foreword to the novel, Rand stated that We the Living "is as near to an autobiography as I will ever write.
339	It is not an autobiography in the literal, but only in the intellectual sense.
339	The plot is invented, the background is not..."
339	Initial sales were slow and the American publisher let it go out of print, although European editions continued to sell.
339	After the success of her later novels, Rand was able to release a revised version in 1959 that has since sold over three million copies.
339	Without Rand's knowledge or permission, the novel was made into a pair of Italian films, Noi vivi and Addio, Kira, in 1942.
339	Rediscovered in the 1960s, these films were re-edited into a new version which was approved by Rand and re-released as We the Living in 1986.
339	Her novella Anthem was written during a break from the writing of her next major novel, The Fountainhead.
339	It presents a vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even the word 'I' has been forgotten and replaced with 'we'.
339	It was published in England in 1938, but Rand initially could not find an American publisher.
339	As with We the Living, Rand's later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946, which has sold more than 3.5 million copies.
339	The Fountainhead and political activism During the 1940s, Rand became politically active.
339	Both she and her husband worked full-time in volunteer positions for the 1940 presidential campaign of Republican Wendell Willkie.
339	This work led to Rand's first public speaking experiences, including fielding the sometimes hostile questions from New York City audiences who had just viewed pro-Willkie newsreels, an experience she greatly enjoyed.
339	This activity also brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to free-market capitalism.
339	She became friends with journalist Henry Hazlitt and his wife, and Hazlitt introduced her to the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises.
339	Despite her philosophical differences with them, Rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career, and both of them expressed admiration for her.
339	Once Mises referred to Rand as "the most courageous man in America", a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said "man" instead of "woman".
339	Rand also developed a friendship with libertarian writer Isabel Paterson.
339	Rand questioned the well-informed Paterson about American history and politics long into the night during their numerous meetings and gave Paterson ideas for her only nonfiction book, The God of the Machine.
339	Rand's first major success as a writer came with The Fountainhead in 1943, a romantic and philosophical novel that she wrote over a period of seven years.
339	The novel centers on an uncompromising young architect named Howard Roark and his struggle against what Rand described as "second-handers"—those who attempt to live through others, placing others above self.
339	It was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the Bobbs-Merrill Company on the insistence of editor Archibald Ogden, who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it.
339	While completing the novel, Rand was prescribed the amphetamine Benzedrine to fight fatigue.
339	The drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the finished novel, but when the book was done, she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks' rest.
339	Her continued use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings.
339	The Fountainhead eventually became a worldwide success, bringing Rand fame and financial security.
339	In 1943, Rand sold the rights for a film version to Warner Bros., and she returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay.
339	Finishing her work on that screenplay, she was hired by producer Hal Wallis as a screenwriter and script-doctor.
339	Her work for Wallis included the screenplays for the Oscar-nominated Love Letters and You Came Along.
339	This role gave Rand time to work on other projects, including a planned nonfiction treatment of her philosophy to be called The Moral Basis of Individualism.
339	Although the planned book was never completed, a condensed version was published as an essay titled "The Only Path to Tomorrow", in the January 1944 edition of Reader's Digest magazine.
339	While working in Hollywood, Rand extended her involvement with free-market and anti-communist activism.
339	She became involved with the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, a Hollywood anti-Communist group, and wrote articles on the group's behalf.
339	She also joined the anti-Communist American Writers Association.
339	A visit by Isabel Paterson to meet with Rand's California associates led to a final falling out between the two when Paterson made comments that Rand saw as rude to valued political allies.
339	In 1947, during the Second Red Scare, Rand testified as a "friendly witness" before the United States House Un-American Activities Committee.
339	Her testimony described the disparity between her personal experiences in the Soviet Union and the portrayal of it in the 1944 film Song of Russia.
339	Rand argued that the film grossly misrepresented conditions in the Soviet Union, portraying life there as being much better and happier than it actually was.
339	She wanted to also criticize the lauded 1946 film The Best Years of Our Lives for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world, but she was not allowed to testify about it.
339	When asked after the hearings about her feelings on the effectiveness of the investigations, Rand described the process as "futile".
339	After several delays, the film version of The Fountainhead was released in 1949.
339	Although it used Rand's screenplay with minimal alterations, she "disliked the movie from beginning to end", complaining about its editing, acting, and other elements.
339	Atlas Shrugged and Objectivism In the years following the publication of The Fountainhead, Rand received numerous letters from readers, some of whom it profoundly influenced.
339	In 1951 Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City, where she gathered a group of these admirers around her.
339	This group (jokingly designated "The Collective") included future Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal (later Nathaniel Branden) and his wife Barbara, and Barbara's cousin Leonard Peikoff.
339	At first the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy.
339	Later she began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel, Atlas Shrugged, as the manuscript pages were written.
339	In 1954 Rand's close relationship with the younger Nathaniel Branden turned into a romantic affair, with the consent of their spouses.
339	Atlas Shrugged, published in 1957, was Rand's magnum opus.
339	Rand described the theme of the novel as "the role of the mind in man's existence—and, as a corollary, the demonstration of a new moral philosophy: the morality of rational self-interest."
339	It advocates the core tenets of Rand's philosophy of Objectivism and expresses her concept of human achievement.
339	The plot involves a dystopian United States in which the most creative industrialists, scientists and artists go on strike and retreat to a mountainous hideaway where they build an independent free economy.
339	The novel's hero and leader of the strike, John Galt, describes the strike as "stopping the motor of the world" by withdrawing the minds of the individuals most contributing to the nation's wealth and achievement.
339	With this fictional strike, Rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive, the economy would collapse and society would fall apart.
339	The novel includes elements of romance, mystery, and science fiction, and it contains Rand's most extensive statement of Objectivism in any of her works of fiction, a lengthy monologue delivered by Galt.
339	Despite many negative reviews, Atlas Shrugged became an international bestseller, and in an interview with Mike Wallace, Rand declared herself "the most creative thinker alive".
339	After completing the novel, Rand fell into a severe depression.
339	Atlas Shrugged was Rand's last completed work of fiction; a turning point in her life, it marked the end of Rand's career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher.
339	In 1958 Nathaniel Branden established Nathaniel Branden Lectures, later incorporated as the Nathaniel Branden Institute (NBI), to promote Rand's philosophy.
339	Collective members gave lectures for NBI and wrote articles for Objectivist periodicals that she edited.
339	Rand later published some of these articles in book form.
339	Critics, including some former NBI students and Branden himself, have described the culture of NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand, with some describing NBI or the Objectivist movement itself as a cult or religion.
339	Rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics, from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair, and some of her followers mimicked her preferences, wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers.
339	Rand was unimpressed with many of the NBI students and held them to strict standards, sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her.
339	However, some former NBI students believe the extent of these behaviors has been exaggerated, with the problem being concentrated among Rand's closest followers in New York.
339	Later years Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at institutions such as Yale, Princeton, Columbia,  Harvard, and MIT.
339	She received an honorary doctorate from Lewis & Clark College in 1963.
339	She also began delivering annual lectures at the Ford Hall Forum, responding afterward to questions from the audience.
339	During these speeches and Q&A sessions, she often took controversial stances on political and social issues of the day.
339	These included supporting abortion rights, opposing the Vietnam War and the military draft (but condemning many draft dodgers as "bums"), supporting Israel in the Arab-Israeli War of 1973 against Palestinians and Arabs as "civilized men fighting savages", saying European colonists had the right to take land from American Indians, and calling homosexuality "immoral" and "disgusting", while also advocating the repeal of all laws against it.
339	She also endorsed several Republican candidates for President of the United States, most strongly Barry Goldwater in 1964, whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for The Objectivist Newsletter.
339	In 1964 Nathaniel Branden began an affair with the young actress Patrecia Scott, whom he later married.
339	Nathaniel and Barbara Branden kept the affair hidden from Rand.
339	When she learned of it in 1968, though her romantic relationship with Branden had already ended, Rand terminated her relationship with both Brandens, which led to the closure of NBI.
339	Rand published an article in The Objectivist repudiating Nathaniel Branden for dishonesty and other "irrational behavior in his private life".
339	Branden later apologized in an interview to "every student of Objectivism" for "perpetuating the Ayn Rand mystique" and for "contributing to that dreadful atmosphere of intellectual repressiveness that pervades the Objectivist movement."
339	In subsequent years, Rand and several more of her closest associates parted company.
339	Rand underwent surgery for lung cancer in 1974 after decades of heavy smoking.
339	In 1976 she retired from writing her newsletter and, despite her initial objections, was persuaded to allow Evva Pryor, a consultant from her attorney's office, to sign her up for Social Security and Medicare.
339	During the late 1970s her activities within the Objectivist movement declined, especially after the death of her husband on November 9, 1979.
339	One of her final projects was work on a never-completed television adaptation of Atlas Shrugged.
339	Rand died of heart failure on March 6, 1982, at her home in New York City, and was interred in the Kensico Cemetery, Valhalla, New York.
339	Rand's funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers, including Alan Greenspan.
339	A six-foot floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket.
339	In her will, Rand named Leonard Peikoff the heir to her estate.
339	Philosophy Rand called her philosophy "Objectivism", describing its essence as "the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute."
339	She considered Objectivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy and esthetics.
339	In metaphysics, Rand supported philosophical realism, and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism, including all forms of religion.
339	In epistemology, she considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception, the validity of which she considered axiomatic, and reason, which she described as "the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man's senses".
339	She rejected all claims of non-perceptual or a priori knowledge, including "'instinct,' 'intuition,' 'revelation,' or any form of 'just knowing.'" In her Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology, Rand presented a theory of concept formation and endorsed the rejection of the analytic–synthetic dichotomy.
339	In ethics, Rand argued for rational egoism (rational self-interest), as the guiding moral principle.
339	She said the individual should "exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself".
339	She referred to egoism as "the virtue of selfishness" in her book of that title, in which she presented her solution to the is-ought problem by describing a meta-ethical theory that based morality in the needs of "man's survival qua man".
339	She condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness, and held that the initiation of force was evil and irrational, writing in Atlas Shrugged that "Force and mind are opposites".
339	Rand's political philosophy emphasized individual rights (including property rights), and she considered laissez-faire capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights.
339	She opposed statism, which she understood to include theocracy, absolute monarchy, Nazism, fascism, communism, democratic socialism, and dictatorship.
339	Rand believed that rights should be enforced by a constitutionally limited government.
339	Although her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian, she preferred the term "radical for capitalism".
339	She worked with conservatives on political projects, but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics.
339	She denounced libertarianism, which she associated with anarchism.
339	She rejected anarchism as a naïve theory based in subjectivism that could only lead to collectivism in practice.
339	Rand's esthetics defined art as a "selective re-creation of reality according to an artist's metaphysical value-judgments".
339	According to Rand, art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be easily grasped, thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness.
339	As a writer, the art form Rand focused on most closely was literature, where she considered Romanticism to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human free will.
339	She described her own approach to literature as "romantic realism".
339	Rand acknowledged Aristotle as her greatest influence and remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend "three A's"—Aristotle, Aquinas, and Ayn Rand.
339	Indeed her debt to Aristotle was so great that in a 1959 interview with Mike Wallace, when asked where her philosophy came from, she responded: "Out of my own mind, with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to Aristotle who is the only philosopher who ever influenced me.
339	I devised the rest of my philosophy myself."
339	However, she also found early inspiration in Friedrich Nietzsche, and scholars have found indications of his influence in early notes from Rand's journals, in passages from the first edition of We the Living (which Rand later revised), and in her overall writing style.
339	However, by the time she wrote The Fountainhead, Rand had turned against Nietzsche's ideas, and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed.
339	Among the philosophers Rand held in particular disdain was Immanuel Kant, whom she referred to as a "monster", although philosophers George Walsh and Fred Seddon have argued that she misinterpreted Kant and exaggerated their differences.
339	Rand said her most important contributions to philosophy were her "theory of concepts, [her] ethics, and [her] discovery in politics that evil—the violation of rights—consists of the initiation of force".
339	She believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy, stating, "I am not primarily an advocate of capitalism, but of egoism; and I am not primarily an advocate of egoism, but of reason.
339	If one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently, all the rest follows."
339	Reception and legacy Reviews During Rand's lifetime, her work evoked both extreme praise and condemnation.
339	Rand's first novel, We the Living, was admired by the literary critic H.L.
339	Mencken, her Broadway play Night of January 16th was both a critical and popular success, and The Fountainhead was hailed by a reviewer in The New York Times as "masterful".
339	Rand's novels were derided by some critics when they were first published as being long and melodramatic.
339	However, they became bestsellers largely through word of mouth.
339	The first reviews Rand received were for Night of January 16th.
339	Reviews of the production were largely positive, but Rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer.
339	Rand believed that her first novel, We the Living, was not widely reviewed, but Rand scholar Michael S.
339	Berliner says "it was the most reviewed of any of her works", with approximately 125 different reviews being published in more than 200 publications.
339	Overall these reviews were more positive than the reviews she received for her later work.
339	Her 1938 novella Anthem received little attention from reviewers, both for its first publication in England and for subsequent re-issues.
339	Rand's first bestseller, The Fountainhead, received far fewer reviews than We the Living, and reviewers' opinions were mixed.
339	There was a positive review in The New York Times that Rand greatly appreciated.
339	The reviewer called Rand "a writer of great power" who wrote "brilliantly, beautifully and bitterly", and stated that "you will not be able to read this masterful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time".
339	There were other positive reviews, but Rand dismissed most of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications.
339	Some negative reviews focused on the length of the novel, such as one that called it "a whale of a book" and another that said "anyoquot;/> such as one that called it "a ne who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paper-rationing".
339	Other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and Rand's style "offensively pedestrian".
339	Rand's 1957 novel Atlas Shrugged was widely reviewed, and many of the reviews were strongly negative.
339	In the National Review, conservative author Whittaker Chambers called the book "sophomoric" and "remarkably silly".
339	He described the tone of the book as "shrillness without reprieve" and accused Rand of supporting a Godless system (which he related to that of the Soviets), claiming "From almost any page of Atlas Shrugged, a voice can be heard, from painful necessity, commanding: 'To a gas chamber—go!
339	Atlas Shrugged received positive reviews from a few publications, including praise from the noted book reviewer John Chamberlain, but Rand scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein later wrote that "reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest put-downs", calling it "execrable claptrap" and "a nightmare"; they said it was "written out of hate" and showed "remorseless hectoring and prolixity".
339	Author Flannery O'Connor wrote in a letter to a friend that "The fiction of Ayn Rand is as low as you can get re fiction.
339	I hope you picked it up off the floor of the subway and threw it in the nearest garbage pail."
339	Rand's nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels had.
339	The tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book, For the New Intellectual, was similar to that for Atlas Shrugged, with philosopher Sidney Hook likening her certainty to "the way philosophy is written in the Soviet Union", and author Gore Vidal calling her viewpoint "nearly perfect in its immorality".
339	Her subsequent books got progressively less attention from reviewers.
339	On the 100th anniversary of Rand's birth in 2005, Edward Rothstein, writing for The New York Times, referred to her fictional writing as quaint utopian "retro fantasy" and programmatic neo-Romanticism of the misunderstood artist, while criticizing her characters' "isolated rejection of democratic society".
339	In 2007, book critic Leslie Clark described her fiction as "romance novels with a patina of pseudo-philosophy".
339	In 2009, GQs critic columnist Tom Carson described her books as "capitalism's version of middlebrow religious novels" such as Ben-Hur and the Left Behind series.
339	Popular interest In 1991, a survey conducted for the Library of Congress and the Book-of-the-Month Club asked club members what the most influential book in the respondent's life was.
339	Rand's Atlas Shrugged was the second most popular choice, after the Bible.
339	Rand's books continue to be widely sold and read, with 25 million copies sold as of 2007 and another 500,000 sold and 300,000 donated by the Ayn Rand Institute in 2008.
339	Although Rand's influence has been greatest in the United States, there has been international interest in her work.
339	Rand's work continues to be among the top sellers among books in India.
339	Rand's contemporary admirers included fellow novelists, such as Ira Levin, Kay Nolte Smith and L.
339	Neil Smith, and later writers such as Erika Holzer and Terry Goodkind have been influenced by her.
339	Other artists who have cited Rand as an important influence on their lives and thought include comic book artist Steve Ditko and musician Neil Peart of Rush.
339	Rand provided a positive view of business, and in response business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work.
339	John Allison of BB&T and Ed Snider of Comcast Spectacor have funded the promotion of Rand's ideas, while Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, and John P.
339	Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods, among others, have said they consider Rand crucial to their success.
339	Rand and her works have been referred to in a variety of media: on television shows including animated sitcoms, live-action comedies, dramas, and game shows, as well as in movies and video games.
339	She, or characters based on her, figure prominently (in positive and negative lights) in literary and science fiction novels by prominent American authors.
339	Nick Gillespie, editor in chief of Reason, has remarked that "Rand's is a tortured immortality, one in which she's as likely to be a punch line as a protagonist..."
339	"jibes at Rand as cold and inhuman, run through the popular culture".
339	Two movies have been made about Rand's life.
339	A 1997 documentary film, Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life, was nominated for the Academy Award for Documentary Feature.
339	The Passion of Ayn Rand, a 1999 television adaptation of the book of the same name, won several awards.
339	Rand's image also appears on a U.S.
339	Nick Gaetano.
339	Political influence Although she rejected the labels "conservative" and "libertarian", Rand has had continuing influence on right-wing politics and libertarianism.
339	Jim Powell, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, considers Rand one of the three most important women (along with Rose Wilder Lane and Isabel Paterson) of modern American libertarianism, and David Nolan, one of the founders of the Libertarian Party, stated that "without Ayn Rand, the libertarian movement would not exist".
339	In his history of the libertarian movement, journalist Brian Doherty described her as "the most influential libertarian of the twentieth century to the public at large", and biographer Jennifer Burns referred to her as "the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right".
339	She faced intense opposition from William F.
339	Buckley, Jr.
339	National Review magazine.
339	They published numerous criticisms in the 1950s and 1960s by Whittaker Chambers, Garry Wills, and M.
339	Stanton Evans.
339	Nevertheless, her influence among conservatives forced Buckley and other National Review contributors to reconsider how traditional notions of virtue and Christianity could be integrated with support for capitalism.
339	The political figures who cite Rand as an influence are usually conservatives (often members of the United States Republican Party), despite Rand taking some positions that are atypical for conservatives, such as being pro-choice and an atheist.
339	A 1987 article in The New York Times referred to h--DASHBot--> |der as the Reagan administration's "novelist laureate".
339	Republican Congressmen and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence on their lives and recommended her novels.
339	The late-2000s financial crisis spurred renewed interest in her works, especially Atlas Shrugged, which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis, and opinion articles compared real-world events with the plot of the novel.
339	During this time, signs mentioning Rand and her fictional hero John Galt appeared at Tea Party protests.
339	There was also increased criticism of her ideas, especially from the political left, with critics blaming the economic crisis on her support of selfishness and free markets, particularly through her influence on Alan Greenspan.
339	For example, Mother Jones remarked that "Rand's particular genius has always been her ability to turn upside down traditional hierarchies and recast the wealthy, the talented, and the powerful as the oppressed", while The Nation alleged similarities between the "moral syntax of Randianism" and fascism.
339	Academic reaction During Rand's lifetime her work received little attention from academic scholars.
339	When the first academic book about Rand's philosophy appeared in 1971, its author declared writing about Rand "a treacherous undertaking" that could lead to "guilt by association" for taking her seriously.
339	A few articles about Rand's ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in 1982, many of them in The Personalist.
339	One of these was "On the Randian Argument" by libertarian philosopher Robert Nozick, who argued that her meta-ethical argument is unsound and fails to solve the is–ought problem posed by David Hume.
339	Some responses to Nozick by other academic philosophers were also published in The Personalist arguing that Nozick misstated Rand's case.
339	Academic consideration of Rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited.
339	Academic Mimi Gladstein was unable to find any scholarly articles about Rand's novels when she began researching her in 1973, and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the 1970s.
339	Since Rand's death, interest in her work has gradually increased.
339	Historian Jennifer Burns has identified "three overlapping waves" of scholarly interest in Rand, the most recent of which is "an explosion of scholarship" since the year 2000.
339	However, few universities currently include Rand or Objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area, with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study.
339	Gladstein, Chris Matthew Sciabarra, Allan Gotthelf, Edwin A.
339	Locke and Tara Smith have taught her work in academic institutions.
339	Sciabarra co-edits the Journal of Ayn Rand Studies, a nonpartisan peer-reviewed journal dedicated to the study of Rand's philosophical and literary work.
339	In 1987 Gotthelf helped found the Ayn Rand Society with George Walsh and David Kelley, and has been active in sponsoring seminars about Rand and her ideas.
339	Smith has written several academic books and papers on Rand's ideas, including Ayn Rand's Normative Ethics: The Virtuous Egoist, a volume on Rand's ethical theory published by Cambridge University Press.
339	Rand's ideas have also been made subjects of study at Clemson and Duke universities.
339	Scholars of English and American literature have largely ignored her work, although attention to her literary work has increased since the 1990s.
339	Rand scholars Douglas Den Uyl and Douglas B.
339	Rasmussen, while stressing the importance and originality of her thought, describe her style as "literary, hyperbolic and emotional".
339	Philosopher Jack Wheeler says that despite "the incessant bombast and continuous venting of Randian rage", Rand's ethics are "a most immense achievement, the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought."
339	In the Literary Encyclopedia entry for Rand written in 2001, John David Lewis declared that "Rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation".
339	In a 1999 interview in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Sciabarra commented, "I know they laugh at Rand", while forecasting a growth of interest in her work in the academic community.
339	Philosopher Michael Huemer has argued that very few people find Rand's ideas convincing, especially her ethics, which he believes is difficult to interpret and may lack logical coherence.
339	He attributes the attention she receives to her being a "compelling writer", especially as a novelist.
339	Thus, Atlas Shrugged outsells not only the works of other philosophers of classical liberalism as Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, or Frederic Bastiat, but also Rand's own non-fiction works.
339	Political scientist Charles Murray, while praising Rand's literary accomplishments, criticizes her claim that her only "philosophical debt" was to Aristotle, instead asserting that her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as John Locke and Friedrich Nietzsche.
339	According to Murray, "By insisting that Objectivism had sprung full blown from her own mind, with just a little help from Aristotle, Rand was being childish, as well as out of touch with reality."
339	Although Rand maintained that Objectivism was an integrated philosophical system, philosopher Robert H.
339	Bass has argued that her central ethical ideas are inconsistent and contradictory to her central political ideas.
339	Objectivist movement In 1985, Rand's heir Leonard Peikoff established the Ayn Rand Institute, a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting Rand's ideas and works.
339	In 1990, philosopher David Kelley founded the Institute for Objectivist Studies, now known as The Atlas Society.
339	In 2001 historian John McCaskey organized the Anthem Foundation for Objectivist Scholarship, which provides grants for scholarly work on Objectivism in academia.
339	The charitable foundation of BB&T Corporation has also given grants for teaching Rand's ideas or works.
339	The University of Texas at Austin, the University of Pittsburgh, and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill are among the schools that have received grants.
339	In some cases these grants have been controversial due to their requiring research or teaching related to Rand.

344	Allan Dwan (April 3, 1885 – December 28, 1981) was a pioneering Canadian-born American motion picture director, producer and screenwriter.
344	Early life Born Joseph Aloysius Dwan in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Dwan moved with his family to the United States when he was 11 years old.
344	At the University of Notre Dame, he trained as an engineer and began working for a lighting company in Chicago.
344	However, he had a strong interest in the fledgling motion picture industry and when Essanay Studios offered him the opportunity to become a scriptwriter, he took the job.
344	At that time, some of the East Coast movie makers began to spend winters in California where the climate allowed them to continue productions requiring warm weather.
344	Soon, a number of movie companies worked there year-round and, in 1911, Dwan began working part-time in Hollywood.
344	While still in New York, in 1917 he was the founding president of the East Coast chapter of the Motion Picture Directors Association.
344	Career Dwan operated Flying A Studios in La Mesa, California from August, 1911 to July, 1912.
344	Flying A was one of the first motion pictures studios in California history.
344	On August 12, 2011, a plaque was unveiled on the Wolff building at Third Ave and La Mesa Bl commemorating Dwan and the Flying A Studios origins in La Mesa, California.
344	After making a series of westerns and comedies, Dwan directed fellow Canadian Mary Pickford in several very successful movies as well as her husband, Douglas Fairbanks, notably in the acclaimed 1922 Robin Hood.
344	Following the introduction of the talkies, in 1937 he directed child-star Shirley Temple in Heidi and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm the following year.
344	Dwan also helped launch the career of two other very successful Hollywood directors, Victor Fleming, who went on to direct The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind, and Marshall Neilan, who became an actor, director, writer and producer.
344	Over his long and successful career spanning over 50 years, he directed over 400 motion pictures, many of them highly acclaimed, such as the 1949 box office smash, Sands of Iwo Jima.
344	He directed his last movie in 1961.
344	He died in Los Angeles at the age of ninety-six, and is interred in the San Fernando Mission Cemetery, Mission Hills, California.
344	Allan Dwan has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6263 Hollywood Boulevard.

358	With an economy based on oil resources, manufacturing has suffered, in what is called Dutch disease.
358	Sonatrach, the national oil company, is the largest company in Africa.
358	Algeria has the second largest army with the largest defense budget in Africa.
358	Algeria had a peaceful Nuclear Program by the 1990s.
358	With a total area of , Algeria is the tenth-largest country in the world and the largest in Africa, and in the Mediterranean.
358	The country is bordered in the northeast by Tunisia, in the east by Libya, in the west by Morocco, in the southwest by Western Sahara, Mauritania, and Mali, in the southeast by Niger, and in the north by the Mediterranean Sea.
358	Algeria is a member of the African Union, the Arab League, OPEC and the United Nations, and is a founding member of the Arab Maghreb Union.
358	The territory of today's Algeria was the home of many ancient prehistoric cultures, including Aterian and Capsian cultures.
358	Its area has known many empires and dynasties, including ancient Berber Numidians, Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, Byzantines, Arab Umayyads, Berber Fatimids, Berber Almohads and later Turkish Ottomans.
358	Etymology The country's name derives from the city of Algiers.
358	The most common etymology links the city name to al-Jazā'ir (الجزائر, "The Islands"), a truncated form of the city's older name Jazā'ir Banī Mazghanna (جزائر بني مزغنة, "Islands of the Mazghanna Tribe"), employed by medieval geographers such as al-Idrisi.
358	Others  trace it to Ldzayer, the Maghrebi Arabic and Berber for "Algeria" possibly related to the Zirid Dynasty King Ziri ibn-Manad and founder of the city of Algiers.
358	History Ancient history At Ain Hanech region (Saïda Province), early remnants (200,000 BC) of hominid occupation in North Africa were found.
358	Neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the Levalloisian and Mousterian styles (43,000 BC) similar to those in the Levant.
358	Algeria was the site of the highest state of development of Middle Paleolithic Flake tool techniques.
358	Tools of this era, starting about 30,000 BC, are called Aterian (after the archeological site of Bir el Ater, south of Annaba).
358	The earliest blade industries in North Africa are called Iberomaurusian (located mainly in Oran region).
358	This industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the Maghreb b region).
358	This industry appears to have spread throughout the coastetween 15,000 and 10,000 BC.
358	Neolithic civilization (animal domestication and agriculture) developed in the Saharan and Mediterranean Maghrib between 6000 and 2000 BC.
358	This life, richly depicted in the Tassili n'Ajjer paintings, predominated in Algeria until the classical period.
358	The amalgam of peoples of North Africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that came to be called Berbers, who are the indigenous peoples of northern Africa.
358	From their principal center of power at Carthage, the Carthaginians expanded and established small settlements along the North African coast; by 600 BC, a Phoenician presence existed at Tipasa, east of Cherchell, Hippo Regius (modern Annaba) and Rusicade (modern Skikda).
358	These settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages.
358	As Carthaginian power grew, its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically.
358	Berber civilization was already at a stage in which agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and political organization supported several states.
358	Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew, but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others.
358	By the early 4th century BC, Berbers formed the single largest element of the Carthaginian army.
358	In the Revolt of the Mercenaries, Berber soldiers rebelled from 241 to 238 BC after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the First Punic War.
358	They succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthage's North African territory, and they minted coins bearing the name Libyan, used in Greek to describe natives of North Africa.
358	The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the Punic Wars.
358	In 146 BC the city of Carthage was destroyed.
358	As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew.
358	By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged.
358	Two of them were established in Numidia, behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage.
358	West of Numidia lay Mauretania, which extended across the Moulouya River in modern day Morocco to the Atlantic Ocean.
358	The high point of Berber civilization, unequaled until the coming of the Almohads and Almoravids more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of Massinissa in the 2nd century BC.
358	After Masinissa's death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times.
358	Massinissa's line survived until 24 AD, when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the Roman Empire.
358	For several centuries Algeria was ruled by the Romans, who founded many colonies in the region.
358	Like the rest of North Africa, Algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire, exporting cereals and other agricultural products.
358	The Vandals of Geiseric moved into North Africa in 429, and by 435 controlled coastal Numidia.
358	They did not make any significant settlement on the land.
358	The region was later recaptured by the Eastern Roman Empire, which ruled it until the Muslim Conquest in the 7th century.
358	Middle Ages When Muslim Arabs arrived in Algeria in the mid-7th century, a large number of locals converted to the new faith.
358	After the fall of the Umayyad Arab Dynasty in 751, numerous local Berber dynasties emerged.
358	Amongst those dynasties were the Aghlabids, Almohads, Abdalwadid, Zirids, Rustamids, Hammadids, Almoravids and the Fatimids.
358	Berber Kutama of the Petite Kabylie to its cause, the Shia Fatimids overthrew the Rustamids, and conquered Egypt, leaving Algeria and Tunisia to their Zirid vassals.
358	When the latter rebelled, the Shia Fatimids sent in the Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym Arabian tribes who unexpectedly defeated the Zirids.
358	The Berber people controlled much of the Maghreb region throughout the Middle Ages.
358	The Berbers were made up of several tribes.
358	The two main branches were the Botr and Barnès tribes, who were divided into tribes, and again into sub-tribes.
358	Each region of the Maghreb contained several tribes (for example, Sanhadja, Houaras, Zenata, Masmouda, Kutama, Awarba, and Berghwata).
358	All these tribes were independent and made territorial decisions.
358	Several Berber dynasties emerged during the Middle Ages in Maghreb, Sudan, Andalusia, Sicily, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Egypt, and other nearby lands.
358	Ibn Khaldun provides a table summarizing the Zirid, Banu Ifran, Maghrawa, Almoravid, Hammadid, Almohad, Merinid, Abdalwadid, Wattasid, Meknassa and Hafsid dynasties.
358	In the early 16th century, Spain constructed fortified outposts (presidios) on or near the Algerian coast.
358	Spain took control of Mers el Kebir in 1505; Oran in 1509; and Tlemcen, Mostaganem, and Ténès, in 1510.
358	In the same year, the merchants of Algiers ceded one of the rocky islets in their harbor to Spain, which built a fort on it.
358	The presidios in North Africa turned out to be a costly and largely ineffective military endeavor that did not guarantee access for Spain's merchant fleet.
358	Ottoman Algeria In 1516 the Muslim privateer brothers Aruj and Hayreddin Barbarossa, who operated successfully under the Hafsids, moved their base of operations to Algiers.
358	When Aruj was killed in 1518 during his invasion of Tlemcen, Hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of Algiers.
358	The Ottoman sultan gave him the title of beylerbey and a contingent of some 2,000 janissaries.
358	With the aid of this force, Hayreddin subdued the coastal region between Constantine and Oran (although the city of Oran remained in Spanish hands until 1791).
358	The next beylerbey was Hayreddin's son Hasan, who assumed the position in 1544.
358	Until 1587 the area was governed by officers who served terms with no fixed limits.
358	Subsequently, with the institution of a regular Ottoman administration, governors with the title of pasha ruled for three-year terms.
358	The pasha was assisted by janissaries, known in Algeria as the ojaq and led by an agha.
358	Discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid-1600s because they were not paid regularly, and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha.
358	As a result, the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659.
358	Plague had repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa.
358	Algiers lost from 30,000 to 50,000 inhabitants to the plague in 1620–21, and suffered high fatalities in 1654–57, 1665, 1691, and 1740–42.
358	In 1671, the taifa rebelled, killed the agha, and placed one of its own in power.
358	The new leader received the title of dey.
358	After 1689, the right to select the dey passed to the divan, a council of some sixty notables.
358	It was at first dominated by theojaq; but by the 18th century, it had become the dey's instrument.
358	In 1710, the dey persuaded the sultan to recognize him and his successors as regent, replacing the pasha in that role.
358	Although Algiers remained a part of the Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman government ceased to have effective influence there.
358	The dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat.
358	The dey was elected for a life term, but in the 159 years (1671–1830) that the system survived, fourteen of the twenty-nine deys were assassinated.
358	Despite usurpation, military coups, and occasional mob rule, the day-to-day operation of government was remarkably orderly.
358	Although the regency patronized the tribal chieftains, it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside, where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest.
358	Autonomous tribal states were tolerated, and the regency's authority was seldom applied in the Kabylie.
358	Privateers era   The Barbary pirates preyed on Christian and other non-Islamic shipping in the western Mediterranean Sea.
358	The pirates often took the passengers and crew on the ships and sold them or used them as slaves.
358	They also did a brisk business in ransoming some of the captives.
358	According to Robert Davis, from the 16th to 19th century, pirates captured 1 million to 1.25 million Europeans as slaves.
358	They often made raids, called Razzias, on European coastal towns to capture Christian slaves to sell at slave markets in North Africa and the Ottoman Empire.
358	In 1544, Hayreddin captured the island of Ischia, taking 4,000 prisoners, and enslaved some 9,000 inhabitants of Lipari, almost the entire population.
358	In 1551, Turgut Reis enslaved the entire population of the Maltese island of Gozo, between 5,000 and 6,000, sending the captives to Libya.
358	In 1554, pirates sacked Vieste in southern Italy and took an estimated 7,000 captives as slaves.
358	In 1558, Barbary corsairs captured the town of Ciutadella (Minorca), destroyed it, slaughtered the inhabitants and took 3,000 survivors as slaves to Istanbul.
358	Barbary pirates often attacked the Balearic Islands, and in response, the residents built many coastal watchtowers and fortified churchesd.
358	The threat was so severe that residents abandoned the island of Formentera.
358	Between 1609 to 1616, England lost 466 merchant ships to Barbary pirates.
358	In the 19th century, the pirates forged affiliations with Caribbean powers, paying a "license tax" in exchange for safe harbor of their vessels.
358	One American slave reported that the Algerians had enslaved 130 American seamen in the Mediterranean and Atlantic from 1785 to 1793.
358	Piracy on American vessels in the Mediterranean resulted in the United States initiating the First (1801–1805) and Second Barbary Wars (1815).
358	Following those wars, Algeria was weaker, and Europeans, with an Anglo-Dutch fleet commanded by the British Lord Exmouth, attacked Algiers.
358	After a nine-hour bombardment, they obtained a treaty from the Dey that reaffirmed the conditions imposed by Decatur (US navy) concerning the demands of tributes.
358	In addition, the Dey agreed to end the practice of enslaving Christians.
358	French Algeria On the pretext of a slight to their coot;Fan Affair" which wansul, the French invaded and captured Algiers in 1830.
358	The conquest of Algeria by the French was long and resulted in considerable bloodshed.
358	A combination of violence and disease epidemics caused the indigenous Algerian population to decline by nearly one-third from 1830 to 1872.
358	The population of Algeria, which stood at about 1.5 million in 1830, reached nearly 11 million in 1960.
358	French policy was predicated on "civilizing" the country, although its literacy rate of 50% in 1830, according to some Algerian historians, exceeded that of France.
358	Algeria's social fabric suffered during the occupation: literacy plummeted.
358	During this period, a small but influential French-speaking indigenous elite was formed, made up of Berbers mostly from Kabyles.
358	In the French policy of "divide to reign," its government favored the Kabyles.
358	About 80% of Indigenous Schools were constructed for Kabyles.
358	From 1848 until independence, France administered the whole Mediterranean region of Algeria as an integral part and département of the nation.
358	One of France's longest-held overseas territories, Algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of European immigrants, who became known as colons and later, as pieds-noirs.
358	Between 1825 and 1847, 50,000 French people emigrated to Algeria.
358	These settlers benefited from the French government's confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples, and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land.
358	Gradually, dissatisfaction among the Muslim population, which lacked political and economic status in the colonial system, gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy, and eventually independence, from France.
358	Tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954, when the first violent events of what was later called the Algerian War began.
358	Historians have estimated that between 30,000 and 150,000 Harkis and their dependents were killed by the Front de Libération Nationale (FLN) or by lynch mobs in Algeria.
358	The FLN used terrorist attacks in Algeria and France as part of its war, and the French conducted severe reprisals and repression.
358	The war concluded in 1962, when Algeria gained complete independence following the March 1962 Evian agreements and the July 1962 self-determination referendum.
358	Independence Algeria's first president was the FLN leader Ahmed Ben Bella.
358	Morocco's claim to portions of western Algeria led to the Sand War in 1963.
358	Ben Bella was overthrown in 1965 by Houari Boumédienne, his former ally and defense minister.
358	Under Ben Bella, the government had become increasingly socialist and authoritarian; Boumédienne continued this trend.
358	But, he relied much more on the army for his support, and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role.
358	He collectivised agriculture and launched a massive industrialization drive.
358	Oil extraction facilities were nationalized.
358	This was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international 1973 oil crisis.
358	In the 1960s and 1970s under President Houari Boumediene, Algeria pursued a programme of industrialisation within a state-controlled socialist economy.
358	Boumediene's successor, Chadli Bendjedid, introduced some liberal economic reforms.
358	He promoted a policy of Arabisation in Algerian society and public life.
358	Teachers of Arabic, brought in from other Muslim countries, spread radical Islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of political Islamism.
358	The Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil, leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the 1980s oil glut.
358	Economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in Algerian social unrest during the 1980s; by the end of the decade, Bendjedid introduced a multi-party system.
358	Political parties developed, such as the Front Islamique du Salut (FIS), a broad coalition of Islamist groups.
358	Civil War and aftermath In December 1991 the Front Islamique du Salut dominated the first of two rounds of legislative elections.
358	Fearing the election of an Islamist government, the authorities intervened on 11 January 1992, cancelling the elections.
358	Bendjedid resigned and a High Council of State was installed to act as Presidency.
358	It banned the FIS, triggering a civil insurgency between its armed wing, the Armed Islamic Group, and the national armed forces, in which more than 100,000 persons are thought to have died.
358	The Armed Islamic Group declared a ceasefire in October 1997.
358	Algeria held elections in 1999, which wt;faco" /> Algeria heere won by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika.
358	He worked to restore political stability to the country  and announced a 'Civil Concord' initiative, approved in a referendum, under which many political prisoners were pardoned, and several thousand members of armed groups were granted exemption from prosecution under a limited amnesty, in force until 13 January 2000.
358	The AIS disbanded and levels of insurgent violence fell rapidly.
358	The Groupe Salafiste pour la Prédication et le Combat (GSPC), a splinter group of the Group Islamic Armée, continued a terrorist campaign against the Government.
358	Bouteflika was re-elected in the April 2004 presidential election after campaigning on a programme of national reconciliation.
358	The programme comprised economic, institutional, political and social reform to modernise the country, raise living standards, and tackle the causes of alienation.
358	It also included a second amnesty initiative, the Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation, which was approved in a referendum in September 2005.
358	It offered amnesty to most guerrillas and Government security forces.
358	In November 2008, the Algerian Constitution was amended following a vote in Parliament, removing the two-term limit on Presidential incumbents.
358	This change enabled Bouteflika to stand for re-election in the 2009 presidential elections, and he was re-elected in April 2009.
358	During his election campaign and following his re-election, Bouteflika promised to extend the programme of national reconciliation and a $150-billion spending programme to create three million new jobs, the construction of one million new housing units, and to continue public sector and infrastructure modernisation programmes.
358	A continuing series of protests throughout the country started on 28 December 2010, inspired by similar protests across the Middle East and North Africa.
358	On 24 February 2011, the government lifted Algeria's 19-year-old state of emergency.
358	The government enacted legislation dealing with political parties, the electoral code, and the representation of women in elected bodies.
358	In April 2011, Bouteflika promised further constitutional and political reform.
358	Geography  Algeria is the largest country in Africa, the Arab world, and the Mediterranean Basin.
358	Its southern part includes a significant portion of the Sahara.
358	To the north, the Tell Atlas form with the Saharan Atlas, further south, two parallel sets of reliefs in approaching eastbound, and between which are inserted vast plains and highlands.
358	Both Atlas tend to merge in eastern Algeria.
358	The vast mountain ranges of Aures and Nememcha occupy the entire northeastern Algeria and are delineated by the Tunisian border.
358	The highest point is Mount Tahat ( m).
358	Algeria lies mostly between latitudes 19° and 37°N (a small area is north of 37°), and longitudes 9°W and 12°E.
358	Most of the coastal area is hilly, sometimes even mountainous, and there are a few natural harbours.
358	The area from the coast to the Tell Atlas is fertile.
358	South of the Tell Atlas is a steppe landscape ending with the Saharan Atlas; farther south, there is the Sahara desert.
358	The Ahaggar Mountains (), also known as the Hoggar, are a highland region in central Sahara, southern Algeria.
358	They are located about 1500 km south of the capital, Algiers, and just west of Tamanghasset.
358	Algiers, Oran, Constantine, Tizi Ouzou and Annaba are Algeria's main cities.
358	Climate and hydrology  In this region, midday desert temperatures can be hot year round.
358	After sunset, however, the clear, dry air permits rapid loss of heat, and the nights are cool to chilly.
358	Enormous daily ranges in temperature are recorded.
358	The highest official temperature was  at In Salah.
358	Rainfall is fairly plentiful along the coastal part of the Tell Atlas, ranging from 400 to annually, the amount of precipitation increasing from west to east.
358	Precipitation is heaviest in the northern part of eastern Algeria, where it reaches as much as 1000 mm in some years.
358	Farther inland, the rainfall is less plentiful.
358	Prevailing winds that are easterly and north-easterly in summer change to westerly and northerly in winter and carry with them a general increase in precipitation from September through December, a decrease in the late winter and spring months, and a near absence of rainfall during the summer months.
358	Algeria also has ergs, or sand dunes, between mountains.
358	Among these, in the summer time when winds are heavy and gusty, temperatures can get up to 110 °F.
358	Fauna and Flora  The varied vegetation of Algeria includes coastal, mountainous and grassy desert-like regions which all support a wide range of wildlife.
358	Many of the creatures comprising the Algerian wildlife live in close proximity to civilization.
358	The most commonly seen animals include the wild boars, jackals, and gazelles, although it is not uncommon to spot fennecs (foxes), and jerboas.
358	Algeria also has a few panther, leopard and cheetah populations, but these are seldom seen.
358	A variety of bird species makes the country an attraction for bird watchers.
358	The forests are inhabited by boars and jackals.
358	Barbary macaques are the sole native monkey.
358	Snakes, monitor lizards, and numerous other reptiles can be found living among an array of rodents throughout the semi arid regions of Algeria.
358	Many animals are now extinct, among which the Barbary lions and bears.
358	In the north, some of the native flora includes Macchia scrub, olive trees, oaks, cedars and other conifers.
358	The mountain regions contain large forests of evergreens (Aleppo pine, juniper, and evergreen oak) and some deciduous trees.
358	Fig, eucalyptus, agave, and various palm trees grow ind some deciduous trees.
358	The grape vine is indigenous to the coast.
358	In the Sahara region, some oases have palm trees.
358	Acacias with wild olives are the predominant flora in the remainder of the Sahara.
358	Camels are used extensively; the desert also abounds with poisonous and nonpoisonous snakes, scorpions, and numerous insects.
358	Politics  Algeria is an authoritarian regime, according to the Democracy Index 2010.
358	The Freedom of the Press 2009 report gives it rating "Not Free".
358	Elected politicians are considered to have relatively little sway over Algeria.
358	Instead, a group of unelected civilian and military "décideurs", known as "le pouvoir" ("the power"), actually rule the country, even deciding who should be president.
358	The most powerful man may be Mohamed Mediène, head of the military intelligence.
358	In recent years, many of these generals have died or retired.
358	After the death of General Larbi Belkheir, Bouteflika put loyalists in key posts, notably at Sonatrach, and secured constitutional amendments that make him re-electable indefinitely.
358	The head of state is the president of Algeria, who is elected for a five-year term.
358	The president was formerly limited to two five-year terms, but a constitutional amendment passed by the Parliament on 11 November 2008 removed this limitation.
358	Algeria has universal suffrage at 18 years of age.
358	The President is the head of the army, the Council of Ministers the High Security Council.
358	He appoints the Prime Minister who is also the head of government.
358	The Algerian parliament is bicameral; the lower house, the People's National Assembly, has 462 members who are directly elected for five-year terms, while the upper house, the Council of the Nation, has 144 members serving six-year terms, of which 96 members are chosen by local assemblies and 48 are appointed by the president.
358	According to the constitution, no political association may be formed if it is "based on differences in religion, language, race, gender, profession or region".
358	In addition, political campaigns must be exempt from the aforementioned subjects.
358	Parliamentary elections were last held in May 2012, and were judged to be largely free by international monitors, though local groups alleged fraud and irregularities.
358	In the elections, the FLN won 221 seats, the military-backed National Rally for Democracy won 70, and the Islamist Green Algeria Alliance won 47.
358	Foreign relations In October 2009, Algeria cancelled a weapons deal with France over the possibility of inclusion of Israeli parts in them.
358	Tensions between Algeria and Morocco in relation to the Western Sahara have been an obstacle to tightening the Arab Maghreb Union, nominally established in 1989, but which has carried little practical weight.
358	Military The military of Algeria consists of the People's National Army (ANP), the Algerian National Navy (MRA), and the Algerian Air Force (QJJ), plus the Territorial Air Defense Force.
358	It is the direct successor of the Armée de Libération Nationale (ALN), the armed wing of the nationalist National Liberation Front which fought French colonial occupation during the Algerian War of Independence (1954–62).
358	Total military personnel include 147,000 active, 150,000 reserve, and 187,000 paramilitary staff (2008 estimate).
358	Service in the military is compulsory for men aged 19–30, for a total of 18 months (six training and 12 in civil projects).
358	The total military expenditure in 2006 was estimated variously at 2.7% of GDP (3,096 million), or 3.3% of GDP.
358	In 2007, the Algerian Air Force signed a deal with Russia to purchase 49 MiG-29SMT and 6 MiG-29UBT at an estimated cost of $1.9 billion.
358	It also agreed to return old aircraft purchased from the former USSR.
358	Russia is also building two 636-type diesel submarines for Algeria.
358	Provinces and districts  Algeria is divided into 48 provinces (wilayas), 553 districts (daïras) and 1,541 municipalities (baladiyahs).
358	Each province, district, and municipality is named after its seat, which is usually the largest city.
358	The administrative divisions have changed several times since independence.
358	When introducing new provinces, the numbers of old provinces are kept, hence the non-alphabetical order.
358	With their official numbers, currently (since 1983) they are: Economy Algeria is classified as an upper middle income country by the World Bank.
358	The economy remains dominated by the state, a legacy of the country's socialist post-independence development model.
358	In recent years the Algerian Government has halted the privatization of state-owned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy.
358	Algeria has struggled to develop industries outside of hydrocarbons in part because of high costs and an inert state bureaucracy.
358	The government's efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector have done little to reduce high youth unemployment rates or to address housing shortages.
358	The country is facing a number of short-term and medium-term problems, including the need to diversify the economy, strengthen political, economic and financial reforms, improve the business climate and reduce inequalities amongst regions.
358	A wave of economic protests in February and March 2011 prompted the Algerian Government to offer more than $23 billion in public grants and retroactive salary and benefit increases.
358	Public spending has increased by 27% annually during the past five years.
358	The 2010–14 public-investment programme will cost US$ 286 billion, 40% of which  will go to human development.
358	The Algerian economy grew by 2.6% in 2011, driven by public spending, in particular in the construction and public-works sector, and by growing internal demand.
358	If hydrocarbons are excluded, growth has been estimated at 4.8%.
358	Growth of 3.1% is expected in 2012, rising to 4.2% in 2013.
358	The rate of inflation was 3.9% and the budget deficit 3% of GDP.

359	This is a list of characters in Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged.
359	Major characters The following are major characters from the novel.
359	Protagonists ays on Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged or A Dagny Taggart Dagny Taggart is the protagonist of the novel.
359	She is Vice-President in Charge of Operations for Taggart Transcontinental, under her brother, James Taggart.
359	However, due to James' incompetence, it is Dagny who is responsible for all the workings of the railroad.
359	Dagny has three romantic relationships, each with a man of ability: Francisco d'Anconia, Hank Rearden, and John Galt.
359	Galt marks the pinnacle of everything Dagny seeks in the world and is the kind of man alluded to in her youth when she imagines a man standing off in the distance, at the end of a great set of railroad tracks and all her struggles.
359	The essential drama of Dagny's character is her struggle to reconcile the life she lives and the railroad which she loves with the moral code of those who wish to destroy it.
359	She believes these destroyers simply want to heap burdens upon her for the sake of others, which she has the ability to carry.
359	Like Hank, she believes they want to live, but are too stupid and incompetent to realize how their duties and altruistic projects impede that goal.
359	It is not until she sees the man most important to her in the world - John Galt - strapped to a torture machine, about to be killed by the looters (who recognize, too, that he is the only man who can save them from economic collapse), that she realizes that the moral code of the looters is one of death: they recognize what is good and necessary for life, but wish to destroy it anyway.
359	She is a typical Randian heroine, similar to Dominique Francon (The Fountainhead) or Kira Argounova (We the Living).
359	Francisco d'Anconia Francisco d'Anconia is one of the central characters in Atlas Shrugged, and owner by inheritance of the world's largest copper mining empire.
359	He is a childhood friend, and the first love of Dagny Taggart.
359	A child prodigy of exceptional talents, Francisco was dubbed the "climax" of the d'Anconia line, an already prestigious family of skilled industrialists.
359	He attended Patrick Henry University and was a classmate of John Galt and Ragnar Danneskjöld and student of both Hugh Akston and Robert Stadler.
359	He began working at a young age, while still in school, proving that he could have made a successful career on his own merits without the aid of his family's wealth and power.
359	Francisco is one of the strikers and is slowly destroying the d'Anconia empire to put it out of the raiders' reach.
359	His actions were designed both to "trap" looters into relying upon his worthless ventures in order to disrupt their schemes and to try to show the inevitable consequences of looting.
359	He adopted the persona of a worthless playboy, by which he is known to the world, as an effective cover.
359	However, he is forced to give up Dagny, knowing that she would not be ready to join the strikers.
359	He remains deeply in love with her throughout the book, while also being a good and loyal friend of her other two lovers, Hank Rearden and John Galt.
359	His full name is given as Francisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebastián d'Anconia.
359	John Galt The enigmatic John Galt is the primary male hero of Atlas Shrugged.
359	He initially appears as an unnamed menial worker for Taggart Transcontinental, who often dines with Eddie Willers in the employee's cafeteria, and leads Eddie to reveal important information about Dagny Taggart and Taggart Transcontinental.
359	Only Eddie's side of their conversations is given in the novel.
359	Eddie tells him which suppliers and contractors Dagny is most dependent on; these men are consistently the next to disappear.
359	Later in the novel, the reader discovers this worker's true identity.
359	Before working for Taggart Transcontinental, Galt worked as an engineer for the Twentieth Century Motor Company.
359	While there, he invented his generator that produces electricity from static electricity in the environment.
359	His Prototype may or may not have been completed when he left due to the management deciding on a communistic pay system.
359	This Prototype was found by Dagny when she and Hank Rearden made a trip to the long-closed Twentieth Century Motor factory.
359	Dagny would hire Quenten Daniels to try to figure out how the machine worked.
359	Galt would take over the radio airwaves during Mr.
359	Thompson's much heralded speech at the end of the book and give his long soliloquy.
359	Henry "Hank" Rearden Henry (also known as "Hank") is one of the central characters in Atlas Shrugged.
359	Like many of Rand's capitalist characters, he is a self-made man.
359	He owns the most important steel company in the United States.
359	He invents Rearden Metal, an alloy stronger than steel (with similar properties to stainless steel).
359	He lives in Philadelphia with his wife Lillian, his brother Philip, and his elderly mother, all of whom he supports.
359	Hank Rearden knows something is wrong with the world but he is unable to define the problem.
359	His friend, Francisco d'Anconia, helps him understand and by this mechanism the reader is also prepared to understand the secret when it is revealed explicitly in Galt's Speech.
359	Rearden also serves to illustrate Rand's theory of sex.
359	Lillian Rearden cannot appreciate Hank Rearden's virtues, and she is portrayed as being disgusted by sex.
359	Dagny Taggart clearly does appreciate Rearden's virtues, and this appreciation evolves into sexual desire.
359	Rearden is torn because he accepts the premises of the traditional view of sex as a lower instinct, but he responds sexually to Dagny, who represents his highest values.
359	Rearden struggles to resolve this internal conflict, and in doing so, illustrates Rand's sexual theory.
359	Eddie Willers Edwin "Eddie" Willers is the Special Assistant to the Vice-President in Charge of Operations at Taggart Transcontinental.
359	He grew up with Dagny Taggart.
359	His father and grandfather worked for the Taggarts, and he followed in their footsteps.
359	He is completely loyal to Dagny and to Taggart Transcontinental.
359	He is also secretly in love with Dagny.
359	Willers is generally assumed to represent the common man: someone who does not possess the Promethean creative ability of The Strikers, but matches them in moral courage and is capable of appreciating and making use of their creations.
359	After Dagny shifts her attention and loyalty to saving the captive Galt, he does everything he can to keep the railroad running as the country falls apart.
359	When the train he is riding on breaks down, he tries in vain to repair it as the passengers and crew abandon him, then collapses sobbing on the tracks.
359	Ragnar Danneskjöld One of the original strikers, he is now world famous as a pirate.
359	Ragnar attended Patrick Henry University and became friends with John Galt and Francisco d'Anconia while studying under Hugh Akston and Robert Stadler.
359	Danneskjöld seizes relief ships that are being sent from the United States to The People's States of Europe.
359	As the novel progresses, Danneskjöld begins to become active in American waters.
359	Danneskjöld's action is to restore to other creative people the money, in gold, which was unjustly taken away from them—specifically, their income tax payments.
359	He explains this is not altruism; his motivation is to ensure that once those espousing Galt's philosophy are restored to their rightful place in society, they will have enough capital to rebuild the world.
359	Kept in the background for much of the book, Danneskjöld makes a personal appearance when he risks his life to meet Hank Rearden in the night and hand him a bar of gold as an "advance payment" to encourage Rearden to persevere in his increasingly difficult situation.
359	Danneskjöld is married to the actress Kay Ludlow; their re in his increasingrelationship is kept hidden from the outside world, which only knows of Ludlow as a film star who retired and dropped out of sight.
359	It is mentioned that some of the strikers have strong reservations about his way of "conducting the common struggle."
359	According to Barbara Branden, who was closely associated with Rand at the time the book was written, there were sections written describing Danneskjöld's adventures at sea, which were cut from the final published text.
359	In a 1974 comment at a lecture, Ayn Rand admitted that Danneskjöld's name was a tribute to Victor Hugo.
359	The hero of Hugo's novel, Hans of Iceland, becomes the first of the Counts of Danneskjöld.
359	In the published book, Danneskjöld is always seen through the eyes of others (Dagny Taggart or Hank Rearden), except for a brief paragraph in the very last chapter.
359	Antagonists James Taggart The President of Taggart Transcontinental and the book's most important antagonist.
359	Taggart is an expert influence peddler who is, however, incapable of making operational decisions on his own.
359	He relies on his sister, Dagny Taggart, to actually run the railroad, but nonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor.
359	In a sense, he is the antithesis of Dagny.
359	As the novel progresses, the moral philosophy of the looters is revealed: it is a code of stagnation.
359	The goal of this code is to not exist, to not move forward, to become a zero.
359	Taggart struggles to remain unaware that this is his goal.
359	He maintains his pretense that he wants to live, and becomes horrified whenever his mind starts to grasp the truth about himself.
359	This contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life: the desire to destroy those on whom his life depends, and the horror that he will succeed at this.
359	In the final chapters of the novel, he suffers a complete mental breakdown upon realizing that he can no longer deceive himself in this respect.
359	Lillian Rearden The unsupportive wife of Hank Rearden.
359	They have been married eight years as the novel begins.
359	Lillian is a frigid moocher who seeks to destroy her husband.
359	She compares being Rearden's wife with owning the world's most powerful horse.
359	Since she cannot comfortably ride a horse that goes too fast, she must bridle it down to her level, even if that means it will never reach its full potential and its power will be grievously wasted.
359	Lillian tolerates sex with her husband only because she is "realistic" enough to know he is just a brute who requires satisfaction of his brute instincts.
359	She indicates that she abhors Francisco d'Anconia, because she believes he is a sexual adventurer.
359	As her motives become more clear, Lillian is found to share the sentiments of many other moochers and their worship of destruction.
359	Her actions are explained as the desire to destroy achievement in the false belief that such an act bestows a greatness to the destroyer equal to the accomplishment destroyed.
359	She seeks, then, to ruin Rearden in an effort to prove her own value.
359	Lillian achieves her goal to destroy Rearden's business, when she passes on information to James Taggart about her husband's affair.
359	This information is used to persuade Rearden to sign the Gift Certificate (which delivers all the property rights of Rearden Metal to the looters) and thereby destroys his business.
359	Lillian discovers that she can accomplish her goal to destroy the business but she can neither achieve the greatness she desires nor her goal to destroy Hank's character.
359	She uses James Taggart for sex as victory and revenge against Hank and Dagny.
359	This does give her the satisfaction she desires and she continues to manipulate Hank until he finally leaves her and joins Galt's strikers.
359	Dr.
359	Floyd Ferris Ferris is a biologist who works as "co-ordinator" at the State Science Institute.
359	He uses his position there to deride reason and productive achievement, and publishes a book entitled Why Do You Think You Think?
359	He clashes on several occasions with Hank Rearden, and twice attempts to blackmail Rearden into giving up Rearden Metal.
359	He is also one of the group of looters who tries to get Rearden to agree to the Steel Unification Plan.
359	Ferris hosts the demonstration of the Project X weapon, and is the creator of the Ferris Persuader, a torture machine.
359	When John Galt is captured by the looters, Ferris uses the device on Galt, but it breaks down before extracting the information Ferris wants from Galt.
359	Ferris represents the group which uses brute force on the heroes to achieve the ends of the looters.
359	Dr.
359	Robert Stadler A former professor at Patrick Henry University, mentor to Francisco d'Anconia, John Galt and Ragnar Danneskjöld.
359	He has since become a sell-out, one who had great promise but squandered it for social approval, to the detriment of the free.
359	He works at the State Science Institute where all his inventions are perverted for use by the military, including the instrument of his demise: Project X (Xylophone).
359	The character was, in part, modeled on J.
359	Robert Oppenheimer, whom Rand had interviewed for an earlier project, and his part in the creation of nuclear weapons.
359	To his former student Galt, Stadler represents the epitome of human evil, as the "man who knew better" but chose not to act for the good.
359	He is based on Plato.
359	Wesley Mouch The incompetent and treacherous lobbyist whom Hank Rearden reluctantly employs in Washington, who rises to prominence and authority throughout the novel through trading favours and disloyalty.
359	In return for betraying Hank by helping broker the Equalization of Opportunity Bill (which, by restricting the number of businesses each person may own to one, forces Hank to divest most of his companies), he is given a senior position at the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources.
359	Later in the novel he becomes its Top Co-ordinator, a position that eventually becomes Economic Dictator of the country.

359	Notes
569	Anthropology is the "science of humanity."
569	It has origins in the humanities, the natural sciences, and the social sciences.
569	The term "anthropology" is from the Greek anthrōpos (), "man", understood to mean humankind or humanity, and -logia (-λογία), "discourse" or "study."
569	Since the work of Franz Boas and Bronisław Malinowski in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, anthropology has been distinguished from other social sciences by its emphasis on in-depth examination of context, cross-cultural comparisons, and the importance it places on participant-observation, or long-term, experiential immersion in the area of research.
569	Cultural anthropology in particular has emphasized cultural relativity,  holism and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques.
569	This has been particularly prominent in the United States, from Boas's arguments against 19th-century racial ideology, through Margaret Mead's advocacy for gender equality and sexual liberation, to current criticisms of post-colonial oppression and promotion of multiculturalism.
569	Ethnography is one of its primary methods as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork.
569	In the United States, the discipline is traditionally divided into four sub-fields: cultural anthropology, archaeology, linguistic anthropology, and biological anthropology.
569	In Europe, the discipline originated as ethnology and was originally defined as the study of social organization in non-state societies.
569	It was later renamed social anthropology.
569	It is now generally referred to as socio-cultural anthropology in most of Europe, the commonwealth, and in the parts of the world that were influenced by the European tradition.
569	Disciplines In the United States, anthropology is traditionally divided into four fields: biological or physical anthropology, social anthropology or cultural anthropology, archaeology and anthropological linguistics.
569	These fields frequently overlap, but tend to use different methodologies and techniques.
569	In Great Britain and the Commonwealth countries, the British tradition of Social Anthropology tends to dominate.
569	In some European countries, all cultural anthropology is known as ethnology (a term coined and defined by Adam F.
569	Kollár in 1783).
569	Anthropologists study topics including the origin and evolution of Homo sapiens, the organization of human social and cultural relations, human physical traits, human behavior, the variations among different groups of humans, how the evolutionary past of Homo sapiens has influenced its social organization and culture, and so forth.
569	Anthropology originated in the colonial encounter between Western people and colonized non-Western people, as Europeans tried to understand the origins of observable cultural diversity.
569	Today anthropology is a global discipline, and anthropologists study all types of societies.
569	Anthropology is one of the few places where humanities, social, and natural sciences are forced to confront one another.
569	As such, anthropology has been central in the development of several new (late 20th century) interdisciplinary fields such as cognitive science, global studies, and various ethnic studies.
569	According to Clifford Geertz, "anthropology is perhaps the last of the great nineteenth-century conglomerate disciplines still for the most part organizationally intact.
569	Long after natural history, moral philosophy, philology, and political economy have dissolved into their specialized successors, it has remained a diffuse assemblage of ethnology, human biology, comparative linguistics, and prehistory, held together mainly by the vested interests, sunk costs, and administrative habits of academia, and by a romantic image of comprehensive scholarship."
569	Sociocultural anthropology has been heavily influenced by structuralist and postmodern theories, as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies.
569	During the 1970s and 1990s, there was an epistemological shift away from the positivist traditions that had largely informed the discipline.
569	During this shift, enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology.
569	In contrast, archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist.
569	Due to this difference in epistemology, the four sub-fields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades.
569	Sociocultural anthropology Cultural anthropology is also called socio-cultural anthropology or social anthropology (especially in the United Kingdom).
569	Cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people make sense of the world around them, while social anthropology is the study of the relationships among persons and groups.
569	Cultural anthropology is more akin to philosophy, literature and the arts, while social anthropology to sociology and history.
569	Anthropological inquiry is guided by cultural relativism, the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values.
569	Accepting other cultures in their own terms prevents reductionism in cross-cultural comparison.
569	This project has become the field of ethnography.
569	Ethnography can refer to both a methodology and a product of research, namely a monograph or book.
569	As methodology, ethnography is based upon long-term fieldwork within a community or other research site.
569	Participant observation is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology.
569	Ethnology involves the systematic comparison of different cultures.
569	The process of participant-observation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an emic (or insiders) point of view.
569	The study of kinship and social organization is a central focus of cultural anthropology, as kinship is a human universal.
569	Cultural anthropology also covers economic and political organization, law and conflict resolution, patterns of consumption and exchange, material culture, technology, infrastructure, gender relations, ethnicity, childrearing and socialization, religion, myth, symbols, values, etiquette, worldview, sports, music, nutrition, recreation, games, food, festivals, and language (which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology).
569	Comparison across cultures is a key element of sociocultural anthropology's method, including the industrialized (or de-industrialized) West.
569	Cultures in the more traditional standard cross-cultural sample of small scale societies are: See also the List of indigenous peoples.
569	Biological anthropology Biological Anthropology and Physical Anthropology are synonymous terms to describe anthropological research focused on the study of humans and non-human primates in their biological, evolutionary, and demographic dimensions.
569	It examines the biological and social factors that have affected the evolution of humans and other primates, and that generate, maintain or change contemporary genetic and physiological variation.
569	Archaeological anthropology Archaeology is the study of the human past through its material remains.
569	Artifacts, faunal remains, and human altered landscapes are evidence of the cultural and material lives of past societies.
569	Archaeologists examine these material remains in order to deduce patterns of past human behavior and cultural practices.
569	Ethnoarchaeology is a type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remains of living human groups in order to gain a better understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups, who are presumed to have lived in similar ways.
569	Linguistic anthropology Linguistic anthropology (also called anthropological linguistics) seeks to understand the processes of human communications, verbal and non-verbal, variation in language across time and space, the social uses of language, and the relationship between language and culture.
569	It is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems, linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes.
569	Linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including sociolinguistics, pragmatics, cognitive linguistics, semiotics, discourse analysis, and narrative analysis.
569	Key topics by field: Socio-cultural anthropology Anthropology of art, media, music, dance & film Anthropology of art  One of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of 'art' as a cultural phenomenon.
569	Several anthropologists have noted that the Western categories of 'painting', 'sculpture', or 'literature', conceived as independent artistic activities, do not exist, or exist in a significantly different form, in most non-Western contexts.
569	To surmount this difficulty, anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which, without exclusively being 'artistic', have certain evident 'aesthetic' qualities.
569	Boas' Primitive Art, Claude Lévi-Strauss' The Way of the Masks (1982) or Geertz's 'Art as Cultural System' (1983) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of 'art' into an anthropology of culturally-specific 'aesthetics'.
569	Media anthropology  Anthropology of media (also anthropology of mass media, media anthropology) emphasizes ethnographic studies as a means of understanding producers, audiences, and other cultural and social aspects of mass media.
569	The types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production (e.g., ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers, journalists in the field, film production) to contexts of media reception, following audiences in their everyday responses to media.
569	Other types include cyber anthropology, a relatively new area of internet research, as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media, such as development work, social movements, or health education.
569	This is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts, where media such as radio, the press, new media and television have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s.
569	Musical anthropology  Ethnomusicology is an academic field encompassing various approaches to the study of music (broadly defined) that emphasize its cultural, social, material, cognitive, biological, and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire.
569	Visual anthropology  Visual anthropology  is concerned, in part, with the study and production of ethnographic photography, film and, since the mid-1990s, new media.
569	While the term is sometimes used interchangeably with ethnographic film, visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation, including areas such as performance, museums, art, and the production and reception of mass media.
569	Visual representations from all cultures, such as sandpaintings, tattoos, sculptures and reliefs, cave paintings, scrimshaw, jewelry, hieroglyphics, paintings and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology.
569	Economic, Political Economic, Applied & Development anthropology  Economic anthropology  Economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic, geographic and cultural scope.
569	It has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics, of which it is highly critical.
569	Its origins as a sub-field of anthropology begin with the British founder of Anthropology, Bronislaw Malinowski, and his French compatriot, Marcel Mauss, on the nature of gift-giving exchange (or reciprocity) as an alternative to market exchange.
569	Economic Anthropology remains, for the most part, focused upon exchange.
569	The school of thought derived from Marx and known as Political Economy focuses on production, in contrast.
569	Economic Anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists, and have now turned to examine corporations, banks, and the global financial system from an anthropological perspective.
569	Political economy Political Economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of Historical Materialism to the traditional concerns of anthropology, including, but not limited to, non-capitalist societies.
569	Political Economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture.
569	Three main areas of interest rapidly developed.
569	The first of these areas was concerned with the "pre-capitalist" societies that were subject to evolutionary "tribal" stereotypes.
569	Sahlins work on Hunter-gatherers as the 'original affluent society' did much to disapate that image.
569	The second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world's population at the time, the peasantry, many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam.
569	The third area was on colonialism, imperialism, and the creation of the capitalist world-system.
569	More recently, these Political Economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial (and post-industrial) capitalism around the world.
569	Applied anthropology  Applied Anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems.
569	It is a, “complex of related, research-based, instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data, initiation of direct action, and/or the formulation of policy”.
569	More simply, applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research; it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community.
569	It is closely related to Development anthropology (distinct from the more critical Anthropology of development).
569	Anthropology of development The anthropology of development  tends to view development from a critical perspective.
569	The kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach  involve asking why, if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty, is poverty increasing?
569	Why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes?
569	Why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer?
569	Why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis?
569	In short why does so much planned development fail?
569	Anthropology of Kinship, Feminism, Gender & Sexuality Kinship & family  Kinship can refer both to the study of the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures, or it can refer to the patterns of social relationships themselves.
569	Over its history, anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms, such as descent, descent groups, lineages, affines, cognates and even fictive kinship.
569	Broadly, kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent (one's social relations during development), and also relatives by marriage.
569	Feminist anthropology  Feminist Anthrovelopment), and alspology is a four field approach to anthropology (archeological, biological, cultural, linguistic) that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings, anthropological hiring practices, and the scholarly production of knowledge.
569	Anthropology engages often with feminists from non-Western traditions, whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white European and American feminists.
569	Historically, such 'peripheral' perspectives have sometimes been marginalized and regarded as less valid or important than knowledge from the western world.
569	Feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps to correct this systematic bias in mainstream feminist theory.
569	Anthropology of gender & sexuality Medical, Psychological, Cognitive & Transpersonal Anthropology Medical anthropology  Medical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies "human health and disease, health care systems, and biocultural adaptation".
569	Currently, research in medical anthropology is one of the main growth areas in the field of anthropology as a whole.
569	It focuses on  the following six basic fields: * the development of systems of medical knowledge and medical care * the patient-physician relationship * the integration of alternative medical systems in culturally diverse environments * the interaction of social, environmental and biological factors which influence health and illness both in the individual and the community as a whole *the critical analysis of interaction between psychiatric services and migrant populations ("critical ethnopsychiatry": Beneduce 2004, 2007) * the impact of biomedicine and biomedical technologies in non-Western settings Other subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering (Farmer, 1999, 2003; Beneduce, 2010) as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness.
569	On the other hand, there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production, such as cultural psychiatry and transcultural psychiatry or ethnopsychiatry.
569	Psychological anthropology  Psychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of cultural and mental processes.
569	This subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans' development and enculturation within a particular cultural group—with its own history, language, practices, and conceptual categories—shape processes of human cognition, emotion, perception, motivation, and mental health.
569	It also examines how the understanding of cognition, emotion, motivation, and similar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes.
569	Cognitive anthropology  Cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge, cultural innovation, and transmission over time and space using the methods and theories of the cognitive sciences (especially experimental psychology and evolutionary biology) often through close collaboration with historians, ethnographers, archaeologists, linguists, musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and interpretation of cultural forms.
569	Cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them.
569	Transpersonal anthropology  Transpersonal anthropology studies the relationship between altered states of consciousness and culture.
569	As with transpersonal psychology, the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness (ASC) and transpersonal experience.
569	However, the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross-cultural issues—for instance, the roles of myth, ritual, diet, and texts in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences (Young and Goulet 1994).
569	Political & Legal anthropology Political anthropology  Political anthropology concerns the structure of political systems, looked at from the basis of the structure of societies.
569	Political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies, a new development started from the 1960s, and is still unfolding: anthropologists started increasingly to study more “complex” social settings in which the presence of states, bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena.
569	The turn towards complex societies meant that political themes  were taken up at two main levels.
569	First of all, anthropologists continued to study political organization and political phenomena that lay outside the state-regulated sphere (as in patron-client relations or tribal political organization).
569	Second of all, anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions (and of course on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions).
569	An anthropology of the state developed, and it is a most thriving field today.
569	Geertz’ comparative work on "Negara", the Balinese state is an early, famous example.
569	Legal anthropology Legal anthropology, also known as Anthropology of Law specializes in "the cross-cultural study of social ordering".
569	Earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict management, crime, sanctions, or formal regulation.
569	More  recent applications include issues such as Human Rights, Legal pluralism, Islamaphobia and Political Uprisings.
569	Public anthropology  Public Anthropology was created by Robert Borofsky, a professor at Hawaii Pacific University, to "demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline - illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad, public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change" ([http://www.publicanthropology.org/Defining/definingpa.htm Borofsky 2004]).
569	Anthropology of Science & technology Cyborg anthropology Cyborg anthropology originated as a sub-focus group within the American Anthropological Association's annual meeting in 1993.
569	The sub-group was very closely related to STS and the Society for the Social Studies of Science.
569	Donna Haraway’s 1985 Cyborg Manifesto could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term.
569	Cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built, specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings.
569	Digital anthropology  Digital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digital-era technology, and extends to various areas where anthropology and technology intersect.
569	It is sometimes grouped with sociocultural anthropology, and sometimes considered part of material culture.
569	The field is new, and thus has a variety of names with a variety of emphases.
569	These include techno-anthropology, digital ethnography, cyberanthropology, and virtual anthropology.
569	Ecological anthropology  Ecological anthropology is defined as the “study of cultural adaptations to environments”.
569	The sub-field is also defined as, "the study of relationships between a population of humans and their biophysical environment".
569	The focus of its research concerns “how cultural beliefs and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments, and how people used elements of their culture to maintain their ecosystems.” Environmental anthropology Anthropology of food, nutrition, and agriculture  Historical anthropology Anthropology of religion  The anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions, and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures.
569	Modern anthropology assumes that there is complete continuity between magical thinking and religion, and that every religion is a cultural product, created by the human community that worships it.
569	Urban anthropology  Urban anthropology is concerned with issues of urbanization, poverty, and neoliberalism.
569	Ulf Hannerz quotes a 1960s remark that traditional anthropologists were "a notoriously agoraphobic lot, anti-urban by definition".
569	Various social processes in the Western World as well as in the "Third World" (the latter being the habitual focus of attention of anthropologists) brought the attention of "specialists in 'other cultures'" closer to their homes.
569	There are two principle approaches in urban anthropology: by examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities.
569	These two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other.
569	By defining different types of cities, one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities.
569	By directly looking at the different social issues, one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city.
569	Key topics by field: Archaeological & biological anthropology  Anthrozoology  Anthrozoology (also called human–animal studies or HAS) is the study of interaction between living things.
569	It is a modern interdisciplinary and burgeoning field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines, including  anthropology, ethology, medicine, psychology, veterinary medicine and zoology.
569	A major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human-animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions.
569	It includes scholars from a diverse range of fields, including anthropology, sociology, biology, and philosophy.
569	Biocultural anthropology  Biocultural anthropology is the scientific exploration of the relationships between human biology and culture.
569	Physical anthropologists throughout the first half of the 20th century viewed this relationship from a racial perspective; that is, from the assumption that typological human biological differences lead to cultural differences.
569	After World War II the emphasis began to shift toward an effort to explore the role culture plays in shaping human biology.
569	Evolutionary anthropology  Evolutionary anthropology is the interdisciplinary study of the evolution of human physiology and human behaviour and the relation between hominids and non-hominid primates.
569	Evolutionary anthropology is based in natural science and social science.
569	Evolutionartes.
569	Evolutionary anthropoy anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans, past and present.
569	It is based on a scientific approach, and brings together fields such as archaeology, behavioral ecology, psychology, primatology, and genetics.
569	It is a dynamic and interdisciplinary field, drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience, past and present.
569	Forensic anthropology  Forensic anthropology  is the application of the science of physical anthropology and human osteology in a legal setting, most often in criminal cases where the victim's remains are in the advanced stages of decomposition.
569	A forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed, burned, mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable.
569	The adjective "forensic" refers to the application of this subfield of science to a court of law.
569	Palaeoanthropology  Paleoanthropology combines the disciplines of paleontology and physical anthropology, is the study of ancient humans as found in fossil hominid evidence such as petrifacted bones and footprints.
569	Anthropological Organizations  Contemporary anthropology is an established science with academic departments at most universities and colleges.
569	The single largest organization of Anthropologists is the American Anthropological Association (AAA), which was founded in 1903.
569	Membership is made up of anthropologists from around the globe.
569	In 1989, a group of European and American scholars in the field of anthropology established the European Association of Social Anthropologists (EASA) which serves as a major professional organization for anthropologists working in Europe.
569	The EASA seeks to advance the status of anthropology in Europe and to increase visibility of marginalized anthropological traditions and thereby contribute to the project of a global anthropology or world anthropology.
569	Hundreds of other organizations exist in the various sub-fields of anthropology, sometimes divided up by nation or region, and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines, such as geology, physics, zoology, paleontology, anatomy, music theory, art history, sociology and so on, belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well.
569	List of major organizations * American Anthropological Association * American Ethnological Society * Asociación de Antropólogos Iberoamericanos en Red, AIBR * Moving Anthropology Student Network * Anthropological Society of London * Center for World Indigenous Studies * Ethnological Society of London * Institute of Anthropology and Ethnography * Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology * Network of Concerned Anthropologists * N.
569	N.
569	Miklukho-Maklai Institute of Ethnology and Anthropology * [http://www.radicalanthropologygroup.org/ Radical Anthropology Group] * Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland * Society for anthropological sciences * Society for Applied Anthropology * USC Center for Visual Anthropology Controversial ethical stances Anthropologists, like other researchers (especially historians and scientists engaged in field research), have over time assisted state policies and projects, especially colonialism.
569	Some commentators have contended: *That the discipline grew out of colonialism, perhaps was in league with it, and derived some of its key notions from it, consciously or not.
569	See, for example, Gough, Pels and Salemink, but cf.
569	Lewis 2004).
569	That ethnographic work was often ahistorical, writing about people as if they were "out of time" in an "ethnographic present" (Johannes Fabian, Time and Its Other).
569	The ethics of cultural relativism  At the same time, anthropologists urge, as part of their quest for scientific objectivity, cultural relativism, which has an influence on all the sub-fields of anthropology.
569	This is the notion that particular cultures should not be judged by one culture's values or viewpoints, but that all cultures should be viewed as relative to each other.
569	There should be no notions, in good anthropology, of one culture being better or worse than another culture.
569	Ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting genocide, infanticide, racism, mutilation including circumcision and subincision, and torture.
569	Topics like racism, slavery or human sacrifice, therefore, attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies  to genes to acculturation have been proposed, not to mention theories of colonialism and many others as root causes of Man's inhumanity to man.
569	To illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach, one can take just one of these topics, such as "racism" and find thousands of anthropological references, stretching across all the major and minor sub-fields.
569	Ethical stance to military involvement Anthropologists' involvement with the U.S.
569	Franz Boas publicly objected to US participation in World War I, and after the war he published a brief expose and condemnation of the participation of several American archaeologists in espionage in Mexico under their cover as scientists.
569	But by the 1940s, many of Boas' anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the "Axis" (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan).
569	Many served in the armed forces, while others worked in intelligence (for example, Office of Strategic Services and the Office of War Infor worked in imation).
569	At the same time, David H.
569	Price's work on American anthropology during the Cold War provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies.
569	Attempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the CIA and government intelligence activities during the Vietnam War years have turned up surprisingly little (although anthropologist Hugo Nutini was active in the stillborn Project Camelot).
569	Many anthropologists (students and teachers) were active in the antiwar movement.
569	Numerous resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the American Anthropological Association (AAA).
569	Professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the state.
569	Their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings.
569	The Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth (ASA) has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous.
569	The AAA's current 'Statement of Professional Responsibility' clearly states that "in relation with their own government and with host governments ...
569	" Anthropologists, along with other social scientists, are working with the US military as part of the US Army's strategy in Afghanistan.
569	The Christian Science Monitor reports that "Counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs" in Afghanistan, under the Human Terrain System (HTS) program; in addition, HTS teams are working with the US military in Iraq.
569	In 2009, the American Anthropological Association's Commission on the Engagement of Anthropology with the US Security and Intelligence Communities released its final report concluding, in part, that, "When ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions, not subject to external review, where data collection occurs in the context of war, integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency, and in a potentially coercive environment – all characteristic factors of the HTS concept and its application – it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology.
569	In summary, while we stress that constructive engagement between anthropology and the military is possible, CEAUSSIC suggests that the AAA emphasize the incompatibility of HTS with disciplinary ethics and practice for job seekers and that it further recognize the problem of allowing HTS to define the meaning of “anthropology” within DoD."
569	Post–World War II developments Before WWII British 'social anthropology' and American 'cultural anthropology' were still distinct traditions.
569	After the war, enough British and American anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as 'sociocultural' anthropology.
569	Basic trends There are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work.
569	One of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more holistic account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical.
569	The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place, problem or phenomenon in detail, using a variety of methods, over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia.
569	In the 1990s and 2000s (decade), calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard.
569	It is possible to view all human cultures as part of one large, ever-changing global culture.
569	These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.
569	Biological anthropologists are interested in both human variation and in the possibility of human universals (behaviors, ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures)  They use many different methods of study, but modern population genetics, participant observation and other techniques often take anthropologists "into the field," which means traveling to a community in its own setting, to do something called "fieldwork."
569	On the biological or physical side, human measurements, genetic samples, nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs.
569	Along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis, anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions.
569	Human time on Earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material, such as the Paleolithic and the Neolithic, of particular use in archaeology.
569	Further cultural subdivisions according to tool types, such as Olduwan or Mousterian or Levalloisian help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past.
569	Anthropologists and geographers share approaches to Culture regions as well, since mapping cultures is central to both sciences.
569	By making comparisons across cultural traditions (time-based) and cultural regions (space-based), anthropologists have developed various kinds of comparative method, a central part of their science.
569	Commonalities between fields Because anthropology developed from so many different enterprises (see History of Anthropology), including but not limited to fossil-hunting, exploring, documentary film-making, paleontology, primatology, antiquity dealings and curatorship, philology, etymology, genetics, regional analysis, ethnology, history, philosophy, and religious studies, it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article, although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made.
569	For example, the classic of urban anthropology, Ulf Hannerz in the introduction to his seminal Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology mentions that the "Third World" had habitually received most of attention; anthropologists who traditionally specialized in "other cultures" looked for them far away and started to look "across the tracks" only in late 1960s.
569	Now there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the author's "home".
569	It is also argued that other fields of study, like History and Sociology, on the contrary focus disproportionately on the West.
569	In France, the study of Western societies has been traditionally left to sociologists, but this is increasingly changing, starting in the 1970s from scholars like Isac Chiva and journals like Terrain ("fieldwork"), and developing with the center founded by Marc Augé (Le Centre d'anthropologie des mondes contemporains, the Anthropological Research Center of Contemporary Societies).
569	The same approach of focusing on "modern world" topics by Terrain, was also present in the British Manchester School of the 1950s.
569	Since the 1980s it has become common for social and cultural anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the North Atlantic region, frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to a single locale.
569	There has also been a related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life of ordinary people; increasingly, research is set in settings such as scientific laboratories, social movements, governmental and nongovernmental organizations and businesses.
572	Agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and social sciences that are used in the practice and understanding of agriculture.
572	Veterinary science, but not animal science, is often excluded from the definition.) Agriculture and agricultural science The two terms are often confused.
572	However, they cover different concepts: Muhammad Awais Arain and Ammy Butt is the famous agriculture sceintist of the world *Agronomy is research and development related to studying and improving plant-based agriculture.
572	Agricultural sciences include research and development on: * Production techniques (e.g., irrigation management, recommended nitrogen inputs) * Improving agricultural productivity in terms of quantity and quality (e.g., selection of drought-resistant crops and animals, development of new pesticides, yield-sensing technologies, simulation models of crop growth, in-vitro cell culture techniques) * Transformation of primary products into end-consumer products (e.g., production, preservation, and packaging of dairy products) * Prevention and correction of adverse environmental effects (e.g., soil degradation, waste management, bioremediation) * Theoretical production ecology, relating to crop production modeling * Traditional agricultural systems, sometimes termed subsistence agriculture, which feed most of the poorest people in the world.
572	These systems are of interest as they sometimes retain a level of integration with natural ecological systems greater than that of industrial agriculture, which may be more sustainable than some modern agricultural systems.
572	Food production and demand on a global basis, with special attention paid to the major producers, such as China, India, Brazil the USA and the EU.
572	Fertilizer  One of the most common yield reducers is because of fertilizer not being applied in slightly higher quantities during transition period, the time it takes the soil to rebuild its aggregates and organic matter.
572	Yields will decrease temporarily because of nitrogen being immobilized in the crop residue, which can take a few months to several years to decompose, depending on the crop's C to N ratio and the local environment Agricultural science: a local science With the exception of theoretical agronomy, research in agronomy, more than in any other field, is strongly related to local areas.
572	It can be considered a science of ecoregions, because it is closely linked to soil properties and climate, which are never exactly the same from one place to another.
572	Many people think an agricultural production system relying on local weather, soil characteristics, and specific crops has to be studied locally.
572	Others feel a need to know and understand production systems in as many areas as possible, and the human dimension of interaction with nature.
572	History of agricultural science Agricultural science began with Tara's genetic work, but in modern terms might be better dated from the chemical fertilizer outputs of plant physiological understanding in eighteenth century Germany.
572	In the United States, a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the Hatch Act of 1887, which used the term "agricultural science".
572	The Hatch Act was driven by farmers' interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer.
572	The Ammy of 1917 shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots, but the scientific foundation had been built.
572	After 1906, public expenditures on agricultural research in the US exceeded private expenditures for the next 44 years.
572	Intensification of agriculture since the 1960s in developed and developing countries, often referred to as the Green Revolution, was closely tied to progress made in  selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity, as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial fertilizers and phytosanitary products.
572	As the oldest and largest human intervention in nature, thnd pestie environmental impact  of agriculture in general and more recently intensive agriculture, industrial development, and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields.
572	These include technological fields  that assume the solution to technological problems lies in better technology, such as integrated pest management, waste treatment technologies, landscape architecture, genomics, and agricultural philosophy fields that include references to food production as something essentially different from non-essential economic 'goods'.
572	In fact, the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural science.
572	New technologies, such as biotechnology and computer science (for data processing and storage), and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields, including genetic engineering, agrophysics, improved statistical analysis, and precision farming.
572	Balancing these, as above, are the natural and human sciences of agricultural science that seek to understand the human-nature interactions of traditional agriculture, including interaction of religion and agriculture, and the non-material components of agricultural production systems.

573	Alchemy is an influential philosophical tradition whose early practitioners' claims to profound powers were known from antiquity.
573	The defining objectives of alchemy are varied; these include the creation of the fabled philosopher's stone possessing powers including the capability of turning base metals into the noble metals gold or silver, as well as an elixir of life conferring youth and longevity.
573	Western alchemy is recognized as a protoscience that contributed to the development of modern chemistry and medicine.
573	Alchemists developed a framework of theory, terminology, experimental process and basic laboratory techniques that are still recognizable today.
573	But alchemy differs from modern science in the inclusion of Hermetic principles and practices related to mythology, religion, and spirituality.
573	Overview The defining goals of alchemy are often given as the transmutation of common metals into gold (known as chrysopoeia), the creation of a panacea, and the discovery of a universal solvent.
573	However, this only highlights certain aspects of alchemy.
573	Alchemists have historically rewritten and evolved the explanation of their art, making a singular definition difficult.
573	H.J.
573	Sheppard gives the following as a comprehensive summary: Modern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its exoteric practical applications, and its esoteric aspects.
573	The former is pursued by historians of the physical sciences who have examined the subject in terms of proto-chemistry, medicine, and charlatanism.
573	The latter is of interest to the historians of esotericism, psychologists, spiritual and new age communities, and hermetic philosophers.
573	The subject has also made an ongoing impact on literature and the arts.
573	Despite the modern split, numerous sources stress an integration of esoteric and exoteric approaches to alchemy.
573	Holmyard, when writing on exoteric aspects, states that they can not be properly appreciated if the esoteric is not always kept in mind.
573	The prototype for this model can be found in Bolos of Mendes' third century BCE work, Physika kai Mystika ("On Physical and Mystical Matters").
573	Marie-Louise von Franz tells us the double approach of Western alchemy was set from the start, when Greek philosophy was mixed with Egyptian and Mesopotamian technology.
573	The technological, operative approach, which she calls extraverted, and the mystic, contemplative, psychological one, which she calls introverted are not mutually exclusive, but complementary instead, as meditation requires practice in the real world, and conversely.
573	Relation to the science of chemistry Practical applications of alchemy produced a wide range of contributions to medicine and the physical sciences.
573	The alchemist Robert Boyle is credited as being the father of chemistry.
573	Paracelsian iatrochemistry emphasized the medicinal application of alchemy (continued in plant alchemy, or spagyric).
573	Studies of alchemy also influenced Isaac Newton's theory of gravity.
573	Academic historical research supports that the alchemists were searching for a material substance using physical methods.
573	It is a popular belief that alchemists made contributions to the "chemical" industries of the day—ore testing and refining, metalworking, production of gunpowder, ink, dyes, paints, cosmetics, leather tanning, ceramics, glass manufacture, preparation of extracts, liquors, and so on (it seems that the preparation of aqua vitae, the "water of life", was a fairly popular "experiment" among European alchemists).
573	Alchemists contributed distillation to Western Europe.
573	The attempts of alchemists to arrange information on substances, so as to clarify and anticipate the products of their chemical reactions, resulted in early conceptions of chemical elements and the first rudimentary periodic tables.
573	They learned how to extract metals from ores, and how to compose many types of inorganic acids and bases.
573	During the 17th century, practical alchemy started to disappear in favor  of its younger offshoot chemistry, as it was renamed by Robert Boyle, the "father of modern chemistry".
573	In his book, The Skeptical Chymist, Boyle attacked Paracelsus and the natural philosophy of Aristotle, which was taught at universities.
573	However, Boyle's biographers, in their emphasis that he laid the foundations of modern chemistry, neglect how steadily he clung to the scholastic sciences and to alchemy, in theory, practice and doctrine.
573	The decline of alchemy continued in the 18th century with the birth of modern chemistry, which provided a more precise and reliable framework within a new view of the universe based on rational materialism.
573	Relation to Hermeticism In the eyes of a variety of esoteric and Hermetic practitioners, the heart of alchemy is spiritual.
573	Transmutation of lead into gold is presented as an analogy for personal transmutation, purification, and perfection.
573	This er J.
573	Hanegraaff.
573	Westernapproach is often termed 'spiritual', 'esoteric', or 'internal' alchemy.
573	Early alchemists, such as Zosimos of Panopolis (c.
573	AD 300), highlight the spiritual nature of the alchemical quest, symbolic of a religious regeneration of the human soul.
573	This approach continued in the Middle Ages, as metaphysical aspects, substances, physical states, and material processes were used as metaphors for spiritual entities, spiritual states, and, ultimately, transformation.
573	In this sense, the literal meanings of 'Alchemical Formulas' were a blind, hiding their true spiritual philosophy.
573	Practitioners and patrons such as Melchior Cibinensis and Pope Innocent VIII existed within the ranks of the church, while Martin Luther applauded alchemy for its consistency with Christian teachings.
573	Both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea symbolized evolution from an imperfect, diseased, corruptible, and ephemeral state towards a perfect, healthy, incorruptible, and everlasting state; and the philosopher's stone then represented a mystic key that would make this evolution possible.
573	Applied to the alchemist himself, the twin goal symbolized his evolution from ignorance to enlightenment, and the stone represented a hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal.
573	In texts that are written according to this view, the cryptic alchemical symbols, diagrams, and textual imagery of late alchemical works typically contain multiple layers of meanings, allegories, and references to other equally cryptic works; and must be laboriously decoded to discover their true meaning.
573	In his 1766 Alchemical Catechism, Théodore Henri de Tschudi denotes that the usage of the metals was a symbol: During the renaissance, alchemy broke into more distinct schools placing spiritual alchemists in high contrast with those working with literal metals and chemicals.
573	While most spiritual alchemists also incorporate elements of exotericism, examples of  a purely spiritual alchemy can be traced back as far as the sixteenth century, when Jacob Boehme used alchemical terminology in strictly mystical writings.
573	Another example can be found in the work of Heinrich Khunrath (1560–1605) who viewed the process of transmutation as occurring within the alchemist's soul.
573	The recent work of L.
573	M.
573	Principe and William R.
573	Newman, seeks to reject the 'spiritual interpretation' of alchemy, especially as applied to medieval, 16th and 17th century alchemy, stating it arose as a product of the Victorian occult revival.
573	There is evidence to support that some classical alchemical sources were adulterated during this time to give greater weight to the spiritual aspects of alchemy.
573	Despite this, other scholars such as Calian and Tilton reject this view as entirely historically inaccurate, drawing examples of historical spiritual alchemy from Boehme, Isaac Newton, and Michael Maier.
573	Etymology The word alchemy may derive from the Old French alquimie, which is from the Medieval Latin alchimia, and which is in turn from the Arabic al-kimia ().
573	This term itself is derived from the Ancient Greek chemeia (χημεία) or chemia (χημία) with the addition of the Arabic definite article al-  ().
573	The ancient Greek word may have been derived from a version of the Egyptian name for Egypt, which was itself based on the Ancient Egyptian word kēme (hieroglyphic Khmi, black earth, as opposed to desert sand).
573	The word could also have originally derived from the Greek chumeia (χυμεία) meaning "mixture" and referring to pharmaceutical chemistry.
573	With the later rise of alchemy in Alexandria, the word may have derived from Χημία, and thus became spelled as χημεία, and the original meaning forgotten.
573	Its etymology is still open to question.
573	History Alchemy covers several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents.
573	These traditions' general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and "genetic" relationships.
573	One can distinguish at least three major strands, which appear to be largely independent, at least in their earlier stages: Chinese alchemy, centered in China and its zone of cultural influence; Indian alchemy, centered around the Indian subcontinent; and Western alchemy, which occurred around the Mediterranean and whose center has shifted over the millennia from Greco-Roman Egypt, to the Islamic world, and finally medieval Europe.
573	Chinese alchemy was closely connected to Taoism and Indian alchemy with the Dharmic faiths, whereas Western alchemy developed its own philosophical system t[Indian religions|Dharmic faiths, whereas Western alchemy developed ithat was largely independent of, but influenced by, various Western religions.
573	It is still an open question whether these three strands share a common origin, or to what extent they influenced each other.
573	Alchemy in Greco-Roman Egypt The origin of Western alchemy may generally be traced to Hellenistic Egypt.
573	The Hellenistic city of Alexandria was a center of Greek alchemical knowledge, and retained its preeminence through most of the Greek and Roman periods.
573	Here, elements of technology, religion, mythology, and Greek philosophy, each with their own much longer histories, combined to form the earliest known records of alchemy in the West.
573	Zosimos of Panopolis wrote the oldest known books on alchemy  while Mary the Jewess is credited as being the first non-fictitious Western alchemist.
573	They wrote in Greek and lived in Egypt under Roman rule.
573	Mythology – It is claimed by Zosimos of Panopolis that alchemy dated back to pharaonic Egypt where it was the domain of the priestly class; there is little or no evidence for such a claim though.
573	Alchemical writers used Classical figures from Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythology to illuminate their works and allegorize alchemical transmutation.
573	These included the pantheon of gods related to the Classical planets, Isis, Osiris, Jason, and many others.
573	The central figure in the mythology of alchemy is Hermes Trismegistus (or Thrice-Great Hermes).
573	His name is derived from the god Thoth and his Greek counterpart Hermes.
573	Hermes and his caduceus or serpent-staff, were among alchemy's principal symbols.
573	According to Clement of Alexandria, he wrote what were called the "forty-two books of Hermes", covering all fields of knowledge.
573	The Hermetica of Thrice-Great Hermes is generally understood to form the basis for Western alchemical philosophy and practice, called the hermetic philosophy by its early practitioners.
573	These writings were collected in the first centuries of the common era.
573	Technology – The dawn of Western alchemy is sometimes associated with that of metallurgy, extending back to 3500 BCE.
573	Many writings were lost when the emperor Diocletian ordered the burning of alchemical books after suppressing a revolt in Alexandria (292 CE).
573	Few original Egyptian documents on alchemy have survived, most notable among them the Stockholm papyrus and the Leyden papyrus X.
573	Dating from 300 to 500 CE, they contained recipes for dyeing and making artificial gemstones, cleaning and fabricating pearls, and the manufacture of imitation gold and silver.
573	These writings lack the mystical, philosophical elements of alchemy, but do contain the works of Bolus of Mendes (or Pseudo-Democritus) which aligned these recipes with theoretical knowledge of astrology and the Classical elements.
573	Between the time of Bolus and Zosimos, the change took place that transformed this metallurgy into a Hermetic art.
573	Philosophy – Alexandria acted as a melting pot for philosophies of Pythagoreanism, Platonism, Stoicism and Gnosticism which formed the origin of alchemy's character.
573	An important example of alchemy's roots in Greek philosophy, originated by Empedocles and developed by Aristotle, was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements: earth, air, water, and fire.
573	According to Aristotle, each element had a sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed.
573	The four elements of the Greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter, not quantitative, as our modern elements are.
573	"...True alchemy never regarded earth, air, water, and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the present-day sense of the word.
573	The four elements are simply the primary, and most general, qualities by means of which the amorphous and purely quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form."
573	Later alchemists extensively developed the mystical aspects of this concept.
573	Alchemy coexisted alongside emerging Christianity.
573	Lactantius believed Hermes Trismegistus had prophesied its birth.
573	Augustine (354–430 CE) later affirmed this, but also condemned Trismegistus for idolatry.
573	Examples of Pagan, Christian, and Jewish alchemists can be found during this period.
573	Most of the Greco-Roman alchemists preceding Zosimos are known only by pseudonyms, such as Moses, Isis, Cleopatra, Democritus, and Ostanes.
573	Others authors such as Komarios, and Chymes, we only know through fragments of text.
573	After 400 CE, Greek alchemical writers occupied themselves solely in commenting on the works of these predecessors.
573	By the middle of the seventh century alchemy was almost an entirely mystical discipline.
573	It was at that time that Khalid Ibn Yazid sparked its migration from Alexandria to the Islamic world, facilitating the translation and preservation of Greek alchemical texts in the 8th and 9th centuries.
573	Alchemy in the Islamic world After the fall of the Roman Empire, the focus of alchemical development moved to the Islamic World.
573	Much more is known about Islamic alchemy because it was better documented: indeed, most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as Arabic transl, most of the earlier writations.
573	The word alchemy itself was derived from the Arabic word الكيمياء al-kimia.
573	The Islamic world was a melting pot for alchemy.
573	Platonic and Aristotelian thought, which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science, continued to be assimilated during the late 7th and early 8th centuries.
573	In the late 8th century, Jābir ibn Hayyān (known as "Geber" in Europe) introduced a new approach to alchemy, based on scientific methodology and controlled experimentation in the laboratory, in contrast to the ancient Greek and Egyptian alchemists whose works were often allegorical and unintelligible, with very little concern for laboratory work.
573	Jabir is thus "considered by many to be the father of chemistry", albeit others reserve that title for Robert Boyle or Antoine Lavoisier.
573	The historian of science, Paul Kraus, wrote: Jabir himself clearly recognized and proclaimed the importance of experimentation as follows: Early Islamic chemists such as Jabir Ibn Hayyan (جابر بن حيان in Arabic, Geberus in Latin; usually rendered in English as Geber), Al-Kindi (Alkindus) and Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi (Rasis or Rhazes in Latin) contributed a number of key chemical discoveries, such as the muriatic (hydrochloric acid), sulfuric and nitric acids,  and more.
573	The discovery that aqua regia, a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids, could dissolve the noblest metal, gold, was to fuel the imagination of alchemists for the next millennium.
573	Islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism.
573	The most influential author in this regard was arguably Jabir.
573	Jabir's ultimate goal was Takwin, the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory, up to and including human life.
573	He analyzed each Aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of hotness, coldness, dryness, and moistness.
573	According to Jabir, in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior.
573	For example, lead was externally cold and dry, while gold was hot and moist.
573	Thus, Jabir theorized, by rearranging the qualities of one metal, a different metal would result.
573	By this reasoning, the search for the philosopher's stone was introduced to Western alchemy.
573	Jabir developed an elaborate numerology whereby the root letters of a substance's name in Arabic, when treated with various transformations, held correspondences to the element's physical properties.
573	The elemental system used in medieval alchemy also originated with Jabir.
573	His original system consisted of seven elements, which included the five classical elements (aether, air, earth, fire and water), in addition to two chemical elements representing the metals: sulphur, 'the stone which burns', which characterized the principle of combustibility, and mercury, which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties.
573	Shortly thereafter, this evolved into eight elements, with the Arabic concept of the three metallic principles: sulphur giving flammability or combustion, mercury giving volatility and stability, and salt giving solidity.
573	The atomic theory of corpuscularianism, where all physical bodies possess an inner and outer layer of minute particles or corpuscles, also has its origins in the work of Jabir.
573	During the 9th to 14th centuries, alchemical theories faced criticism from a variety of practical Muslim chemists, including Alkindus, Abū al-Rayhān al-Bīrūnī, Abū al-Rayhān al-Bīrūnī, Avicenna and Ibn Khaldun.
573	In particular, they wrote refutations against the idea of the transmutation of metals.
573	Alchemy in Medieval Europe The introduction of alchemy to Latin Europe occurred on February 11, 1144, with the completion of Robert of Chester's translation of the Arabic Book of the Composition of Alchemy.
573	Although European craftsmen and technicians preexisted, Robert notes in his preface that alchemy was unknown in Latin Europe at the time of his writing.
573	The translation of Arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished in twelfth century Toledo, Spain, through contributors like Gerard of Cremona and Adelard of Bath.
573	Translations of the time included the Turba Philosophorum, and the works of Avicenna and al-Razi.
573	These brought with them many new words to the European vocabulary for which there was no previous Latin equivalent.
573	Alcohol, carboy, elixir, and athanor are examples.
573	Meanwhile, theologian contemporaries of the translators made strides towards the reconciliation of faith and experimental rationalism, thereby priming Europe for the influx of alchemical thought.
573	Saint Anselm (1033–1109) put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a Christian context.
573	Peter Abelard followed Anselm's work, laying the foundation for acceptance of Aristotelian thought before the first works of Aristotle reached the West.
573	Later, Robert Grosseteste (1170–1253) took Abelard's methods of analysis and added the use of observations, experimentation, and conclusions in making scientific evaluations.
573	Grosseteste also did much work to bridge Platonic and Aristotelian thinking.
573	Through much of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, alchemical knowledge in Europe remained centered around translations, and new Latin contributions were not made.
573	The efforts of the translators were succeeded by that of the encyclopaedists.
573	Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon are the most notable of these.
573	Their works explained and summarized the newly imported alchemical knowledge in Aristotelian terms.
573	There is little to suggest that Albertus Magnus (1193–1280), a Dominican, was himself an alchemist.
573	In his authentic works such as the Book of Minerals, he observed and commented on the operations and theories of alchemical authorities like Hermes and Democritus, and unnamed alchemists of his time.
573	Albertus critically compared these to the writings of Aristotle and Avicenna, where they concerned the transmutation of metals.
573	From the time shortly after his death through to the fifteenth century, twenty-eight or more alchemical tracts were misattributed to him, a common practice giving rise to his reputation as an accomplished alchemist.
573	Likewise, alchemical texts have been attributed to Albert's student Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274).
573	Roger Bacon (1214–1294) was an Oxford Franciscan who studied a wide variety of topics including optics, languages and medicine.
573	After studying the Pseudo-Aristotelian Secretum Secretorum around 1247, he dramatically shifted his studies towards a vision of a universal science which included alchemy and astrology.
573	Bacon maintained that Albertus Magnus' ignorance of the fundamentals of alchemy prevented a complete picture of wisdom.
573	While alchemy was not more important to him than any of the other sciences, and he did not produce symbolic allegorical works, Bacon's contributions advanced alchemy's connections to soteriology and Christian theology.
573	Bacon's writings demonstrated an integration of morality, salvation, alchemy, and the prolongation of life.
573	His correspondence with Pope Clement IV highlighted this integration, calling attention to the importance of alchemy to the papacy.
573	Like the Greeks before him, Bacon acknowledged the division of alchemy into the practical and theoretical.
573	He noted that the theoretical lay outside the scope of Aristotle, the natural philosophers, and all Latin writers of his time.
573	The practical however, confirmed the theoretical through experiment, and Bacon advocated its uses in natural science and medicine.
573	Soon after Bacon, the influential work of Pseudo-Geber (sometimes identified as Paul of Taranto) appeared.
573	His Summa Perfectionis remained a staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods.
573	It was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur-mercury theory, and the unusual clarity with which they were described.
573	By the end of the 13th century, alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief.
573	Adepts believed in the macrocosm-microcosm theories of Hermes, that is to say, they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body (for example, if one could learn the secret of purifying gold, one could use the technique to purify the human soul).
573	They believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above, and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded jargon set with traps to mislead the uninitiated.
573	Finally, the alchemists practiced their art: they actively experimented with chemicals and made observations and theories about how the universe operated.
573	Their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man's soul was divided within himself after the fall of Adam.
573	By purifying the two parts of man's soul, man could be reunited with God.
573	In the 14th century, alchemy became more accessible to Europeans outside the confines of Latin speaking churchmen and scholars.
573	Alchemical discourse shifted from scholarly philosophical debate to an exposed social commentary on the alchemists themselves.
573	Dante, Piers the Ploughman, and Chaucer all painted unflattering pictures of alchemists as thieves and liars.
573	Pope John XXII's 1317 edict, Spondent quas non exhibent forbade the false promises of transmutaope John XXII's 1317 edict, tion made by pseudo-alchemists.
573	In 1403, Henry IV of England banned the practice of multiplying metals (Although it was possible to buy a licence to attempt to make gold alchemically, and a number were granted by Henry VI and Edward IV ).
573	These critiques and regulations centered more around pseudo-alchemical charlatanism than the actual study of alchemy, which continued with an increasingly Christian tone.
573	The 14th century saw the Christian imagery of death and resurrection employed in the alchemical texts of Petrus Bonus, John of Rupescissa and in works written in the name of Raymond Lull and Arnold of Villanova.
573	Nicolas Flamel is a well known alchemist, but a good example of pseudepigraphy, the practice of giving your works the name of someone else, usually more famous.
573	Though the historical Flamel existed, the writings and legends assigned to him only appeared in 1612.
573	Flamel was not a religious scholar as were many of his predecessors, and his entire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the philosopher's stone.
573	His work spends a great deal of time describing the processes and reactions, but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations.
573	Most of 'his' work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him, especially as regarded the philosopher's stone.
573	Through the late Middle Ages (1300–1500) alchemists were much like Flamel: they concentrated on looking for the philosophers' stone.
573	Bernard Trevisan and George Ripley made similar contributions in the 14th and 15th centuries .
573	Their cryptic allusions and symbolism led to wide variations in interpretation of the art.
573	Alchemy in the Renaissance and modern age During the Renaissance, Hermetic and Platonic foundations were restored to European alchemy.
573	The dawn of medical, pharmaceutical, occult, and entrepreneurial branches of alchemy followed.
573	In the late fifteenth century, Marsilo Ficino translated the Corpus Hermeticum and the works of Plato into Latin.
573	These were previously unavailable to Europeans who for the first time had a full picture of the alchemical theory that Bacon had declared absent.
573	Renaissance Humanism and Renaissance Neoplatonism guided alchemists away from physics to refocus on mankind as the alchemical vessel.
573	Esoteric systems developed that blended alchemy into a broader occult Hermeticism, fusing it with magic, astrology, and Christian cabala.
573	A key figure in this development was German Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa (1486–1535) who received his Hermetic education in Italy in the schools of the humanists.
573	In his De Occulta Philosophia he attempted to merge Kabbalah, Hermetism, and alchemy.
573	He was instrumental in spreading this new blend of Hermeticism outside the borders of Italy.
573	Philippus Aureolus Paracelsus, (Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, 1493–1541) cast alchemy into a new form, rejecting some of Agrippa’s occultism and moving away from chrysopoeia.
573	Paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine, and wrote "Many have said of Alchemy, that it is for the making of gold and silver.
573	For me such is not the aim, but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines."
573	His hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man the microcosm and Nature the macrocosm.
573	He took an approach different from those before him, using this analogy not in the manner of soul-purification but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies, and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them.
573	Paracelsian practical alchemy, especially herbal medicine and plant remedies has since been named spagyrics (a synonym for alchemy from the Greek words meaning to separate and to join together, based on the Latin alchemic maxim: solve et coagula).
573	Iatrochemistry also refers to the pharmaceutical applications of alchemy championed by Paracelsus.
573	John Dee (13 July 1527 – December, 1608) followed Agrippa’s occult tradition.
573	Though better known for angel summoning, divination, and his role as astrologer, cryptographer, and consultant to Queen Elizabeth I, Dee’s alchemical Monas Hieroglyphica, written in 1564 was his most popular and influential work.
573	His writing portrayed alchemy as a sort of terrestrial astronomy in line with the Hermetic axiom As above so below.
573	Entrepreneurial opportunities were not uncommon for the alchemists of Renaissance Europe.
573	Alchemists were contracted by the elite for practical purposes related to mining, medical services, and the production of chemicals, medicines, metals, and gemstones.
573	Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, in the late 16th century, famously received and sponsored various alchemists at his court in Prague, including Dee and his associate Edward Kelley.
573	King James IV of Scotland, Julius, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Henry V, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Augustus, Elector of Saxony, Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn, and Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel all contracted alchemists.
573	John’s son Arthur Dee worked as a court physician to Michael I of Russia and Charles I of England but also compiled the alchemical book Fasciculus Chemicus.
573	Though most of these appointments were legitimate, the trendical book Fasciculus Chemicus.
573	Though mo of pseudo-alchemical fraud continued through the Renaissance.
573	Betrüger would use sleight of hand, or claims of secret knowledge to make money or secure patronage.
573	Legitimate mystical and medical alchemists such as Michael Maier and Heinrich Khunrath wrote about fraudulent transmutations, distinguishing themselves from the con artists.
573	False alchemists were sometimes prosecuted for fraud.
573	The terms "chemia" and "alchemia" were used as synonyms in the early modern period, and the differences between alchemy, chemistry and small-scale assaying and metallurgy were not as neat as in the present day.
573	There were important overlaps between practitioners, and trying to classify them into alchemists, chemists and craftsmen is anachronistic.
573	For example, Tycho Brahe (1546–1601), an alchemist better known for his astronomical and astrological investigations, had a laboratory built at his Uraniborg observatory/research institute.
573	Michael Sendivogius (Michał Sędziwój, 1566–1636), a Polish alchemist, philosopher, medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry wrote mystical works but is also credited with distilling oxygen in a lab sometime around 1600.
573	Sendivogious taught his technique to Cornelius Drebbel who, in 1621, applied this in a submarine.
573	Isaac Newton devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy (see Isaac Newton's occult studies) than he did to either optics or physics.
573	Other early modern alchemists who were eminent in their other studies include Robert Boyle, and Jan Baptist van Helmont.
573	Their Hermetism complemented rather than precluded their practical achievements in medicine and science.
573	The decline of Western alchemy The demise of Western alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for "ancient wisdom".
573	Although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the 17th century, alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years, and in fact may have reached its apogee in the 18th century.
573	As late as 1781 James Price claimed to have produced a powder that could transmute mercury into silver or gold.
573	Robert Boyle (1627–1691), better known for his studies of gases (cf.
573	Boyle's law) pioneered the scientific method in chemical investigations.
573	He assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data; in a typical experiment, Boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out, the wind characteristics, the position of the Sun and Moon, and the barometer reading, all just in case they proved to be relevant.
573	This approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the 18th and 19th centuries, based on revolutionary discoveries of Lavoisier and John Dalton — which finally provided a logical, quantitative and reliable framework for understanding matter transmutations, and revealed the futility of longstanding alchemical goals such as the philosopher's stone.
573	Meanwhile, Paracelsian alchemy led to the development of modern medicine.
573	Experimentalists gradually uncovered the workings of the human body, such as blood circulation (Harvey, 1616), and eventually traced many diseases to infections with germs (Koch and Pasteur, 19th century) or lack of natural nutrients and vitamins (Lind, Eijkman, Funk, et al.).
573	Supported by parallel developments in organic chemistry, the new science easily displaced alchemy from its medical roles, interpretive and prescriptive, while deflating its hopes of miraculous elixirs and exposing the ineffectiveness or even toxicity of its remedies.
573	During the seventeenth century, a short-lived "supernatural" interpretation of alchemy become popular, including support by fellows of the Royal Society: Robert Boyle and Elias Ashmole.
573	Proponents of the supernatural interpretation of alchemy believed that the philosopher's stone might be used to summon and communicate with angels.
573	The words "alchemy" and "chemistry" were used interchangeably during most of the seventeenth century; only during the eighteenth century was a distinction drawn rigidly between the two.
573	In the eighteenth century, "alchemy" was considered to be restricted to the realm of "gold making", leading to the popular belief that most, if not all, alchemists were charlatans, and the tradition itself nothing more than a fraud.
573	The obscure and secretive writings of the alchemists was used as a case by those who wished to forward a fraudulent and non-scientific opinion of alchemy.
573	In order to protect the developing science of modern chemistry from the negative censure of which alchemy was being subjected, academic writers during the scientific Enlightenment attempted, for the sake of survival, to separate and divorce the "new" chemistry from the "old" practices of alchemy.
573	This move was mostly successful, and the consequences of this continued into the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and even to the present day.
573	During the occult revival of the early nineteenth century, alchemy received new attention as an occult science.
573	The esoteric or occultist school, which arose during the nineteenth century, held (and continues to hold) the view that the substances and operations mentioned in alchemical literature are to be interpreted in a spiritual sense, and it downplays the role of the alchemy as a practical tradition or protoscience.
573	This interpretation further forwarded the view that alchemy is an art primarily concerned with spiritual enlightenment or illumination, as opposed to the physical manipulation of apparatus and chemicals, and claims that the obscure language of the alchemical texts were an allegorical guise for spiritual, moral or mystical processes.
573	In the nineteenth century revival of alchemy, the two most seminal figures were Mary Anne Atwood,  and Ethan Allen Hitchcock who independently published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy.
573	Both forwarded a completely esoteric view of alchemy, as Atwood claimed: "No modern art or chemistry, notwithstanding all its surreptitious claims, has any thing in common with Alchemy."
573	Atwood's work influenced subsequent authors of the occult revival including Eliphas Levi, Arthur Edward Waite, and Rudolf Steiner.
573	Hitchhe occult revival includingcock, in his Remarks Upon Alchymists (1855) attempted to make a case for his spiritual interpretation with his claim that the alchemists wrote about a spiritual discipline under a materialistic guise in order to avoid accusations of blasphemy from the church and state.
573	In 1845, Baron Carl Reichenbach, published his studies on Odic force, a concept with some similarities to alchemy, but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion.
573	Indian alchemy According to Multhauf & Gilbert (2008): The oldest Indian writings, the Vedas (Hindu sacred scriptures), contain the same hints of alchemy that are found in evidence from ancient China, namely vague references to a connection between gold and long life.
573	Mercury, which was so vital to alchemy everywhere, is first mentioned in the 4th- to 3rd-century-BC Artha-śāstra, about the same time it is encountered in China and in the West.
573	Evidence of the idea of transmuting base metals to gold appears in 2nd- to 5th-century-AD Buddhist texts, about the same time as in the West.
573	Since Alexander the Great had invaded Ancient India in 325 BC, leaving a Greek state (Gandhāra) that long endured, the possibility exists that the Indians acquired the idea from the Greeks, but it could have been the other way around.
573	Significant progress in alchemy was made in ancient India.
573	Will Durant wrote in Our Oriental Heritage: An 11th century Persian chemist and physician named Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī reported that they "have a science similar to alchemy which is quite peculiar to them, which in Sanskrit is called Rasayāna and in Persian Rasavātam.
573	It means the art of obtaining/manipulating Rasa: nectar, mercury, and juice.
573	This art was restricted to certain operations, metals, drugs, compounds, and medicines, many of which have mercury as their core element.
573	Its principles restored the health of those who were ill beyond hope and gave back youth to fading old age."
573	One thing is sure though, Indian alchemy like every other Indian science is focused on finding Moksha: perfection, immortality, liberation.
573	As such it focuses its efforts on transmutation of the human body: from mortal to immortal.
573	Many are the traditional stories of alchemists still alive since time immemorial due to the effects of their experiments.
573	Since alchemy eventually became ingrained in the vast field of Indian erudition, influences from other metaphysical and philosophical doctrines such as Samkhya, Yoga, Vaisheshika and Ayurveda were inevitable.
573	Nonetheless, most of the Rasayāna texts track their origins back to Kaula tantric schools associated to the teachings of the personality of Matsyendranath.
573	Two famous early Indian alchemical authors were Nāgārjuna Siddha and Nityanātha Siddha.
573	Nāgārjuna Siddha was a Buddhist or Jaina monk.
573	His book, Rasendramangalam, is an example of Indian alchemy and medicine.
573	Nityanātha Siddha wrote Rasaratnākara, also a highly influential work.
573	In Sanskrit, "rasa" translates as "mercury" and Nāgārjuna Siddha was said to have developed a method or converting mercury into gold.
573	Reliable scholarship on Indian alchemy has been advanced in a major way by the publication of The Alchemical Body by David Gordon White.
573	Trustworthy scholarship on Indian alchemy must now take the findings of this work into account.
573	An important modern bibliography on Indian alchemical studies has also been provided by David Gordon White at [http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195399318/obo-9780195399318-0046.xml?rskeyskoSqW&result 1&q=rasayana#firstMatch Oxford Bibliographies Online].
573	Chinese alchemy Whereas Western alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into noble ones, Chinese alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine.
573	The philosopher's stone of European alchemists can be compared to the Grand Elixir of Immortality sought by Chinese alchemists.
573	However, in the hermetic view, these two goals were not unconnected, and the philosopher's stone was often equated with the universal panacea; therefore, the two traditions may have had more in common than initially appears.
573	Black powder may have been an important invention of Chinese alchemists.
573	Described in 9th century texts and used in fireworks in China by the 10th century, it was used in cannons by 1290.
573	From China, the use of gunpowder spread to Japan, the Mongols, the Arab world, and Europe.
573	Gunpowder was used by the Mongols against the Hungarians in 1241, and in Europe by the 14th century.
573	Chinese alchemy was closely connected to Taoist forms of traditional Chinese medicine, such as Acupuncture and Moxibustion, and to martial arts such as Tai Chi Chuan and Kung Fu (although some Tai Chi schools believe that their art derives from the philosophical or hygienic branches of Taoism, not Alchemical).
573	In fact, in the early Song Dynasty, followers of this Taoist idea (chiefly the elite and upper class) would ingest mercuric sulfide, which, though tolerable in low levels, led many to suicide.
573	Thinking that this consequential death would lead to freedom and access to the Taoist heavens, the ensuing deaths encouraged people to eschew this method of alchemy in favor of external sources (the aforementioned Tai Chi Chuan, mastering of the Qi, etc.).
573	Alchemy as a subject of historical research The history of alchemy has become a significant and recognized subject of academtorical research The historyic study.
573	As the language of the alchemists is analyzed, historians are becoming more aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of Western cultural history, such as the evolution of science and philosophy, the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities, kabbalism, spiritualism, Rosicrucianism, and other mystic movements.
573	Institutions involved in this research include The Chymistry of Isaac Newton project at Indiana University, the University of Exeter Centre for the Study of Esotericism (EXESESO), the European Society for the Study of Western Esotericism (ESSWE), and the University of Amsterdam's Sub-department for the History of Hermetic Philosophy and Related Currents.
573	A large collection of books on alchemy is kept in the Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica in Amsterdam.
573	Journals which publish regularly on the topic of Alchemy include 'Ambix', published by the Society for the History of alchemy and Chemistry, and 'Isis', published by The History of Science Society.
573	Modern alchemy Due to the complexity and obscurity of alchemical literature, and the eighteenth century disappearance of remaining alchemical practitioners into the area of chemistry; the general understanding of alchemy in the general public, modern practitioners, and also many historians of science, have been strongly influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations.
573	Hundreds of books including adulterated translations of classical alchemical literature were published throughout the early nineteenth century.
573	Many of these continue to be reprinted today by esoteric book publishing houses, along with modern books on spiritual alchemy and poor translations of older alchemical texts.
573	These are then used as sources by modern authors to support spiritual interpretations.
573	Over half of the books on alchemy published since 1970 support spiritual interpretations, mostly using previously adulterated documents to support their conclusions.
573	Many of these books continue to be taken seriously, even appearing in university bookshelves.
573	Esoteric interpretations of alchemy remain strong to this day, and continue to influence both the public and academic perceptions of the history of alchemy.
573	Today, numerous esoteric alchemical groups continue to perpetuate modern interpretations of alchemy, sometimes merging in concepts from New Age or radical environmentalism movements.
573	Rosicrucians and freemasons have a continued interest in alchemy and its symbolism.
573	Alchemy in traditional medicine Traditional medicine sometimes involves the transmutation of natural substances, using pharmacological or a combination of pharmacological and spiritual techniques.
573	In Ayurveda the samskaras are claimed to transform heavy metals and toxic herbs in a way that removes their toxicity.
573	These processes are actively used to the present day.
573	Twentieth century spagyrists Albert Richard Riedel and Jean Dubuis merged Paracelsian alchemy with occultism, teaching laboratory pharmaceutical methods.
573	The schools they founded, Les Philosophes de la Nature and The Paracelsus Research Society, popularized modern spagyrics including the manufacture of herbal tinctures and products.
573	The courses, books, organizations, and conferences generated by their students continue to influence popular applications of alchemy as a new age medicinal practice.
573	Psychology  Alchemical symbolism has been used by psychologists such as Carl Jung who reexamined alchemical symbolism and theory and presented the inner meaning of alchemical work as a spiritual path.
573	Jung was deeply interested in the occult since his youth, participating in seances, which he used as the basis for his doctoral dissertation "On the Psychology and Pathology of So-Called Occult Phenomena."
573	In 1913, Jung had already adopted a "spiritualist and redemptive interpretation of alchemy", likely reflecting his interest in the occult literature of the nineteenth century.
573	Jung began writing his views on alchemy from the 1920s and continued until the end of his life.
573	His interpretation of Chinese alchemical texts in terms of his analytical psychology also served the function of comparing Eastern and Western alchemical imagery and core concepts and hence its possible inner sources (archetypes).
573	Jung saw alchemy as a Western proto-psychology dedicated to the achievement of individuation.
573	In his interpretation, alchemy was the vessel by which Gnosticism survived its various purges into the Renaissance, a concept also followed by others such as Stephan A.
573	Hoeller.
573	In this sense, Jung viewed alchemy as comparable to a Yoga of the East, and more adequate to the Western mind than Eastern religions and philosophies.
573	The practice of Alchemy seemed to change the mind and spirit of the Alchemist.
573	Conversely, spontaneous changes on the mind of Western people undergoing any important stage in individuation seems to produce, on occasion, imagery known to Alchemy and relevant to the person's situation.
573	Jung did not completely reject the material experiments of the alchemists, but he massively downplayed it, writing that the transmutation was performed in the mind of the alchemist.
573	He claimed theplayed it, writi material substances and procedures were only a projection of the alchemists' internal state, while the real substance to be transformed was the mind itself.
573	Marie-Louise von Franz, a disciple of Jung, continued Jung's studies on alchemy and its psychological meaning.
573	Jung's work exercised a great influence on the mainstream perception of alchemy, his approach becoming a stock element in many popular texts on the subject to this day.
573	Modern scholars are sometimes critical of the Jungian approach to alchemy as overly reflective of nineteenth century occultism.
573	Magnum opus  The Great Work of Alchemy is often described as a series of four stages represented by colors.
573	Alchemy in art and entertainment  Alchemy has had a long standing relationship with art, seen both in alchemical texts and in mainstream entertainment.
573	Literary alchemy appears throughout the history of English literature from Shakespeare to J.
573	K.
573	Rowling.
573	Here, characters or plot structure follow an alchemical magnum opus.
573	In the fourteenth century, Chaucer began a trend of alchemical satire that can still be seen in recent fantasy works like those of Terry Pratchett.
573	Visual artists had a similar relationship with alchemy.
573	While some of them used alchemy as a source of satire, others worked with the alchemists themselves or integrated alchemical thought or symbols in their work.
573	Music was also present in the works of alchemists and continues to influence popular performers.
573	In the last hundred years, alchemists have been portrayed in a magical and spagyric role in fantasy fiction, film, television, comics and video games.

580	An astronomer is a scientist who studies celestial bodies such as moons, planets, stars, nebulae, and galaxies); the physics, chemistry, and evolution of such objects; and phenomena that originate outside the atmosphere of Earth (such as supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic background radiation).
580	A related but distinct subject, cosmology, is concerned with studying the universe as a whole.
580	Historically, astronomy was more concerned with the classification and description of phenomena in the sky, while astrophysics attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using physical laws.
580	Today, that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms "astronomer" and "astrophysicist" are interchangeable.
580	Professional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have a PhD in physics or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities.
580	They spend the majority of their time working on research, although they quite often have other duties such as teaching, builf their tiding instruments, or aiding in the operation of an observatory.
580	The number of professional astronomers in the United States is actually quite small.
580	The American Astronomical Society, which is the major organization of professional astronomers in North America, has approximately 7,700 members.
580	This number includes scientists from other fields such as physics, geology, and engineering, whose research interests are closely related to astronomy.
580	The International Astronomical Union comprises almost 10,145 members from 70 different countries who are involved in astronomical research at the PhD level and beyond.
580	While the number of professional astronomers worldwide is not much larger than the population of a small town, there is a huge community of amateur astronomers.
580	Most cities have amateur astronomy clubs that meet on a regular basis and often host star parties in their communities.
580	The Astronomical Society of the Pacific is the largest general astronomical society in the world, comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from 70 different nations.
580	Like any hobby, most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote a few hours a month to stargazing and reading the latest developments in research.
580	However, amateurs span the range from so-called "armchair astronomers" to the very ambitious, who own science-grade telescopes and instruments with which they are able to make their own discoveries and assist professional astronomers in research.
580	Modern astronomers Contrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a telescope through the dark hours of the night, it is very rare for a modern professional astronomer to use an eyepiece on a larger telescope.
580	It is far more common to use a charge-coupled device camera to record a long, deep exposure, allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the light is added over time.
580	Before CCDs, photographic plates were a common method of observation.
580	Modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes - most spend a few weeks per year observing, and the rest of their time reducing the data (changing it from raw data to processed images) and analyzing it.
580	Many astronomers work entirely from astronomical survey or space observatory data.
580	Others work with radio telescopes like the Very Large Array, which is entirely automated, although it is maintained by telescope operators.
580	Some astronomers do not work with data at all, but instead use computational simulations or analytical models to provide analysis of observed phenomena or make predictions for observational astronomers.
580	Astronomers who serve as faculty spend much of their time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes.
580	Most universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometimes planetariums as a public service to encourage interest in the field.
584	Amoeboids are single-celled life-forms characterized by an irregular shape.
584	"Amoeboid" and "amœba" are often used interchangeably even by biologists, and especially refer to a creature moving by using pseudopodia.
584	Most references to "amoebas" or "amoebae" are to amoeboids in general rather than to the specific genus Amoeba.
584	The genus Amoeba and amoeboids in general both derive their names from the ancient Greek word for change.
584	Structure Amoeboids move using pseudopodia, which are bulges of cytoplasm.
584	Amoebas breathe using their entire cell membrane that is constantly immersed in water.
584	Excess water can cross into the cytosol.
584	Amoebas have a contractile vacuole to expel excess water.
584	Food sources vary in amoeboids.
584	They may consume bacteria or vacuole to expel excother protists.
584	Some are detritivores and eat dead organic material.
584	They extend a pair of pseudopodia around food.
584	They fuse to make a food vacuole which then fuses with a lysosome to add digestive chemicals.
584	Undigested food is expelled at the cell membrane.
584	Amoebas use pseudopodia to move and feed.
584	They are powered by flexibe microfilaments near the membrane.
584	Microfilaments are at least 50% of the cytoskeleton.
584	The other parts are more stiff and are composed of intermediate filaments and microtubules.
584	These are not used in amoeboid movement, but are stiff skeletons on which organelles are supported or can move on.
584	The shells of amoebas are often composed of calcium.
584	The proteins or materials are synthesised in the cell and exported just outside the cell membrane.
584	Multicellular amoebas: Slime molds Amoebas seem to have connections with two phyla (now defunct) composed of multicellular organisms of the lineage of fungus-like protists, the so-called slime molds.
584	These two defunct phyla were the Myxomycota (i.e., plasmodial slime molds, now classified in the taxon Myxogastria), and Acrasiomycota (i.e.
584	Acrasida and Dictyosteliida).
584	These two phyla use amoeboid movement in their feeding stage.
584	The former is basically a giant multinucleate amoeba, while the latter lives solitary until food runs out; in which a colony of these functions as a unit.
584	Myxomycete slime molds use amoeboid gametes, as well.
584	Diversity They have appeared in a number of different groups.
584	Some cells in multicellular animals may be amoeboid, for instance human white blood cells, which consume pathogens.
584	Many protists also exist as individual amoeboid cells, or take such a form at some point in their life-cycle.
584	The most famous such organism is Amoeba proteus; the name amoeba is variously used to describe its close relatives, other organisms similar to it, or the amoeboids in general.
584	Classification As amoebas themselves are polyphyletic and subject to some imprecision in definition, the term "amoeboid" does not provide identification of an organism, and is better understood as description of locomotion.
584	When used in the broader sense, the term can include many different groups.
584	One source includes 97 different genera.
584	Others include far fewer.
584	Older classification In older classification systems, amoeboids, under the taxon name Sarcodina, had been divided into several morphological categories based on the form and structure of their pseudopods.
584	Amoeboids with pseudopods supported by regular arrays of microtubules were called actinopods, whereas those that weren't were called rhizopods, which were further subdivided into lobose, filose, and reticulose amoebae.
584	In contrast to "rhizopods", where most of their morphologies can be mapped to modern classification systems, "actinopods" appear to be extensively polyphyletic.
584	Actinopods are divided into radiolaria and heliozoa (itself a polyphyletic grouping).
584	Finally, there was also a strange group of giant marine amoeboids, the xenophyophores, that did not fall into any of these categories.
584	Modern classification More modern classifications are based upon cladistics.
584	It has been stated that most amoeboid are now grouped in Amoebozoa or Rhizaria.
584	However, in contexts where "amoeboid" is defined more loosely, there are many amoeboid species that are in the Excavata clade.
584	Phylogenetic analyses place these genera into the following groups (not all of these are considered amoeboid (or "amoebas") by all sources): Pathogenic interactions with other organisms Some amoeboids can infect other organisms pathogenically (causing disease): *Entamoeba histolytica is the cause of amoebiasis, or amoebic dysentery.
584	Naegleria fowleri (the "brain-eating amoeba") is a fresh-water-native species that can be fatal to humans if introduced through the nose.
584	Acanthamoeba can cause amoebic keratitis and encephalitis in humans.
584	Balamuthia mandrillaris is the cause of (often fatal) granulomatous amoebic meningoencephalitis
586	The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII, ;) is a character-encoding scheme originally based on the English alphabet.
586	ASCII codes represent text in computers, communications equipment, and other devices that use text.
586	Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, though they support many additional characters.
586	ASCII developed from telegraphic codes.
586	Its first commercial use was as a seven-bit teleprinter code promoted by Bell data services.
586	Work on the ASCII standard began on October 6, 1960, with the first meeting of the American Standards Association's (ASA) X3.2 subcommittee.
586	The first edition of the standard was published during 1963, a major revision during 1967, and the most recent update during 1986.
586	Compared to earlier telegraph codes, the proposed Bell code and ASCII were both ordered for more convenient sorting (i.e., alphabetization) of lists, and added features for devices other than teleprinters.
586	ASCII includes definitions for 128 characters: 33 are non-printing control characters (many now obsolete) that affect how text and space are processed and 95 printable characters, including the space (which is considered an invisible graphic).
586	The IANA prefers the name US-ASCII to avoid ambiguity.
586	ASCII was the most commonly used character encoding on the World Wide Web until December 2007, when it was surpassed by UTF-8.
586	History The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) was developed under the auspices of a committee of the American Standards Association, called the X3 committee, by its X3.2 (later X3L2) subcommittee, and later by that subcommittee's X3.2.4 working group.
586	The ASA became the United States of America Standards Institute or USASI and ultimately the American National Standards Institute.
586	The X3.2 subcommittee designed ASCII based on the earlier teleprinter encoding systems.
586	Like other character encodings, ASCII specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and character symbols (i.e.
586	This allows digital devices to communicate with each other and to process, store, and communicate character-oriented information such as written language.
586	Before ASCII was developed, the encodings in use included 26 alphabetic characters, 10 nI was developeumerical digits, and from 11 to 25 special graphic symbols.
586	To include all these, and control characters compatible with the Comité Consultatif International Téléphonique et Télégraphique (CCITT) International Telegraph Alphabet No.
586	ITA2) standard, Fieldata, and early EBCDIC, more than 64 codes were required for ASCII.
586	The committee debated the possibility of a shift key function (like the Baudot code), which would allow more than 64 codes to be represented by six bits.
586	In a shifted code, some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes.
586	It allows compact encoding, but is less reliable for data transmission; an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable.
586	The standards committee decided against shifting, and so ASCII required at least a seven-bit code.
586	The committee considered an eight-bit code, since eight bits (octets) would allow two four-bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with binary coded decimal.
586	However, it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice.
586	The committee voted to use a seven-bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission.
586	Since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position, it also allowed for a parity bit for error checking if desired.
586	Eight-bit machines (with octets as the native data type) that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to 0.
586	The code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together, and all graphic codes were together, for ease of identification.
586	The first two columns (32 positions) were reserved for control characters.} The "space" character had to come before graphics to make sorting easier, so it became position 20hex; for the same reason, many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits.
586	The committee decided it was important to support upper case 64-character alphabets, and chose to pattern ASCII so it could be reduced easily to a usable 64-character set of graphic codes.
586	Lower case letters were therefore not interleaved with upper case.
586	To keep options available for lower case letters and other graphics, the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters, and the letter "A" was placed in position 41hex to match the draft of the corresponding British standard.
586	The digits 0–9 were arranged so they correspond to values in binary prefixed with 011, making conversion with binary-coded decimal straightforward.
586	Many of the non-alphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters.
586	Thus #, $ and % were placed to correspond to 3, 4, and 5 in the adjacent column.
586	The parentheses could not correspond to 9 and 0, however, because the place corresponding to 0 was taken by the space character.
586	Since many European typewriters placed the parentheses with 8 and 9, those corresponding positions were chosen for the parentheses.
586	The @ symbol was not used in continental Europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented À in the French variation, so the @ was placed in position 40hex next to the letter A.
586	The control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message (SOM), end of address (EOA), end of message (EOM), end of transmission (EOT), "who are you?"
586	WRU), "are you?"
586	RU), a reserved device control (DC0), synchronous idle (SYNC), and acknowledge (ACK).
586	These were positioned to maximize the Hamming distance between their bit patterns.
586	With the other special characters and control codes filled in, ASCII was published as ASA X3.4-1963, leaving 28 code positions without any assigned meaning, reserved for future standardization, and one unassigned control code.
586	There was some debate at the time whether there should be more control characters rather than the lower case alphabet.
586	The indecision did not last long: during May 1963 the CCITT Working Party on the New Telegraph Alphabet proposed to assign lower case characters to columns 6 and 7, and International Organization for Standardization TC 97 SC 2 voted during October to incorporate the change into its draft standard.
586	The X3.2.4 task group voted its approval for the change to ASCII at its May 1963 meeting.
586	Locating the lowercase letters in columns 6 and 7 caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by a single bit, which simplified case-insensitive character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers.
586	The X3 committee made other changes, including other new characters (the brace and vertical line characters), renaming some control characters (SOM became start of header (SOH)) and moving or removing others (RU was removed).
586	ASCII was subsequently updated as USASI X3.4-1967, then USASI X3.4-1968, ANSI X3.4-1977, and finally, ANSI X3.4-1986 (the first two are occasionally retronamed ANSI X3.4-1967, and ANSI X3.4-1968).
586	The X3 committee also addressed how ASCII should be transmitted (least significant bit first), and how it should be recorded on perforated tape.
586	They proposed a 9-track standard for magnetic tape, and attempted to deal with some forms of punched card formats.
586	ASCII itself was first used commercially during 1963 as a seven-bit teleprinter code for American Telephone & Telegraph's TWX (TeletypeWriter eXchange) network.
586	TWX originally used the earlier five-bit Baudot code, which was also used by the competing Telex teleprinter system.
586	Bob Bemer introduced features such as the escape sequence.
586	His British colleague Hugh McGregor Ross helped to popularize this work—according to Bemer, "so much so that the code that was to become ASCII was first called the Bemer-Ross Code in Europe".
586	Because of his extensive work on ASCII, Bemer has been called "the father of ASCII."
586	On March 11, 1968, U.S.
586	President Lyndon B.
586	Johnson mandated that all computers purchased by the United States federal government support ASCII, stating: I have also approved recommendations of the Secretary of Commerce regarding standards for recording the Standard Cproved recommendations of thode for Information Interchange on magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in computer operations.
586	All computers and related equipment configurations brought into the Federal Government inventory on and after July 1, 1969, must have the capability to use the Standard Code for Information Interchange and the formats prescribed by the magnetic tape and paper tape standards when these media are used.
586	Other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as ISO/IEC 646 that are identical or nearly identical to ASCII, with extensions for characters outside the English alphabet and symbols used outside the United States, such as the symbol for the United Kingdom's pound sterling (£).
586	Almost every country needed an adapted version of ASCII, since ASCII suited the needs of only the USA and a few other countries.
586	For example, Canada had its own version that supported French characters.
586	Other adapted encodings include ISCII (India), VISCII (Vietnam), and YUSCII (Yugoslavia).
586	Although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ASCII, true ASCII is  defined strictly only by ANSI standard.
586	ASCII was incorporated into the Unicode character set as the first 128 symbols, so the ASCII characters have the same numeric codes in both sets.
586	This allows UTF-8 to be backward compatible with ASCII, a significant advantage.
586	ASCII control characters ASCII reserves the first 32 codes (numbers 0–31 decimal) for control characters: codes originally intended not to represent printable information, but rather to control devices (such as printers) that make use of ASCII, or to provide meta-information about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape.
586	For example, character 10 represents the "line feed" function (which causes a printer to advance its paper), and character 8 represents "backspace".
586	RFC 2822 refers to control characters that do not include carriage return, line feed or white space as non-whitespace control characters.
586	Except for the control characters that prescribe elementary line-oriented formatting, ASCII does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document.
586	Other schemes, such as markup languages, address page and document layout and formatting.
586	The original ASCII standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character.
586	The ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional (where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a data stream) and sometimes accidental (such as what "delete" means).
586	Probably the most influential single device on the interpretation of these characters was the Teletype Model 33 ASR, which was a printing terminal with an available paper tape reader/punch option.
586	Paper tape was a very popular medium for long-term program storage until the 1980s, less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape.
586	In particular, the Teletype Model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 (Control-Q, DC1, also known as XON), 19 (Control-S, DC3, also known as XOFF), and 127 (Delete) became de facto standards.
586	Because the keytop for the O key also showed a left-arrow symbol (from ASCII-1963, which had this character instead of underscore), a noncompliant use of code 15 (Control-O, Shift In) interpreted as "delete previous character" was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected.
586	The use of Control-S (XOFF, an abbreviation for transmit off) as a "handshaking" signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow, and Control-Q (XON, "transmit on") to resume sending, persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique.
586	On some systems Control-S retains its meaning but Control-Q is replaced by a second Control-S to resume output.
586	Code 127 is officially named "delete" but the Teletype label was "rubout".
586	Since the original standard did not give detailed interpretation for most control codes, interpretations of this code varied.
586	The original Teletype meaning, and the intent of the standard, was to make it an ignored character, the same as NUL (all zeroes).
586	This was useful specifically for paper tape, because punching the all-ones bit pattern on top of an existing mark would obliterate it.
586	Tapes designed to be "hand edited" could even be produced with spaces of extra NULs (blank tape) so that a block of characters could be "rubbed out" and then replacements put into the empty space.
586	As video terminals began to replace printing ones, the value of the "rubout" character was lost.
586	DEC systems, for example, interpreted "Delete" to mean "remove the character before the cursor" and this interpretation also became common in Unix systems.
586	Most other systems used "Backspace" for that meaning and used "Delete" to mean "remove the character at the cursor".
586	That latter interpretation is the most common now.
586	Many more of the control codes have been given meanings quite different from their original ones.
586	The "escape" character (ESC, code 27), for example, was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning.
586	This is the same meaning of "escape" encountered in URL encodings, C language strings, and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning.
586	Over time this meaning has been co-opted and has eventually been changed.
586	In modern use, an ESC sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence, usually in the form of a so-called "ANSI escape code" (or, more properly, a "Control Sequence Introducer") beginning with ESC followed by a "[" (left-bracket) character.
586	An ESC sent from the terminal is most often used as an out-of-band character used to terminate an operation, as in the TECO and vi text editors.
586	In graphical user interface (GUI) and windowing systems, ESC generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to exit (terminate) altogether.
586	The inherent ambiguity of many control characters, combined with their historical usage, created problems when transferring "plain text" files between systems.
586	The best example of this is the newline problem on various operating systems.
586	Teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both "Carriage Return" (which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line) and "Line Feed" (which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead).
586	The name "Carriage Return" comes from the fact that on a manual typewriter the carriage holding the paper moved while the position where the keys struck the ribbon remained stationary.
586	The entire carriage had to be pushed (returned) to the right in order to position the left margin of the paper for the next line.
586	DEC operating systems (OS/8, RT-11, RSX-11, RSTS, TOPS-10, etc.) used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device (originally Teletype machines) would work.
586	By the time so-called "glass TTYs" (later called CRTs or terminals) came along, the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the convention.
586	Whetion was son Gary Kildall cloned RT-11 to create CP/M he followed established DEC convention.
586	Until the introduction of PC-DOS in 1981, IBM had no hand in this because their 1970s operating systems used EBCDIC instead of ASCII and they were oriented toward punch-card input and line printer output on which the concept of "carriage return" was meaningless.
586	IBM's PC-DOS (also marketed as MS-DOS by Microsoft) inherited the convention by virtue of being a clone of CP/M, and Windows inherited it from MS-DOS.
586	Unfortunately, requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each character when encountered alone.
586	To simplify matters plain text data streams, including files, on Multics used line feed (LF) alone as a line terminator.
586	Unix and Unix-like systems, and Amiga systems, adopted this convention from Multics.
586	The original Macintosh OS, Apple DOS, and ProDOS, on the other hand, used carriage return (CR) alone as a line terminator; however, since Apple replaced it with the Unix-based OS X operating system, they now use line feed (LF) as well.
586	Computers attached to the ARPANET included machines running operating systems such as TOPS-10 and TENEX using CR-LF line endings, machines running operating systems such as Multics using LF line endings, and machines running operating systems such as OS/360 that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and that used EBCDIC rather than ASCII.
586	The Telnet protocol defined an ASCII "Network Virtual Terminal" (NVT), so that connections between hosts with different line-ending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network; it used ASCII, along with CR-LF line endings, and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the NVT.
586	The File Transfer Protocol adopted the Telnet protocol, including use of the Network Virtual Terminal, for use when transmitting commands and transferring data in the default ASCII mode.
586	This adds complexity to implementations of those protocols, and to other network protocols, such as those used for E-mail and the World Wide Web, on systems not using the NVT's CR-LF line-ending convention.
586	Older operating systems such as TOPS-10, along with CP/M, tracked file length only in units of disk blocks and used Control-Z (SUB) to mark the end of the actual text in the file.
586	For this reason, EOF, or end-of-file, was used colloquially and conventionally as a three-letter acronym (TLA) for Control-Z instead of SUBstitute.
586	For a variety of reasons, the end-of-text code, ETX aka Control-C, was inappropriate and using Z as the control code to end a file is analogous to it ending the alphabet, a very convenient mnemonic aid.
586	An historic common, and still prevalent, convention uses the ETX aka Control-C code convention to interrupt and halt a program via an input data stream, usually from a keyboard.
586	In C library and Unix conventions, the null character is used to terminate text strings; such null-terminated strings can be known in abbreviation as ASCIZ or ASCIIZ, where here Z stands for "zero".
586	ASCII control code chart ASCII printable characters Codes 20hex to 7Ehex, known as the printable characters, represent letters, digits, punctuation marks, and a few miscellaneous symbols.
586	There are 95 printable characters in total.
586	Code 20hex, the space character, denotes the space between words, as produced by the space-bar of a keyboard.
586	Since the space character is considered an invisible graphic (rather than a control character) and thus would not normally be visible, it is represented here by Unicode character U+2420 "␠"; Unicode characters U+2422 "␢" and U+2423 "␣" are also available for use when a visible representation of a space is necessary.
586	Code 7Fhex corresponds to the non-printable "Delete" (DEL) control character and is therefore omitted from this chart; it is covered in the previous section's chart.
586	Earlier versions of ASCII used the up-arrow instead of the caret (5Ehex) and the left-arrow instead of the underscore (5Fhex).
586	Aliases A June 1992 RFC and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority registry of character sets recognize the following case-insensitive aliases for ASCII as suitable for use on the Internet: * ANSI_X3.4-1968 (canonical name) * iso-ir-6 * ANSI_X3.4-1986 * ISO_646.irv:1991 * ASCII (with ASCII-7 and ASCII-8 variants) * ISO646-US * US-ASCII (preferred MIME name) * us * IBM367 * cp367 * csASCII Of these, the IANA encourages use of the name "US-ASCII" for Internet uses of ASCII.
586	One often finds this in the optional "charset" parameter in the Content-Type header of some MIME messages, in the equivalent "meta" element of some HTML documents, and in the encoding declaration part of the prologue of some XML documents.
586	Variants As computer technology spread throughout the world, different standards bodies and corporations developed many variations of ASCII to facilitate the expression of non-English languages that used Roman-based alphabets.
586	One could class some of these variations as "ASCII extensions", although some misuse that term to represent all variants, including those that do not preserve ASCII's character-map in the 7-bit range.
586	The PETSCII code Commodore International used for their 8-bit systems is probably unique among post-1970 codes in being based on ASCII-1963, instead of the more common ASCII-1967, such as found on the ZX Spectrum computer.
586	Atari and Galaksija computers also used ASCII variants.
586	From early in its development, ASCII was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard, ultimately published as ISO/IEC 646 (1972), which would share most characters in common but assign other locally useful characters to several code points reserved for "national use."
586	However, the four years that elapsed between the publication of ASCII-1963 and ISO's first acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967 caused ASCII's choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world, causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points.
586	ISO/IEC 646, like ASCII, was a 7-bit character set.
586	It did not make any additional codes available, so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries.
586	Escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text, but they were rarely used, so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and therefore which character a code represented, and in general text-processing systems could cope with only one variant anyway.
586	Because the bracket and brace characters of ASCII were assigned to "national use" code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of ISO/IEC 646, a German, French, or Swedish, etc.
586	ISO/IEC 646, rather than ASCII, had to write, and thus read, something such as ä aÄiÜ='Ön'; ü instead of { a[i]='\n'; } C trigraphs were created to solve this problem for ANSI C, although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use.
586	Eventually, as 8-, 16-, and 32-bit computers began to replace 18- and 36-bit computers as the norm, it became common to use an 8-bit byte to store each character in memory, providing an opportunity for extended, 8-bit, relatives of ASCII.
586	In most cases these developed as true extensions of ASCII, leaving the original character-mapping intact, but adding additional character definitions after the first 128 (i.e., 7-bit) characters.
586	Most early home computer systems developed their own 8-bit character sets containing line-drawing and game glyphs, and often filled in some or all of the control characters from 0-31 with more graphics.
586	The IBM PC defined code page 437, which replaced the control-characters with graphic symbols such as smiley faces, and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions.
586	Operating systems such as DOS supported these code-pages, and manufacturers of IBM PCs supported them in hardware.
586	Digital Equipment Corporation developed the Multinational Character Set (DEC-MCS) for use in the popular VT220 terminal, this was one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics.
586	The Macintosh defined Mac OS Roman and Postscript also defined a set, both of these contained both international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics, more like modern character sets.
586	The ISO/IEC 8859 standard (derived from the DEC-MCS) finally provided a standard that most systems copied (at least as accurately as they copied ASCII, but with many substitutions).
586	A popular further extension designed by Microsoft, Windows-1252 (often mislabeled as ISO-8859-1), added the typographic punctuation marks needed for attractive text printing.
586	ISO-8859-1, Windows-1252, and the original 7-bit ASCII were the most common character encodings until the late 2000s, nowadays UTF-8 is becoming more common.
586	Unicode Unicode and the ISO/IEC 10646 Universal Character Set (UCS) have a much wider array of characters, and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant ISO/IEC 8859 and ASCII rapidly in many environments.
586	While ASCII is limited to 128 characters, Unicode and the UCS support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification (using natural numbers called code points) and encoding (to 8-, 16- or 32-bit binary formats, called UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32).
586	To allow backward compatibility, the 128 ASCII and 256 ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1) characters are assigned Unicode/UCS code points that are the same as their codes in the earlier standards.
586	Therefore, ASCII can be considered a 7-bit encoding scheme for a very small subset of Unicode/UCS, and ASCII (when prefixed with 0 as the eighth bit) is valid UTF-8.
586	Order ASCII-code order is also called ASCIIbetical order.
586	Collation of data is sometimes done in this order rather than "standard" alphabetical order (collating sequence).
586	The main deviations in ASCII order are: * All uppercase come before lowercase letters, for example, "Z" before "a" * Digits and many punctuation marks come before letters, for example, "4" precedes "one" * Numbers are sorted naïvely as strings, for example, "10" precedes "2" An intermediate order — readily implemented — converts uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ASCII values.
586	Naïve number sorting can be averted by zero-filling all numbers (e.g.
586	"02" will sort before "10" as expected), although this is an external fix and has nothing to do with the ordering itself.

593	The bouncing ball animation (below) consists of these six frames.
593	This animation moves at 10 frames per second.
593	Animation is the rapid display of a sequence of images to create an illusion of movement.
593	The most common method of presenting animation is as a motion picture or video program, although there are other methods.
593	This type of presentation is usually accomplished with a camera and a projector or a computer viewing screen which can rapidly cycle through images in a sequence.
593	Animation can be made with either hand rendered art, computer generated imagery, or three-dimensional objects, e.g.
593	The position of each object in any particular image relates to the position of that object in the previous and following images so that the objects each appear to fluidly move independently of one another.
593	The viewing device displays these images in rapid succession, usually 24, 25, or 30 frames per second.
593	Etymology  From Latin animātiō, "the act of bringing to life"; from animō ("to animate" or "give life to") + -ātiō ("the act of").
593	History  Early examples of attempts to capture the phenomenon of motion drawing can be found in paleolithic cave paintings, where animals are depicted with multiple legs in superimposed positions, clearly attempting to convey the perception of motion.
593	A 5,000 year old earthen bowl found in Iran in Shahr-i Sokhta has five images of a goat painted along the sides.
593	This has been claimed to be an example of early animation.
593	However, since no equipment existed to show the images in motion, such a series of images cannot be called animation in a true sense of the word.
593	A Chinese zoetrope-type device had been invented in 180 AD.
593	The phenakistoscope, praxinoscope, and the common flip book were early popular animation devices invented during the 19th century.
593	These devices produced the appearance of movement from sequential drawings using technological means, but animation did not really develop much further until the advent of cinematography.
593	The cinématographe was a projector,printer,and camera in one machine that allowed moving pictures to be shown successfully on a screen which was invented by history's earliest film makers Auguste and Louis Lumière in 1894.
593	There is no single person who can be considered the "creator" of film animation, as there were several people working on projects which could be considered animation at about the same time.
593	Georges Méliès was a creator of special-effect films; he was generally one of the first people to use animation with his technique.
593	He discovered a technique by accident which was to stop the camera rolling to change something in the scene, and then continue rolling the film.
593	This idea was later known as stop-motion animation.
593	Méliès discovered this technique accidentally when his camera broke down while shooting a bus driving by.
593	When he had fixed the camera, a hearse happened to be passing by just as Méliès restarted rolling the film, his end result was that he had managed to make a bus transform into a hearse.
593	This was just one of the great contributors to animation in the early years.
593	The earliest surviving stop-motion advertising film was an English short by Arthur Melbourne-Cooper called Matches: An Appeal (1899).
593	Developed for the Bryant and May Matchsticks company, it involved stop-motion animation of wired-together matches writing a patriotic call to action on a blackboard.
593	J.
593	Stuart Blackton was possibly the first American film-maker to use the techniques of stop-motion and hand-drawn animation.
593	Introduced to film-making by Edison, he pioneered these concepts at the turn of the 20th century, with his first copyrighted work dated 1900.
593	Several of his films, among them The Enchanted Drawing (1900) and Humorous Phases of Funny Faces (1906) were film versions of Blackton's "lightning artist" routine, and utilized modified versions of Méliès' early stop-motion techniques to make a series of blackboard drawings appear to move and reshape themselves.
593	Humorous Phases of Funny Faces' is regularly cited as the first true animated film, and Blackton is considered the first true animator.
593	Another French artist, Émile Cohl, began drawing cartoon strips and created a film in 1908 called Fantasmagorie.
593	The film largely consisted of a stick figure moving about and encountering all manner of morphing objects, such as a wine bottle that transforms into a flower.
593	There were also sections of live action where the animator’s hands would enter the scene.
593	The film was created by drawing each frame on paper and then shooting each frame onto negative film, which gave the picture a blackboard look.
593	This makes Fantasmagorie the first animated film created using what came to be known as traditional (hand-drawn) animation.
593	The author of the first puppet-animated film (i.e.
593	The Beautiful Lukanida (1912)) was the Russian-born (ethnically Polish) director Wladyslaw Starewicz, known as Ladislas Starevich.
593	Following the successes of Blackton and Cohl, many other artists began experimenting with animation.
593	One such artist was Winsor McCay, a successful newspaper cartoonist, who created detailed animations that required a team of artists and painstaking attention for detail.
593	Each frame was drawn on paper; which invariably required backgrounds and characters to be redrawn and animated.
593	Among McCay'paper; which invariably res most noted films are Little Nemo (1911), Gertie the Dinosaur (1914) and The Sinking of the Lusitania (1918).
593	The production of animated short films, typically referred to as "cartoons", became an industry of its own during the 1910s, and cartoon shorts were produced to be shown in movie theaters.
593	The most successful early animation producer was John Randolph Bray, who, along with animator Earl Hurd, patented the cel animation process which dominated the animation industry for the rest of the decade.
593	El Apóstol (Spanish: "The Apostle") was a 1917 Argentine animated film utilizing cutout animation, and the world's first animated feature film.
593	Unfortunately, a fire that destroyed producer Frederico Valle's film studio incinerated the only known copy of El Apóstol, and it is now considered a lost film.
593	Computer animation has become popular since Toy Story (1995), the first animated film completely made using this technique.
593	In 2008, the animation market was worth US$68.4 billion.
593	Techniques  Traditional animation  Traditional animation (also called cel animation or hand-drawn animation) was the process used for most animated films of the 20th century.
593	The individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings, which are first drawn on paper.
593	To create the illusion of movement, each drawing differs slightly from the one before it.
593	The animators' drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called cels, which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings.
593	The completed character cels are photographed one-by-one onto motion picture film against a painted background by a rostrum camera.
593	The traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the 21st century.
593	Today, animators' drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system.
593	Various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects.
593	The final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media, including traditional 35 mm film and newer media such as digital video.
593	The "look" of traditional cel animation is still preserved, and the character animators' work has remained essentially the same over the past 70 years.
593	Some animation producers have used the term "tradigital" to describe cel animation which makes extensive use of computer technology.
593	Examples of traditionally animated feature films include Pinocchio (United States, 1940), Animal Farm (United Kingdom, 1954), and Akira (Japan, 1988).
593	Traditional animated films which were produced with the aid of computer technology include The Lion King (US, 1994) Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi (Spirited Away) (Japan, 2001), and Les Triplettes de Belleville (France, 2003).
593	Full animation refers to the process of producing high-quality traditionally animated films, which regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement.
593	Fully animated films can be done in a variety of styles, from more realistically animated works such as those produced by the Walt Disney studio (Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Lion King) to the more 'cartoony' styles of those produced by the Warner Bros.
593	Many of the Disney animated features are examples of full animation, as are non-Disney works such as The Secret of NIMH (US, 1982), The Iron Giant (US, 1999), and Nocturna (Spain, 2007).
593	Limited animation involves the use of less detailed and/or more stylized drawings and methods of movement.
593	Pioneered by the artists at the American studio United Productions of America, limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression, as in Gerald McBoing Boing (US, 1951), Yellow Submarine (UK, 1968), and much of the anime produced in Japan.
593	Its primary use, however, has been in producing cost-effective animated content for media such as television (the work of Hanna-Barbera, Filmation, and other TV animation studios) and later the Internet (web cartoons).
593	Rotoscoping is a technique, patented by Max Fleischer in 1917, where animators trace live-action movement, frame by frame.
593	The source film can be directly copied from actors' outlines into animated drawings, as in The Lord of the Rings (US, 1978), or used in a stylized and expressive manner, as in Waking Life (US, 2001) and A Scanner Darkly (US, 2006).
593	Some other examples are: Fire and Ice (USA, 1983) and Heavy Metal (1981).
593	Live-action/animation is a technique, when combining hand-drawn characters into live action shots.
593	One of the earlier uses of it was Koko the Clown when Koko was drawn over live action footage.
593	Other examples would include Who Framed Roger Rabbit (USA, 1988), Space Jam (USA, 1996) and Osmosis Jones (USA, 2001).
593	Stop motion  Stop-motion animation is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real-world objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement.
593	There are many different types of stop-motion animation, usually named after the medium used to create the animation.
593	Computer software is widely available to create this type of animation.
593	Puppet animation typically involves stop-motion puppet figures interacting with each other in a constructed environment, in contrast to the real-world interaction in model animation.
593	The puppets generally have an armature inside of them to keep them still and steady as well as constraining them to move at particular joints.
593	Examples include The Tale of the Fox (France, 1937), The Nightmare Before Christmas (US, 1993), Corpse Bride (US, 2005), Coraline (US, 2009), the films of Jiří Trnka and the TV series Robot Chicken (US, 2005–present).
593	Puppetoon, created using techniques developed by George Pal, are puppet-animated films which typically use a different version of a puppet for different frames, rather than simply manipulating one existing puppet.
593	Clay animation, or Plasticine animation (often called claymation, which, however, is a trademarked name), uses figures made of clay or a similar malleable material to create stop-motion animation.
593	The figures may have an armature or wire frame inside of them, similar to the related puppet animation (below), that can be manipulated to pose the figures.
593	Alternatively, the figures may be made entirely of clay, such as in the films of Bruce Bickford, where clay creatures morph into a variety of different shapes.
593	Examples of clay-animated wckford, whereorks include The Gumby Show (US, 1957–1967) Morph shorts (UK, 1977–2000), Wallace and Gromit shorts (UK, as of 1989), Jan Švankmajer's Dimensions of Dialogue (Czechoslovakia, 1982), The Trap Door (UK, 1984).
593	Films include Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, Chicken Run and The Adventures of Mark Twain.
593	Cutout animation is a type of stop-motion animation produced by moving 2-dimensional pieces of material such as paper or cloth.
593	Examples include Terry Gilliam's animated sequences from Monty Python's Flying Circus (UK, 1969–1974); Fantastic Planet (France/Czechoslovakia, 1973) ; Tale of Tales (Russia, 1979), The pilot episode of the TV series (and sometimes in episodes) of South Park (US, 1997).
593	Silhouette animation is a variant of cutout animation in which the characters are backlit and only visible as silhouettes.
593	Examples include The Adventures of Prince Achmed (Weimar Republic, 1926) and Princes et princesses (France, 2000).
593	Model animation refers to stop-motion animation created to interact with and exist as a part of a live-action world.
593	Intercutting, matte effects, and split screens are often employed to blend stop-motion characters or objects with live actors and settings.
593	Examples include the work of Ray Harryhausen, as seen in films such Jason and the Argonauts (1963), and the work of Willis O'Brien on films such as King Kong (1933 film).
593	Go motion is a variant of model animation which uses various techniques to create motion blur between frames of film, which is not present in traditional stop-motion.
593	The technique was invented by Industrial Light & Magic and Phil Tippett to create special effects scenes for the film The Empire Strikes Back (1980).
593	Another example is the dragon named Vermithrax from Dragonslayer (1981 film).
593	Object animation refers to the use of regular inanimate objects in stop-motion animation, as opposed to specially created items.
593	Graphic animation uses non-drawn flat visual graphic material (photographs, newspaper clippings, magazines, etc.) which are sometimes manipulated frame-by-frame to create movement.
593	At other times, the graphics remain stationary, while the stop-motion camera is moved to create on-screen action.
593	Brickfilm A sub genre of object animation involving using Lego or other similar brick toys to make an animation.
593	These have had a recent boost in popularity with the advent of video sharing sites like YouTube, and the availability of cheap cameras, and animation software.
593	Pixilation involves the use of live humans as stop motion characters.
593	This allows for a number of surreal effects, including disappearances and reappearances, allowing people to appear to slide across the ground, and other such effects.
593	Examples of pixilation include The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb and Angry Kid shorts.
593	Computer animation  Computer animation encompasses a variety of techniques, the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on a computer.
593	This animation takes less time than previous traditional animation.
593	D animation  2D animation figures are created and/or edited on the computer using 2D bitmap graphics or created and edited using 2D vector graphics.
593	This includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques such as of, interpolated morphing, onion skinning and interpolated rotoscoping.
593	D animation has many applications, including analog computer animation, Flash animation and PowerPoint animation.
593	Cinemagraphs are still photographs in the form of an animated GIF file of which part is animated.
593	D animation  3D animation is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator.
593	The animator starts by creating an external 3D mesh to manipulate.
593	A mesh is a geometric configuration that gives the visual appearance of form to a 3D object or 3D environment.
593	The mesh may have many vertices which are the geometric points which make up the mesh; it is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an armature that can be used to control the mesh with weights.
593	This process is called rigging and can be programmed with movement with keyframes.
593	Other techniques can be applied, such as mathematical functions (ex.
593	These techniques fall under the category of 3D dynamics.
593	Terms  * Cel-shaded animation is used to mimic traditional animation using CG software.
593	Shading looks stark, with less blending colors.
593	Examples include, Skyland (2007, France), Appleseed Ex Machina (2007, Japan), The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker (2002, Japan) * Machinima – Films created by screen capturing in video games and virtual worlds.
593	Motion capture is used when live-action actors wear special suits that allow computers to copy their movements into CG characters.
593	Examples include Polar Express (2004, USA), Beowulf (2007, USA), A Christmas Carol (2009, USA), The Adventures of Tintin (2011, USA) * Photo-realistic animation is used primarily for animation that attempts to resemble real life, using advanced rendering that makes detailed skin, plants, water, fire, clouds, etc.
593	Examples include Up (2009, USA), Kung-Fu Panda (2008, USA), Ice Age (2002, USA).
593	D animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while 3D techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact.
593	D animation can create images that seem real to the viewer.
593	Other animation techniques  * Final line advection animation, a technique that gives the artists and animators a lot more influence and control over the final product as everything is done within the same department; "In Paperman, we didn’t have a cloth department and we didn’t have a hair department.
593	Here, folds in the fabric, hair silhouettes and the like come from of the commited design decision-making that comes with the 2D drawn process.
593	Our animators can change things, actually erase away the CG underlayer if they want, and change the profile of the arm.
593	And they can design all the fabric in that Milt Kahl kind-of way, if they want to."
593	Drawn on film animation: a technique where footage is produced by creating the images directly on film stock, for example by Norman McLaren, Len Lye and Stan Brakhage.
593	Paint-on-glass animation: a technique for making animated films by manipulating slow drying oil paints on sheets of glass, for example by Aleksandr Petrov.
593	Erasure animation: a technique using tradition 2D medium, photographed over time as the artist manipulates the image.
593	For example, William Kentridge is famous for his charcoal erasure films, and s the image.
593	For example, WiPiotr Dumała for his auteur technique of animating scratches on plaster.
593	Pinscreen animation: makes use of a screen filled with movable pins, which can be moved in or out by pressing an object onto the screen.
593	The screen is lit from the side so that the pins cast shadows.
593	The technique has been used to create animated films with a range of textural effects difficult to achieve with traditional cel animation.
593	Sand animation: sand is moved around on a back- or front-lighted piece of glass to create each frame for an animated film.
593	This creates an interesting effect when animated because of the light contrast.
593	Flip book: a flip book (sometimes, especially in British English, called a flick book) is a book with a series of pictures that vary gradually from one page to the next, so that when the pages are turned rapidly, the pictures appear to animate by simulating motion or some other change.
593	Flip books are often illustrated books for children, but may also be geared towards adults and employ a series of photographs rather than drawings.
593	Flip books are not always separate books, but may appear as an added feature in ordinary books or magazines, often in the page corners.
593	Software packages and websites are also available that convert digital video files into custom-made flip books.
593	Zoetrope: a device that produces the illusion of motion from a rapid succession of static pictures.
593	The term zoetrope is from the Greek words ζωή (zoē), meaning "alive, active", and τροπή (tropē), meaning "turn", with "zoetrope" taken to mean "active turn" or "wheel of life".
593	Other styles, techniques and approaches  * Animatronics & Audio-Animatronics * Animutation - a style of animation invented by Neil Cicierega at age 13.
593	This style of animation is usually characterized by random images of pop culture in sequence with foreign music.
593	The animation style is strange, weird, random, but from a creator's point of view, very easy to implement.
593	Professionalism is not required in the Animutation style.
593	Character animation * Chuckimation * Puppetry * Multi-sketching * Special effects animation * Stop motion Awards As with any other form of media, animation too has instituted awards for excellence in the field.
593	The original awards for animation were given out by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for animated shorts from the year 1932, during the 5th Academy Awards function.
593	The first winner of the Academy Award was the short Flowers and Trees, a production by Walt Disney Productions and United Artists.
593	However, the Academy Award for a feature length animated motion picture was only instituted for the year 2001, and awarded during the 74th Academy Awards in 2002.
593	It was won by the movie Shrek, produced by DreamWorks and Pacific Data Images.
593	Since then, Disney/Pixar have produced the most number of movies either to win or be nominated for the award.
593	The list of both awards can be obtained here: *Academy Award for Best Animated Feature *Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film Several other countries have instituted an award for best animated feature film as part of their national film awards: BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film (since 2006), César Award for Best Animated Film (since 2011), Goya Award for Best Animated Film (since 1989), Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year (since 2007).
593	Also since 2007, the Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Animated Feature Film has been awarded at the Asia Pacific Screen Awards.
593	Since 2009, the European Film Awards have awarded the European Film Award for Best Animated Film.
593	The Annie Award is another award given out for excellence in the field of animation.
593	Unlike the Academy Awards, the Annie Awards are only received due to achievements in the field of animation and not for any other field of technical and artistic endeavor.
593	They were re-organized in 1992, to create a new field for Best Animated feature.
593	The 1990s were dominated by Walt Disney, however newer studios, led by Pixar, have now begun to consistently vie for this award.
593	The list of awardees is as follows:  *Annie Award for Best Animated Feature
594	Apollo (Attic, Ionic, and Homeric Greek: , Apollōn (gen.: ); Doric: , Apellōn; Arcadocypriot: , Apeilōn; Aeolic: , Aploun; ) is one of the most important and complex of the Olympian deities in ancient Greek and Roman religion, Greek and Roman mythology, and Greco–Roman Neopaganism.
594	The ideal of the kouros (a beardless, athletic youth), Apollo has been variously recognized as a god of light and the sun, truth and prophecy, healing, plague, music, poetry, and more.
594	Apollo is the son of Zeus and Leto, and has a twin sister, the chaste huntress Artemis.
594	Apollo is known in Greek-influenced Etruscan mythology as Apulu.
594	As the patron of Delphi (Pythian Apollo), Apollo was an oracular god—the prophetic deity of the Delphic Oracle.
594	Medicine and healing are associated with Apollo, whether through the god himself or mediated through his son Asclepius, yet Apollo was also seen as a god who could bring ill-health and deadly plague.
594	Amongst the god's custodial charges, Apollo became associated with dominion over colonists, and as the patron defender of herds and flocks.
594	As the leader of the Muses (Apollon Musegetes) and director of their choir, Apollo functioned as the patron god of music and poetry.
594	Hermes created the lyre for him, and the instrument became a common attribute of Apollo.
594	Hymns sung to Apollo were called paeans.
594	In Hellenistic times, especially during the 3rd century BCE, as Apollo Helios he became identified among Greeks with Helios, Titan god of the sun, and his sister Artemis similarly equated with Selene, Titan goddess of the moon.
594	In Latin texts, on the other hand, Joseph Fontenrose declared himself unable to find any conflation of Apollo with Sol among the Augustan poets of the 1st century, not even in the conjurations of Aeneas and Latinus in Aeneid XII (161–215).
594	Apollo and Helios/Sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the 3rd century CE.
594	Etymology The etymology of Apollo is uncertain.
594	The spelling Ἀπόλλων had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era, but the Doric form Απέλλων is more archaic, derived from an earlier *Απέλjων.
594	The name is certainly cognate with the Doric month name Απέλλαιος and the Doric festival απελλαι.
594	Several instances of popular etymology are attested from ancient authors.
594	Thus, the Greeks most often associated Apollo's name with the Greek verb ἀπόλλυμι (apollymi), "to destroy".
594	Plato in Cratylus connects the name with  (apolysis), "redeem", with  (apolousis), "purification", and with  ([h]aploun), "simple", in particular in reference to the Thessalian form of the name, , and finally with  (aeiballon), "ever-shooting".
594	Hesychius connects the name Apollo with the Doric απέλλα (apella), which means "assembly", so that Apollo would be the god of political life, and he also gives the explanation σηκός (sekos), "fold", in which case Apollo would be the god of flocks and herds.
594	Following the tradition of these Ancient Greek folk etymologies, in the Doric dialect the word  originally meant wall, fence from animals and later assembly within the agora.
594	In the Ancient Macedonian language  (pella) means stone, and some toponyms are derived from this word:  (Pelα}} (pella) means stone, and some toponyms are derived from this word:  ([la:capital of Ancient Macedonia),  (Pellini-Pallini).
594	A number of non-Greek etymologies have been suggested for the name, The form Apaliunas (d) is attested as a god of Wilusa in a treaty between Alaksandu of Wilusa and the Hittite great king Muwatalli II c.
594	BCE.
594	Alaksandu could be Paris-Alexander of Ilion", whose name is Greek.
594	The Hittite testimony reflects an early form ', which may also be surmised from comparison of Cypriot Απειλων with Doric Απελλων.
594	A Luwian etymology suggested for Apaliunas makes Apollo "The One of Entrapment", perhaps in the sense of "Hunter".
594	Among the proposed etymologies is the Hurrian and Hittite divinity, Aplu, who was widely invoked during the "plague years".
594	Aplu, it is suggested, comes from the Akkadian Aplu Enlil, meaning "the son of Enlil", a title that was given to the god Nergal, who was linked to Shamash, Babylonian god of the sun.
594	Greco-Roman epithets Apollo, like other Greek deities, had a number of epithets applied to him, reflecting the variety of roles, duties, and aspects ascribed to the god.
594	However, while Apollo has a great number of appellations in Greek myth, only a few occur in Latin literature, chief among them Phoebus ( ; Φοίβος, Phoibos, literally "radiant"), which was very commonly used by both the Greeks and Romans in Apollo's role as the god of light.
594	As sun-god and god of light, Apollo was also known by the epithets Aegletes ( ; Αἰγλήτης, Aiglētēs, from αἴγλη, "light of the sun"), Helius ( ; Ἥλιος, Helios, literally "sun"), Phanaeus ( ; Φαναῖος, Phanaios, literally "giving or bringing light"), and Lyceus ( ; Λύκειος, Lukeios, from Proto-Greek *λύκη, "light").
594	The meaning of the epithet "Lyceus" later became associated Apollo's mother Leto, who was the patron goddess of Lycia (Λυκία) and who was identified with the wolf (λύκος), earning him the epithets Lycegenes ( ; Λυκηγενής, Lukēgenēs, literally "born of a wolf" or "born of Lycia") and Lycoctonus ( ; Λυκοκτόνος, Lukoktonos, from λύκος, "wolf", and κτείνειν, "to kill").
594	As god of the sun, the Romans referred to Apollo as Sol ( ; literally "sun" in Latin).
594	In association with his birthplace, Mount Cynthus on the island of Delos, Apollo was called Cynthius ( ; Κύνθιος, Kunthios, literally "Cynthian"), Cynthogenes ( ; Κύνθογενης, Kunthogenēs, literally "born of Cynthus"), and Delius ( ; Δήλιος, Delios, literally "Delian").
594	As Artemis's twin, Apollo had the epithet Didymaeus ( ; Διδυμαιος, Didumaios, from δίδυμος, "twin").
594	Apollo was worshipped as Actiacus ( ; Ἄκτιακός, Aktiakos, literally "Actian"), Delphinius ( ; Δελφίνιος, Delphinios, literally "Delphic"), and Pythius ( ; Πύθιος, Puthios, from Πυθώ, Pūthō, the area around Delphi), after Actium (Ἄκτιον) and Delphi (Δελφοί) respectively, two of his principal places of worship.
594	An etiology in the Homeric hymns associated the epithet "Delphinius" with dolphins.
594	He was worshipped as Acraephius ( ; Ἀκραιφιος, Akraiphios, literally "Acraephian") or Acraephiaeus ( ; Ἀκραιφιαίος, Akraiphiaios, literally "Acraephian") in the Boeotian town of Acraephia (Ἀκραιφία), reputedly founded by his son Acraepheus; and as Smintheus ( ; Σμινθεύς, Smintheus, "Sminthian"—that is, "of the town of Sminthos or Sminthe") near the Troad town of Hamaxitus.
594	The epithet "Smintheus" has historically been confused with σμίνθος, "mouse", in association with Apollo's role as a god of disease.
594	For this he was also known as Parnopius ( ; Παρνόπιος, Parnopios, from πάρνοψ, "locust") and to the Romans as Culicarius ( ; from Latin culicārius, "of midges").
594	In Apollo's role as a healer, his appellations included Acesius ( ; Ἀκέσιος, Akesios, from ἄκεσις, "healing"), Acestor ( ; Ἀκέστωρ, Akestōr, literally "healer"), Paean ( ; Παιάν, Paiān, from παίειν, "to touch"), and Iatrus ( ; Ἰατρός, Iātros, literally "physician").
594	Acesius was the epithet of Apollo worshipped in Elis, where he had a temple in the agora.
594	The Romans referred to Apollo as Medicus ( ; literally "physician" in Latin) in this respect.
594	A temple was dedicated to Apollo Medicus at Rome, probably next to the temple of Bellona.
594	As a protector and founder, Apollo had the epithets Alexicacus ( ; Ἀλεξίκακος, Alexikakos, literally "warding off evil"), Apotropaeus ( ; Ἀποτρόπαιος, Apotropaios, from ἀποτρέπειν, "to avert"), and Epicurius ( ; Ἐπικούριος, Epikourios, from ἐπικουρέειν, "to aid"), and Archegetes ( ; Ἀρχηγέτης, Arkhēgetēs, literally "founder"), Clarius ( ; Κλάριος, Klārios, from Doric κλάρος, "allotted lot"), and Genetor ( ; Γενέτωρ, Genetōr, literally "ancestor").
594	To the Romans, he was known in this capacity as Averruncus ( ; from Latin āverruncare, "to avert").
594	He was also called Agyieus ( ; Ἀγυιεύς, Aguīeus, from ἄγυια, "street") for his role in protecting roads and homes; and as Nomius ( ; Νόμιος, Nomios, literally "pastoral") and Nymphegetes ( ; Νυμφηγέτης, Numphēgetēs, from Νύμφη, "Nymph", and ἡγέτης, "leader") in his role as a protector of shepherds and pastoral life.
594	In his role as god of prophecy and truth, Apollo had the epithets Manticus ( ; Μαντικός, Mantikos, literally "prophetic"), Leschenorius ( ; Λεσχηνόριος, Leskhēnorios, from λεσχήνωρ, "converser"), and Loxias ( ; Λοξίας, Loxias, from λέγειν, "to say").
594	The epithet "Loxias" has historically been associated with λοξός, "ambiguous".
594	In this respect, the Romans called him Coelispex ( ; from Latin coelum, "sky", and specere, "to look at").
594	The epithet Iatromantis ( ; Ἰατρομάντις, Iātromantis, from ὶατρός, "physician", and μάντις, "prophet") refers to both his role as a god of healing and of prophecy.
594	As god of music and arts, Apollo had the epithet Musagetes ( ; Doric Μουσαγέτας, Mousāgetās) or Musegetes ( ; Μουσηγέτης, Mousēgetēs, from Μούσα, "Muse", and ἡγέτης, "leader").
594	As a god of archery, Apollo was known as Aphetor ( ; Ἀφήτωρ, Aphētōr, from ὰφίημι, "to let loose") or Aphetorus ( ; Ἀφητόρος, Aphētoros, of the same origin), Argyrotoxus ( ; Ἀργυρότοξος, Argurotoxos, literally "with silver bow"), Hecaërgus ( ; Ἑκάεργος, Hekaergos, literally "far-shooting"), and Hecebolus ( ; Ἑκηβόλος, Hekēbolos, literally "far-shooting").
594	The Romans referred to Apollo as Articenens ( ; "bow-carrying").
594	Apollo was called Ismenius ( ; Ἰσμηνιός, Ismēnios, literally "of Ismenus") after Ismenus, the son of Amphion and Niobe, whom he struck with an arrow.
594	Celtic epithets and cult titles Apollo was worshipped throughout the Roman Empire.
594	In the traditionally Celtic lands he was most often seen as a healing and sun god.
594	He was often equated with Celtic gods of similar character.
594	Apollo Atepomarus ("the great horseman" or "possessing a great horse").
594	Apollo was worshipped at Mauvières (Indre).
594	Horses were, in the Celtic world, closely linked to the sun.
594	Apollo Belenus ('bright' or 'brilliant').
594	This epithet was given to Apollo in parts of Gaul, Northern Italy and Noricum (part of modern Austria).
594	Apollo Belenus was a healing and sun god.
594	Apollo Cunomaglus ('hound lord').
594	A title given to Apollo at a shrine in Wiltshire.
594	Apollo Cunomaglus may have been a god of healing.
594	Cunomaglus himself may originally have been an independent healing god.
594	Apollo Grannus.
594	Grannus was a healing spring god, later equated with Apollo.
594	Apollo Maponus.
594	A god known from inscriptions in Britain.
594	This may be a local fusion of Apollo and Maponus.
594	Apollo Moritasgus ('masses of sea water').
594	An epithet for Apollo at Alesia, where he was worshipped as god of healing and, possibly, of physicians.
594	Apollo Vindonnus ('clear light').
594	Apollo Vindonnus had a temple at Essarois, near Châtillon-sur-Seine in Burgundy.
594	He was a god of healing, especially of the eyes.
594	Apollo Virotutis ('benefactor of mankind?').
594	Apollo Virotutis was worshipped, among other places, at Fins d'Annecy (Haute-Savoie) and at Jublains (Maine-et-Loire).
594	Origins The cult centers of Apollo in Greece, Delphi and Delos, date from the 8th century BCE.
594	The Delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to Artemis, Apollo's twin sister.
594	At Delphi, Apollo was venerated as the slayer of Pytho.
594	For the Greeks, Apollo was all the Gods in one and through the centuries he acquired different functions which could originate from different gods.
594	In archaic Greece he was the prophet, the oracular god who in older times was connected with "healing".
594	In classical Greece he was the god of light and of music, but in popular religion he had a strong function to keep away evil.
594	Walter Burkert discerned three components in the prehistory of Apollo worship, which he termed "a Dorian-northwest Greek component, a Cretan-Minoan component, and a Syro-Hittite component."
594	From his eastern-origin Apollo brought the art of inspection from "symbols and omina" (σημεία και τέρατα : semeia kai terata), and of the observation of the omens of the days.
594	The inspiration oracular-cult was probably introduced from Anatolia.
594	The ritualism belonged to Apollo from the beginning.
594	The Greeks created the legalism, the supervision of the orders of the gods, and the demand for moderation and harmony.
594	Apollo became the god of shining youth, the protector of music, spiritual-life, moderation and perceptible order.
594	The improvement of the old Anatolian god, and his elevation to an intellectual sphere, may be considered an achievement of the Greek people.
594	Healer and god-protector from evil The function of Apollo as a "healer" is connected with Paean (Παιών-Παιήων), the physician of the Gods in the Iliad, who seems to come from a more primitive religion.
594	Paeοn is probably connected with the Mycenean Pa-ja-wo, but the etymology is the only evidence.
594	He did not have a separate cult, but he was the personification of the holy magic-song sung by the magicians that was supposed to cure disease.
594	Later the Greeks knew the original meaning of the relevant song "paean" (παιάν).
594	The magicians were also called "seer-doctors" (ιατρομάντεις), and they used an ecstatic prophetic art which was used exactly by the god Apollo at the oracles.
594	In the Iliad, Apollo is the healer under the gods, but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows, similar to the function of the terrible Vedic god of disease Rudra.
594	He sends a terrible plague (λοιμός) to the Achaeans.
594	The god who sends a disease can also prevent from it, therefore when it stops they make a purifying ceremony and offer him an "hecatomb" to ward off evil.
594	When the oath of his priest appeases, they pray and with a song they call their own god, the beautiful Paean.
594	Some common epithets of Apollo as a healer are "paion" (παιών:touching), "epikourios" (επικουρώ:help), "oulios" (ουλή:cured wound), and "loimios" (λοiμός:plague).
594	In classical times, his strong function in popular religion was to keep away evil, and was therefore called "apotropaios" (αποτρέπω:to divert) and "alexikakos" (αλέξω-κακό:defend, throw away the evil).
594	In later writers, the word, usually spelled "Paean", becomes a mere epithet of Apollo in his capacity as a god of healing.
594	Homer illustrated Paeon the god, and the song both of apotropaic thanksgiving or triumph.
594	Such songs were originally addressed to Apollo, and afterwards to other gods: to Dionysus, to Apollo Helios, to Apollo's son Asclepius the healer.
594	About the 4th century BCE, the paean became merely a formula of adulation; its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune, or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered.
594	It was in this way that Apollo had become recognised as the god of music.
594	Apollo's role as the slayer of the Python led to his association with battle and victory; hence it became the Roman custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle, when a fleet left the harbour, and also after a victory had been won.
594	Dorian origin The connection with Dorians and their initiation festival apellai is reinforced by the month Apellaios in northwest Greek calendars, but it can explain only the Doric type of the name, which is connected with the Ancient Macedonian word "pella" (Pella), stone.
594	Stones played an important part in the  Macedonian word "pella&quotcult of the god, especially in the oracular shrine of Delphi (Omphalos).
594	The "Homeric hymn" represents Apollo as a Northern intruder.
594	His arrival must have occurred during the "dark ages" that followed the destruction of the Mycenaean civilization, and his conflict with Gaia (Mother Earth) was represented by the legend of his slaying her daughter the serpent Python.
594	The earth deity had power over the ghostly world, and it is believed that she was the deity behind the oracle.
594	The older tales mentioned two dragons who were perhaps intentionally conflated.
594	A female dragon named Delphyne (δελφύς:womb), who is obviously connected with Delphi and Apollo Delphinios, and a male serpent Typhon (τύφειν:smoke), the adversary of Zeus in the Titanomachy, who the narrators confused with Python.
594	Python was the good daemon (αγαθός δαίμων) of the temple as it appears in Minoan religion, but she was represented as a dragon, as often happens in Northern European folklore as well as in the East.
594	Apollo and his sister Artemis can bring death with their arrows.
594	The conception that diseases and death come from invisible shots sent by supernatural beings, or magicians is common in Germanic and Norse mythology.
594	In Greek mythology Artemis was the leader ( ηγεμόνη : hegemone) of the nymphs, who had similar functions with the Nordic Elves.
594	The "elf-shot" originally indicated disease or death attributed to the elves, but it was later attested denoting arrow-heads which were used by witches to harm people, and also for healing rituals.
594	The Vedic Rudra has some similar functions with Apollo.
594	The terrible god is called "The Archer", and the bow is also an attribute of Shiva.
594	Rudra could bring diseases with his arrows, but he was able to free people of them, and his alternative Shiba, is a healer physician god.
594	However the Indo-European component of Apollo, does not explain his strong relation with omens, exorcisms, and with the oracular cult.
594	Minoan origin It seems an oracular cult existed in Delphi from the Mycenaean ages.
594	In historical times, the priests of Delphi were called Labryaden, "the double-axe men", which indicates Minoan origin.
594	The double-axe (λάβρυς:labrys) was the holy symbol of the Cretan labyrinth.
594	The Homeric hymn adds that Apollo appeared as a dolphin and carried Cretan priests to Delphi, where they evidently transferred their religious practices.
594	Apollo Delphinios was a sea-god especially worshiped in Crete and in the islands, and his name indicates his connection with Delphi and the holy serpent Delphyne (womb).
594	Apollo's sister Artemis, who was the Greek goddess of hunting, is identified with Britomartis (Diktynna), the Minoan "Mistress of the animals".
594	In her earliest depictions she is accompanied by the "Mister of the animals", a male god of hunting who had the bow as his attribute.
594	We don't know his original name, but it seems that he was absorbed by the more powerful Apollo, who stood by the "Mistress of the animals", becoming her brother.
594	The old oracles in Delphi seem to be connected with a local tradition of the priesthood, and there is not clear evidence that a kind of inspiration-prophecy existed in the temple.
594	This led some scholars to the conclusion that Pythia carried on the rituals in a consistent procedure through many centuries, according to the local tradition.
594	In that regard, the mythical seeress Sibyl of Anatolian origin, with her ecstatic art, looks unrelated to the oracle itself.
594	However, the Greek tradition is referring to the existence of vapours and chewing of laurel-leaves, which seem to be confirmed by recent studies.
594	Plato describes the priestesses of Delphi and Dodona as frenzied women, obsessed by "mania" (μανία:frenzy), a Greek word connected with "mantis" (μάντις:prophet).
594	Frenzied women like Sibyls from whose lips the god speaks are recorded in the Near East as Mari in the second millennium BC.
594	Although Crete had contacts with Mari from 2000 BC, there is no evidence that the ecstatic prophetic art existed during the Minoan and Mycenean ages.
594	It is more probable that this art was introduced later from Anatolia and regenerated an existing oracular cult that was local to Delphi and dormant in several areas of Greece.
594	Anatolian origin A non-Greek origin of Apollo has long been assumed in scholarship.
594	The name of Apollo's mother Leto has Lydian origin, and she was worshipped on the coasts of Asia Minor.
594	The inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into Greece from Anatolia, which is the origin of Sibyl, and where existed some of the oldest oraculare from Anatolia, which is the origin of Sibyl, and where exis shrines.
594	Omens, symbols, purifications, and exorcisms appear in old Assyro-Babylonian texts, and these rituals were spread into the empire of the Hittites.
594	In a Hittite text is mentioned that the king invited a Babylonian priestess for a certain "purification".
594	A similar story is mentioned by Plutarch.
594	He writes that the Cretan- seer Epimenides, purified Athens after the pollution brought by the Alcmeonidae, and that the seer's expertise in sacrifices and reform of funeral practices were of great help to Solon in his reform of the Athenian state.
594	The story indicates that Epimenides was probably heir to the shamanic religions of Asia, and proves together with the Homeric hymn, that Crete had a resisting religion up to the historical times.
594	It seems that these rituals were dormant in Greece, and they were reinforced when the Greeks migrated to Anatolia.
594	Homer pictures Apollo on the side of the Trojans, fighting against the Achaeans, during the Trojan War.
594	He is pictured as a terrible god, less trusted by the Greeks than other gods.
594	The god seems to be related to Appaliunas, a tutelary god of Wilusa (Troy) in Asia Minor, but the word is not complete.
594	The stones found in front of the gates of Homeric Troy were the symbols of Apollo.
594	The Greeks gave to him the name αγυιεύς agyieus as the protector god of public places and houses who wards off evil, and his symbol was a tapered stone or column.
594	However, while usually Greek festivals were celebrated at the full moon, all the feasts of Apollo were celebrated at the seventh day of the month, and the emphasis given to that day (sibutu) indicates a Babylonian origin.
594	The Late Bronze Age (from 1700 to 1200 BCE) Hittite and Hurrian Aplu was a god of plague, invoked during plague years.
594	Here we have an apotropaic situation, where a god originally bringing the plague was invoked to end it.
594	Aplu, meaning the son of, was a title given to the god Nergal, who was linked to the Babylonian god of the sun Shamash.
594	Homer interprets Apollo as a terrible god (δεινός θεός) who brings death and disease with his arrows, but who can also heal, possessing a magic art that separates him from the other Greek gods.
594	In Iliad, his priest prays to Apollo Smintheus, the mouse god who retains an older agricultural function as the protector from field rats.
594	All these functions, including the function of the healer-god Paean, who seems to have Mycenean origin, are fused in the cult of Apollo.
594	Oracular cult Unusually among the Olympic deities, Apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence: Delos and Delphi.
594	In cult practice, Delian Apollo and Pythian Apollo (the Apollo of Delphi) were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality.
594	Apollo's cult was already fully established when written sources commenced, about 650 BCE.
594	Apollo became extremely important to the Greek world as an oracular deity in the archaic period, and the frequency of theophoric names such as Apollodorus or Apollonios and cities named Apollonia testify to his popularity.
594	Oracular sanctuaries to Apollo were established in other sites.
594	In the 2nd and 3rd century CE, those at Didyma and Clarus pronounced the so-called "theological oracles", in which Apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an all-encompassing, highest deity.
594	"In the 3rd century, Apollo fell silent.
594	Julian the Apostate (359 - 61) tried to revive the Delphic oracle, but failed."
594	Oracular shrines Apollo had a famous oracle in Delphi, and other notable ones in Clarus and Branchidae.
594	His oracular shrine in Abae in Phocis, where he bore the toponymic epithet Abaeus (, Apollon Abaios) was important enough to be consulted by Croesus.
594	His oracular shrines include: * Abae in Phocis * Bassae in the Peloponnese * At Clarus, on the west coast of Asia Minor; as at Delphi a holy spring which gave off a pneuma, from which the priests drank.
594	In Corinth, the Oracle of Corinth came from the town of Tenea, from prisoners supposedly taken in the Trojan War.
594	At Khyrse, in Troad, the temple was built for Apollon Smintheus * In Delos, there was an oracle to the Delian Apollo, during summer.
594	The Hieron (Sanctuary) of Apollo adjacent to the Sacred Lake, was the place where the god was said to have been born.
594	In Delphi, the Pythia became filled with the pneuma of Apollo, said to come from a spring inside the Adyton.
594	In Didyma, an oracle on the coast of Anatolia, south west of Lydian (Luwian) Sardis, in which priests from the lineage of the Branchidae received inspiration by drinking from a healing spring located in the temple.
594	Was believed to have been founded by Branchus, son or lover of Apollo.
594	In Hierapolis Bambyce, Syria (modern Manbij), according to the treatise De Dea Syria, the sanctuary of the Syrian Goddess contained a robed and bearded image of Apollo.
594	Divination was based on spontaneous movements of this image.
594	At Patara, in Lycia, there was a seasonal winter oracle of Apollo, said to have been the place where the god went from Delos.
594	As at Delphi the oracle at Patara was a woman.
594	In Segesta in Sicily Oracles were also given by sons of Apollo.
594	In Oropus, north of Athens, the oracle Amphiaraus, was said to be the son of Apollo; Oropus also had a sacred spring.
594	Labadea, 20 mi east of Delphi, Trophonius, another son of Apollo, killed his brother and fled to the cave where he was also afterwards consulted as an oracle Mythology Birth When Zeus' wife Hera discovered that Leto was pregnant and that Zeus was the father, she banned Leto from giving birth on "terra firma".
594	In her wanderings, Leto found the newly created floating island of Delos, which was neitirma".
594	In her wanderings, Leto found the newly her mainland nor a real island.
594	She gave birth there and was accepted by the people, offering them her promise that her son would be always favourable toward the city.
594	Afterwards, Zeus secured Delos to the bottom of the ocean.
594	This island later became sacred to Apollo.
594	It is also stated that Hera kidnapped Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth, to prevent Leto from going into labor.
594	The other gods tricked Hera into letting her go by offering her a necklace, nine yards (8 m) long, of amber.
594	Mythographers agree that Artemis was born first and then assisted with the birth of Apollo, or that Artemis was born one day before Apollo, on the island of Ortygia and that she helped Leto cross the sea to Delos the next day to give birth to Apollo.
594	Apollo was born on the seventh day () of the month Thargelion —according to Delian tradition—or of the month Bysios—according to Delphian tradition.
594	The seventh and twentieth, the days of the new and full moon, were ever afterwards held sacred to him.
594	Youth Four days after his birth, Apollo killed the chthonic dragon Python, which lived in Delphi beside the Castalian Spring.
594	This was the spring which emitted vapors that caused the oracle at Delphi to give her prophecies.
594	Hera sent the serpent to hunt Leto to her death across the world.
594	To protect his mother, Apollo begged Hephaestus for a bow and arrows.
594	After receiving them, Apollo cornered Python in the sacred cave at Delphi.
594	Apollo killed Python but had to be punished for it, since Python was a child of Gaia.
594	Hera then sent the giant Tityos to kill Leto.
594	This time Apollo was aided by his sister Artemis in protecting their mother.
594	During the battle Zeus finally relented his aid and hurled Tityos down to Tartarus.
594	There he was pegged to the rock floor, covering an area of 9 acre, where a pair of vultures feasted daily on his liver.
594	Trojan War Apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the Greek encampment during the Trojan War in retribution for Agamemnon's insult to Chryses, a priest of Apollo whose daughter Chryseis had been captured.
594	He demanded her return, and the Achaeans complied, indirectly causing the anger of Achilles, which is the theme of the Iliad.
594	In the Iliad, when Diomedes injured Aeneas, Apollo rescued him.
594	First, Aphrodite tried to rescue Aeneas but Diomedes injured her as well.
594	Aeneas was then enveloped in a cloud by Apollo, who took him to Pergamos, a sacred spot in Troy.
594	Apollo aided Paris in the killing of Achilles by guiding the arrow of his bow into Achilles' heel.
594	One interpretation of his motive is that it was in revenge for Achilles' sacrilege in murdering Troilus, the god's own son by Hecuba, on the very altar of the god's own temple.
594	Admetus When Zeus struck down Apollo's son Asclepius with a lightning bolt for resurrecting Hippolytus from the dead (transgressing Themis by stealing Hades's subjects), Apollo in revenge killed the Cyclopes, who had fashioned the bolt for Zeus.
594	Apollo would have been banished to Tartarus forever, but was instead sentenced to one year of hard labor as punishment, due to the intercession of his mother, Leto.
594	During this time he served as shepherd for King Admetus of Pherae in Thessaly.
594	Admetus treated Apollo well, and, in return, the god conferred great benefits on Admetus.
594	Apollo helped Admetus win Alcestis, the daughter of King Pelias and later convinced the Fates to let Admetus live past his time, if another took his place.
594	But when it came time for Admetus to die, his parents, whom he had assumed would gladly die for him, refused to cooperate.
594	Instead, Alcestis took his place, but Heracles managed to "persuade" Thanatos, the god of death, to return her to the world of the living.
594	Niobe Niobe, the queen of Thebes and wife of Amphion, boasted of her superiority to Leto because she had fourteen children (Niobids), seven male and seven female, while Leto had only two.
594	Apollo killed her sons, and Artemis her daughters.
594	Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions of the myth, a number of the Niobids were spared (Chloris, usually).
594	Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, either killed himself or was killed by Apollo after swearing revenge.
594	A devastated Niobe fled to Mount Sipylos in Asia Minor and turned into stone as she wept.
594	Her tears formed the river Achelous.
594	Zeus had turned all the people of Thebes to stone and so no one buried the Niobids until the ninth day after their death, when the gods themselves entombed them.
594	Consorts and children Love affairs ascribed to Apollo are a late development in Greek mythology.
594	Their vivid anecdotal qualities have made favorites some of them of painters since the Renaissance, so that they stand out more prominently in the modern imagination.
594	Female lovers Daphne was a nymph, daughter of the river god Peneus, who had scorned Apollo.
594	The myth explains the connection of Apollo with δάφνη (daphnē), the laurel whose leaves his priestess employed at Delphi.
594	In Ovid's Metamorphoses, Phoebus Apollo chaffs Cupid for toying with a weapon more suited to a man, whereupon Cupid wounds him with a golden dart; simultaneously, however, Cupid shoots a leaden arrow into Daphne, causing her to be repulsed by Apollo.
594	Following a spirited chase by Apollo, Daphne prays to her father, Peneus, for help, and he changes her into the laurel tree, sacred to Apollo.
594	Artemis Daphnaia, who had her temple among the Lacedemonians, at a place called Hypsoi in Antiquity, on the slopes of Mount Cnacadion near the Spartan frontier, had her own sacred laurel trees.
594	At Eretria the identity of an excavated 7th and 6th century temple to Apollo Daphnephoros, "Apollo, laurel-bearer", or "carrying off Daphne", a "place where the citizens are to take the oath", is identified in inscriptions.
594	Leucothea was daughter of Orchamus and sister of Clytia.
594	She fell in love with Apollo who disguised himself as Leucothea's mother to gain entrance to her chambers.
594	Clytia, jealous of her sister because she wanted Apollo for herself, told Orchamus the truth, betraying her sister's trust and confidence in her.
594	Enraged, Orchamus ordered Leucothea to be buried alive.
594	Apollo refused to forgive Clytia for betraying his beloved, and a grieving Clytia wilted and slowly died.
594	Apollo changed her into an incense plant, either heliotrope or sunflower, which follows the sun every day.
594	Marpessa was kidnapped by Idas but was loved by Apollo as well.
594	Zeus made her choose between them, and she chose Idas on the grounds that Apollo, being immortal, would tire of her when she grew old.
594	Castalia was a nymph whom Apollo loved.
594	She fled from him and dove into the spring at Delphi, at the base of Mt.
594	Parnassos, which was then named after her.
594	Water from this spring was sacred; it was used to clean the Delphian temples and inspire the priestesses.
594	In the last oracle is mentioned that the "water which could speak", has been lost for ever.
594	By Cyrene, Apollo had a son named Aristaeus, who became the patron god of cattle, fruit trees, hunting, husbandry and bee-keeping.
594	He was also a culture-hero and taught humanity dairy skills, the use of nets and traps in hunting, and how to cultivate olives.
594	Hecuba, was the wife of King Priam of Troy, and Apollo had a son with her named Troilus.
594	An oracle prophesied that Troy would not be defeated as long as Troilus reached the age of twenty alive.
594	He was ambushed and killed by Achilleus.
594	Cassandra, was daughter of Hecuba and Priam, and Troilus' half-sister.
594	Apollo fell in love with Cassandra and promised her the gift of prophecy to seduce her, but she rejected him afterwards.
594	Enraged, Apollo indeed gifted her with the ability to know the future, with a curse that she could only see the future tragedies and that no one would ever believe her.
594	Coronis, was daughter of Phlegyas, King of the Lapiths.
594	Pregnant with Asclepius, Coronis fell in love with Ischys, son of Elatus.
594	A crow informed Apollo of the affair.
594	When first informed he disbelieved the crow and turned all crows black (where they were previously white) as a punishment for spreading untruths.
594	When he found out the truth he sent his sister, Artemis, to kill Coronis (in other stories, Apollo himself had killed Coronis).
594	As a result he also made the crow sacred and gave them the task of announcing important deaths.
594	Apollo rescued the baby and gave it to the centaur Chiron to raise.
594	Phlegyas was irate after the death of his daughter and burned the Temple of Apollo at Delphi.
594	Apollo then killed him for what he did.
594	In Euripides' play Ion, Apollo fathered Ion by Creusa, wife of Xuthus.
594	Creusa left Ion to die in the wild, but Apollo asked Hermes to save the child and bring him to the oracle at Delphi, where he was raised by a priestess.
594	Acantha, was the spirit of the acanthus tree, and Apollo had one of his other liaisons with her.
594	Upon her death, Apollo transformed her into a sun-loving herb.
594	According to the Biblioteca, the "library" of mythology mis-attributed to Apollodorus, he fathered the Corybantes on the Muse Thalia.

594	He was a Spartan prince, beautiful and athletic.
594	The pair was practicing throwing the discus when a discus thrown by Apollo was blown off course by the jealous Zephyrus and struck Hyacinthus in the head, killing him instantly.
594	Apollo is said to be filled with grief: out of Hyacinthus' blood, Apollo created a flower named after him as a memorial to his death, and his tears stained the flower petals with άί άί, meaning alas.
594	The Festival of Hyacinthus was a celebration of Sparta.
594	Another male lover was Cyparissus, a descendant of Heracles.
594	Apollo gave him a tame deer as a companion but Cyparissus accidentally killed it with a javelin as it lay asleep in the undergrowth.
594	Cyparissus asked Apollo to let his tears fall forever.
594	Apollo granted the request by turning him into the Cypress named after him, which was said to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk.
594	Other male lovers of Apollo include: * Admetus * Atymnius, otherwise known as a beloved of Sarpedon * Branchus (alternately, a son of Apollo) * Carnus * Clarus * Hippolytus of Sicyon (not the same as Hippolytus) * Hymenaios * Iapis * Leucates, who threw himself off a rock when Apollo attempted to carry him off * Phorbas (probably the son of Triopas) * Potnieus Apollo's lyre Hermes was born on Mount Cyllene in Arcadia.
594	The story is told in the Homeric Hymn to Hermes.
594	His mother, Maia, had been secretly impregnated by Zeus.
594	Maia wrapped the infant in blankets but Hermes escaped while she was asleep.
594	Hermes ran to Thessaly, where Apollo was grazing his cattle.
594	The infant Hermes stole a number of his cows and took them to a cave in the woods near Pylos, covering their tracks.
594	In the cave, he found a tortoise and killed it, then removed the insides.
594	He used one of the cow's intestines and the tortoise shell and made the first lyre.
594	Apollo complained to Maia that her son had stolen his cattle, but Hermes had already replaced himself in the blankets she had wrapped him in, so Maia refused to believe Apollo's claim.
594	Zeus intervened and, claiming to have seen the events, sided with Apollo.
594	Hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented.
594	Apollo, a god of music, fell in love with the instrument and offered to allow exchange of the cattle for the lyre.
594	Hence, Apollo then became a master of the lyre.
594	Apollo in the Oresteia In Aeschylus' Oresteia trilogy, Clytemnestra kills her husband, King Agamemnon because he had sacrificed their daughter Iphigenia to proceed forward with the Trojan war, and Cassandra, a prophetess of Apollo.
594	Apollo gives an order through the Oracle at Delphi that Agamemnon's son, Orestes, is to kill Clytemnestra and Aegisthus, her lover.
594	Orestes and Pylades carry out the revenge, and consequently Orestes is pursued by the Erinyes (Furies, female personifications of vengeance).
594	Apollo and the Furies argue about whether the matricide was justified; Apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and Orestes was avenging his father, whereas the Erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage.
594	They invade his temple, and he says that the matter should be brought before Athena.
594	Apollo promises to protect Orestes, as Orestes has become Apollo's supplicant.
594	Apollo advocates Orestes at the trial, and ultimately Athena rules with Apollo.
594	Other stories Apollo killed the Aloadae when they attempted to storm Mt.
594	Olympus.
594	Callimachus sang that Apollo rode on the back of a swan to the land of the Hyperboreans during the winter months.
594	Apollo turned Cephissus into a sea monster.
594	Another contender for the birthplace of Apollo is the Cretan islands of Paximadia.
594	Musical contests Pan Once Pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of Apollo, and to challenge Apollo, the god of the kithara, to a trial of skill.
594	Tmolus, the mountain-god, was chosen to umpire.
594	Pan blew on his pipes, and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower, Midas, who happened to be present.
594	Then Apollo struck the strings of his lyre.
594	Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo, and all but Midas agreed with the judgment.
594	He dissented, and questioned the justice of the award.
594	Apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer, and caused them to become the ears of a donkey.
594	Marsyas Apollo has ominous aspects aside from his plague-bringing, death-dealing arrows: Marsyas was a satyr who challenged Apollo to a contest of music.
594	He had found an aulos on the ground, tossed away after being invented by Athena because it made her cheeks puffy.
594	The contest was judged by the Muses.
594	After they each performed, both were deemed equal until Apollo decreed they play and sing at the same time.
594	As Apollo played the lyre, this was easy to do.
594	Marsyas could not do this, as he only knew how to use the flute and could not sing at the same time.
594	Apollo was declared the winner because of this.
594	Apollo flayed Marsyas alive in a cave near Celaenae in Phrygia for his hubris to challenge a god.
594	He then nailed Marsyas' shaggy skin to a nea] in Phrygia]rby pine-tree.
594	Marsyas' blood turned into the river Marsyas.
594	Another variation is that Apollo played his instrument (the lyre) upside down.
594	Marsyas could not do this with his instrument (the flute), and so Apollo hung him from a tree and flayed him alive.
594	Cinyras Apollo also had a lyre-playing contest with Cinyras, his son, who committed suicide when he lost.
594	Roman Apollo The Roman worship of Apollo was adopted from the Greeks.
594	As a quintessentially Greek god, Apollo had no direct Roman equivalent, although later Roman poets often referred to him as Phoebus.
594	There was a tradition that the Delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the kings of Rome during the reign of Tarquinius Superbus.
594	On the occasion of a pestilence in the 430s BCE, Apollo's first temple at Rome was established in the Flaminian fields, replacing an older cult site there known as the "Apollinare".
594	During the Second Punic War in 212 BCE, the Ludi Apollinares ("Apollonian Games") were instituted in his honor, on the instructions of a prophecy attributed to one Marcius.
594	In the time of Augustus, who considered himself under the special protection of Apollo and was even said to be his son, his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of Rome.
594	After the battle of Actium, which was fought near a sanctuary of Apollo, Augustus enlarged Apollo's temple, dedicated a portion of the spoils to him, and instituted quinquennial games in his honour.
594	He also erected a new temple to the god on the Palatine hill.
594	Sacrifices and prayers on the Palatine to Apollo and Diana formed the culmination of the Secular Games, held in 17 BCE to celebrate the dawn of a new era.
594	Festivals The chief Apollonian festivals were the Boedromia, Carneia, Carpiae, Daphnephoria, Delia, Hyacinthia, Metageitnia, Pyanepsia, Pythia and Thargelia.
594	Attributes and symbols Apollo's most common attributes were the bow and arrow.
594	Other attributes of his included the kithara (an advanced version of the common lyre), the plectrum and the sword.
594	Another common emblem was the sacrificial tripod, representing his prophetic powers.
594	The Pythian Games were held in Apollo's honor every four years at Delphi.
594	The bay laurel plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the crown of victory at these games.
594	The palm tree was also sacred to Apollo because he had been born under one in Delos.
594	Animals sacred to Apollo included wolves, dolphins, roe deer, swans, cicadas (symbolizing music and song), hawks, ravens, crows, snakes (referencing Apollo's function as the god of prophecy), mice and griffins, mythical eagle–lion hybrids of Eastern origin.
594	As god of colonization, Apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies, especially during the height of colonization, 750–550 BCE.
594	According to Greek tradition, he helped Cretan or Arcadian colonists found the city of Troy.
594	However, this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction: Hittite cuneiform texts mention a Minor Asian god called Appaliunas or Apalunas in connection with the city of Wilusa attested in Hittite inscriptions, which is now generally regarded as being identical with the Greek Ilion by most scholars.
594	In this interpretation, Apollo's title of Lykegenes can simply be read as "born in Lycia", which effectively severs the god's supposed link with wolves (possibly a folk etymology).
594	In literary contexts, Apollo represents harmony, order, and reason—characteristics contrasted with those of Dionysus, god of wine, who represents ecstasy and disorder.
594	The contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives Apollonian and Dionysian.
594	However, the Greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary: the two gods are brothers, and when Apollo at winter left for Hyperborea, he would leave the Delphic oracle to Dionysus.
594	This contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the Borghese Vase.
594	Apollo is often associated with the Golden Mean.
594	This is the Greek ideal of moderation and a virtue that opposes gluttony.
594	Apollo in the arts Apollo is a common theme in Greek and Roman art and also in the art of the Renaissance.
594	The earliest Greek word for a statue is "delight" (άγαλμα: agalma), and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision.
594	Greek art puts into Apollo the highest degree of power and beauty that can be imagined.
594	The sculptors derived this from observations on human beings, but they also embodied in concrete form, issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought.
594	The naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body that was essentially a religious activity.
594	The muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the Greek desire for health, and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard Greek environment.
594	The statues of Apollo embody beauty, balance and inspire awe before the beauty of the world.
594	The evolution of the Greek sculpture can be observed in his depictions from the almost static formal Kouros type in early archaic period, to the representation of motion in a relative harmonious whole in late archaic period.
594	In classical Greece the emphasis is not given to theaic period in Greece|late a illusive imaginative reality represented by the ideal forms, but to the analogies and the interaction of the members in the whole, a method created by Polykleitos.
594	Finally Praxiteles seems to be released from any art and religious conformities, and his masterpieces are a mixture of naturalism with stylization.
594	Art and Greek philosophy The evolution of the Greek art seems to go parallel with the Greek philosophical conceptions, which changed from the natural-philosophy of Thales to the metaphysical theory of Pythagoras.
594	Thales searched for a simple material-form directly perceptible by the senses, behind the appearances of things, and his theory is also related to the older animism.
594	This was paralleled in sculpture by the absolute representation of vigorous life, through unnaturally simplified forms.
594	Pythagoras believed that behind the appearance of things, there was the permanent principle of mathematics, and that the forms were based on a transcendental mathematical relation.
594	The forms on earth, are imperfect imitations ( εικών, ikon :image) of the celestial world of numbers.
594	His ideas had a great influence on post-Archaic art, and the Greek architects and sculptors were always trying to find the mathematical relation, that would lead to the esthetic perfection.
594	In classical Greece, Anaxagoras asserted that a divine reason (mind) gave order to the seeds of the universe, and Plato extended the Greek belief of ideal forms to his metaphysical theory of forms (ideai: ideas).
594	The forms on earth are imperfect duplicates of the intellectual celestial ideas.
594	The Greek words "ida" ( οίδα:know) and "idos" (είδος:species) have the same root as the word "idea" (ιδέα), indicating how the Greek mind moved from the gift of the senses, to the principles beyond the senses.
594	The artists in Plato's time moved away from his theories and art tends to be a mixture of naturalism with stylization.
594	The Greek sculptors considered the senses more important, and the proportions were used to unite the sensible with the intellectual.
594	Archaic sculpture Kouros (male youth) is the modern term given to those representations of standing male youths which first appear in the archaic period in Greece.
594	This type served certain religious needs and was first proposed for what was previously thought to be depictions of Apollo.
594	The first statues are certainly still and formal.
594	The formality of their stance seems to be related with the Egyptian precedent, but it was accepted for a good reason.
594	The sculptors had a clear idea of what a young man is, and embodied the archaic smile of good manners, the firm and springy step, the balance of the body, dignity, and youthful happiness.
594	When they tried to depict the most abiding qualities of men, it was because men had common roots with the unchanging gods.
594	The adoption of a standard recognizable type for a long time, is probably because nature gives preference in survival of a type which has long be adopted by the climatic conditions, and also due to the general Greek belief that nature expresses itself in ideal forms that can be imagined and represented.
594	These forms expressed immortality.
594	Apollo was the immortal god of ideal balance and order; his shrine in Delphi has the inscription: "Nothing in excess".
594	In the first large-scale depictions during the early archaic period (640–580 BC), the artists tried to draw one's attention to look into the interior of the face and the body which were not represented as lifeless masses, but as being full of life.
594	The Greeks maintained, until late in their civilization, an almost animistic idea that the statues are in some sense alive.
594	This embodies the belief that the image was somehow the god or man himself.
594	A fine example is the statue of the Sacred gate Kouros which was found at the cemetery of Dipylon in Athens (Dipylon Kouros).
594	The statue is the "thing in itself", and his slender face with the deep eyes express an intellectual eternity.
594	According to the Greek tradition the Dipylon master was named Daedalus, and in his statues the limbs were freed from the body, giving the impression that the statues could move.
594	It is considered that he created also the New York kouros, which is the oldest fully preserved statue of Kouros type, and seems to be the incarnation of the god himself.
594	The animistic idea as the representation of the imaginative reality, is sanctified in the Homeric poems and in Greek myths, in stories of the god Hephaestus (Phaistos) and the mythic Daedalus (the builder of the labyrinth) that made images which moved of their own accord.
594	This kind of art goes back to the Minoan period, when its main theme was the representation of motion in a specific moment.
594	These free-standing statues were usually marble, but also the form rendered in limestone, bronze, ivory and terracotta.
594	The earliest examples of life-sized statues of Apollo, may be two figures from the Ionic sanctuary on the island of Delos.
594	Such statues were found across the Greek speaking world, the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of Apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of Apollo Ptoios, Boeotia alone.
594	The last stage in the development of the Kouros type is the late archaic period (520–485 BC), in which the Greek sculpture attained a full knowledge of human anatomy and used to create a relative harmonious whole.
594	Ranking from the very few bronzes survived to us is the masterpiece bronze Piraeus Apollo.
594	It was found in Piraeus, the harbour of Athens.
594	The statue originally held the bow in its left hand, and a cup of pouring libation in its right hand.
594	It probably comes from north-eastern Peloponnesus.
594	The emphasis is given in anatomy, and it is one of the first attempts to represent a kind of motion, and beauty relative to proportions, which appear mostly in post-Archaic art.
594	The statue throws some light on an artistic centre which, with an independently developed harder, simpler, and heavier style, restricts Ionian influence in Athens.
594	Finally, this is the germ from which the art of Polykleitos was to grow two or three generations later.
594	Classical Sculpture In the next century which is the beginning of the Classical period, it was considered that beauty in visible things as in everything else, consisted of symmetry and proportions.
594	The artists tried also to represent motion in a specific moment (Myron), which may be considered as the reappearance of the dormant Minoan element.
594	Anatomy and geometry are fused in one, and each does something to the other.
594	The Greek sculptors tried to clarify it by looking for mathematical proportions, just as they sought some reality behind appearances.
594	Polykleitos in his Canon wrote that beauty consists in the proportion not of the elements ( materials), but of the parts, that is the interrelation of parts with one another and with the whole.
594	It seems that he was influenced by the theories of Pythagoras.
594	The famous Apollo of Mantua and its variants are early forms of the Apollo Citharoedus statue type, in which the god holds the cithara in his left arm.
594	The type is represented by neo-Attic Imperial Roman copies of the late 1st or early 2nd century, modelled upon a supposed Greek bronze original made in the second quarter of the 5th century BCE, in a style similar to works of Polykleitos but more archaic.
594	The Apollo held the cythara against his extended left arm, of which in the Louvre example, a fragment of one twisting scrolling horn upright remains against his biceps.
594	Though the proportions were always important in Greek art, the appeal of the Greek sculptures eludes any explanation by proportion alone.
594	The statues of Apollo were thought to incarnate his living presence, and these representations of illusive imaginative reality had deep roots in the Minoan period, and in the beliefs of the first Greek speaking people who entered the region during the bronze-age.
594	Just as the Greeks saw the mountains, forests, sea and rivers as inhabited by concrete beings, so nature in all of its manifestations possesses clear form, and the form of a work of art.
594	Spiritual life is incorporated in matter, when it is given artistic form.
594	Just as in the arts the Greeks sought some reality behind appearances, so in mathematics they sought permanent principles which could be applied wherever the conditions were the same.
594	Artists and sculptors tried to find this ideal order in relation with mathematics, but they believed that this ideal order revealed itself not so much to the dispassionate intellect, as to the whole sentient self.
594	Things as we see them, and as they really are, are one, that each stresses the nature of the other in a single unity.
594	Pediments and Friezes In the archaic pediments and friezes of the temples, the artists had a problem to fit a group of figures into an isosceles triangle with acute angles at the base.
594	The Siphnian Treasury in Delphi was one of the first Greek buildings utilizing the solution to put the dominating form in the middle, and to complete the descending scale of height with other figures sitting or kneeling.
594	The pediment shows the story of Heracles stealing Apollo's tripod that was strongly associated with his oracular inspiration.
594	Their two figures hold the centre.
594	In the pediment of the temple of Zeus in Olympia, the single figure of Apollo is dominating the scene.
594	These representations rely on presenting scenes directly to the eye for their own visible sake.
594	They care for the schematic arrangements of bodies in space, but only as parts in a larger whole.
594	While each scene has its own character and completeness it must fit into the general sequence to which it belongs.
594	In these archaic pediments the sculptors use empty intervals, to suggest a passage to and fro a busy battlefield.
594	The artists seem to have been dominated by geometrical pattern and order, and this was improved when classical art brought a greater freedom and economy.
594	Hellenistic Greece-Rome Apollo as a handsome beardless young man, is often depicted with a kithara (as Apollo Citharoedus) or bow in his hand, or reclining on a tree (the Apollo Lykeios and Apollo Sauroctonos types).
594	The Apollo Belvedere is a marble sculpture that was rediscovered in the late 15th century; for centuries it epitomized the ideals of Classical Antiquity for Europeans, from the Renaissance through the 19th century.
594	The marble is a Hellenistic or Roman copy of a bronze original by the Greek sculptor Leochares, made between 350 and 325 BCE.
594	The life-size so-called "Adonis" found in 1780 on the site of a villa suburbana near the Via Labicana in the Roman suburb of Centocelle is identified as an Apollo by modern scholars.
594	In the late 2nd century CE floor mosaic from El Djem, Roman Thysdrus, he is identifiable as Apollo Helios by his effulgent halo, though now even a god's divine nakedness is concealed by his cloak, a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later Empire.
594	Another haloed Apollo in mosaic, from Hadrumentum, is in the museum at Sousse.
594	The conventions of this representation, head tilted, lips slightly parted, large-eyed, curling hair cut in locks grazing the neck, were developed in the 3rd century BCE to depict Alexander the Great.
594	Some time after this mosaic was executed, the earliest depictions of Christ would also be beardless and haloed.
594	Modern reception Apollo has often featured in postclassical art and literature.
594	Percy Bysshe Shelley composed a "Hymn of Apollo" (1820), and the god's instruction of the Muses formed the subject of Igor Stravinsky's Apollon musagète (1927–1928).
594	In discussion of the arts, a distinction is sometimes made between the Apollonian and Dionysian impulses where the former is concerned with imposing intellectual order and the latter with chaotic creativity.
594	Friedrich Nietzsche argued that a fusion of the two was most desirable.
594	Carl Jung's Apollo archetype represents what he saw as the disposition in people to over-intellectualise and maintain emotional distance.
595	Andre Kirk Agassi (; born April 29, 1970, in Las Vegas, Nevada) is an American retired professional tennis player and former World No.
595	Generally considered by critics and fellow players to be one of the greatest tennis players of all time, Agassi has been called the best service returner in the history of the game.
595	Described by the BBC upon his retirement as "perhaps the biggest worldwide star in the sport's history", Agassi compiled performances that, along with his unorthodox apparel and attitude, saw him cited as one of the most charismatic players in the history of the game.
595	As a result, he is credited for helping to revive the popularity of tennis during the 1990s.
595	In singles tennis, Agassi is an eight-time Grand Slam champion who competed in 15 Grand Slam finals and a 1996 Olympic gold medalist.
595	His four Australian Open titles are an Open Era record (shared with Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer).
595	He is one of four male singles players to achieve the Career Grand Slam (all four Grand Slam championships) in the Open Era and one of seven in history, the first of two to achieve the Career Golden Slam (Career Grand Slam and Olympic gold medal), and the only man to win the Career Golden Slam and the ATP Tour World Championships (won in 1990): a distinction dubbed as a "Career Super Slam" by Sports Illustrated.
595	Agassi was the first male player to win all four Grand Slams on three different surfaces (hard, clay and grass), and the last American male to win the French Open (1999) and the Australian Open (2003).
595	He also won 17 ATP Masters Series titles and was part of a winning Davis Cup team in 1990 and 1992.
595	Agassi was troubled by personal issues during the mid-to-late 1990s and sank to world no.
595	Agassi, however, returned to world no.
595	During his 20-plus year tour career, Agassi was known by the nickname "The Punisher".
595	After suffering from sciatica caused by two bulging discs in his back, a spondylolisthesis (vertebral displacement) and a bone spur that interfered with the nerve, Agassi retired from professional tennis on September 3, 2006, after losing in the third round of the US Open.
595	He is the founder of the Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation, which has raised over $60 million for at-risk children in Southern Nevada.
595	In 2001, the Foundation opened the Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy in Las Vegas, a K-12 public charter school for at-risk children.
595	He has been married to fellow tennis star Steffi Graf since 2001.
595	Early life Agassi was born in Las Vegas, Nevada, to Emmanuel "Mike" Agassi and Elizabeth "Betty" Agassi (née Dudley).
595	His father, a former Olympic boxer for Iran, is of Armenian and Assyrian descent and changed the family name to Agassi after his migration to the United States.
595	Andre Agassi's mother, Betty, is a breast cancer survivor.
595	He has three older siblings – Rita (last wife to Pancho Gonzales), Philip and Tami.
595	In a passage from the book Open, Agassi details how his father made him play a match for money with football legend Jim Brown, in 1979, when Agassi was 9 years old.
595	Brown was at a Vegas tennis club complaining to the owner about a money match that was canceled.
595	Agassi's father stepped in and told Brown that he could play his son and he would put up his house for the wager.
595	Brown countered with a $10,000 bet, but after he was warned by the club owner not to take the bet because he would lose and be embarrassed, Brown agreed with Mike Agassi that they would set the amount after he and Andre played two sets.
595	Brown lost those sets, 3–6, 3–6, declined the 10K wager, and offered to play the third set for $500.
595	He lost 2–6.
595	At age 13, Andre was sent to Nick Bollettieri's Tennis Academy in Florida.
595	He was meant to stay for only 3 months because that was all his father could afford.
595	After thirty minutes of watching Agassi play, Bollettieri called Mike and said: "Take your check back.
595	He's here for free," claiming that Agassi had more natural talent than anyone else he had seen.
595	Agassi dropped out of school in the ninth grade.
595	International tennis career biography 1986–1993 He turned professional at the age of 16 and competed in his first tournament at La Quinta, California.
595	He won his first match against John Austin, but then lost his second match to Mats Wilander.
595	By the end of the year, Agassi was ranked world no.
595	He won his first top-level singles title in 1987 at the Sul American Open in Itaparica and ended the year ranked world no.
595	He won six additional tournaments in 1988 (Memphis, U.S.
595	Men's Clay Court Championships, Forest Hills WCT, Stuttgart Outdoor, Volvo International and Livingston Open), and, by December of that year, he had surpassed US$1 million in career prize money after playing in just 43 tournaments—the fastest anyone in history had reached that level.
595	During the year, he set the open-era record for most consecutive victories by a male teenager, a record that stood for 17 years until Rafael Nadal broke it in 2005.
595	His year-end ranking was world no.
595	Ivan Lendl and top-ranked Mats Wilander.
595	Both the Association of Tennis Professionals and Tennis magazine named Agassi the Most Improved Player of the Year for 1988.
595	In addition to not playing the Australian Open (which later became his best Grand Slam event) for the first eight years of his career, Agassi chose not to play at Wimbledon from 1988 through 1990 and publicly stated that he did not wish to play there because of the event's traditionalism, particularly its "predominantly white" dress code to which players at the event are required to conform.
595	Strong performances on the tour meant that Agassi was quickly tipped as a future Grand Slam champion.
595	While still a teenager, he reached the semifinals of both the French Open and the US Open in 1988 and made the US Open semifinals in 1989.
595	He began the 1990s, however, with a series of near-misses.
595	He reached his first Grand Slam final in 1990 at the French Open, where he was favored before losing in four sets to Andrés Gómez.
595	He reached his second Grand Slam final of the year at the US Open, defeating defending champion Boris Becker in the semifinals.
595	His opponent in the final was Pete Sampras; a year earlier, Agassi had crushed Sampras, after which he told his coach that he felt bad for Sampras because he was never going to make it as a pro.
595	Agassi lost the US Open final to Sampras in three sets.
595	The rivalry between these two American players became the dominant rivalry in tennis over the rest of the decade.
595	Also in 1990, Agassi helped the United States win its first Davis Cup in 8 years and won his only Tennis Masters Cup, beating reigning Wimbledon champion Stefan Edberg in the final.
595	In 1991, Agassi reached his second consecutive French Open final, where he faced fellow Bollettieri Academy alumnus Jim Courier.
595	Courier emerged the victor in a five-set final.
595	Agassi decided to play at Wimbledon in 1991, leading to weeks of speculation in the media about the clothes he would wear.
595	He eventually emerged for the first round in a completely white outfit.
595	He reached the quarterfinals on that occasion, losing in five sets to David Wheaton.
595	Agassi's Grand Slam tournament breakthrough came at Wimbledon, not at the French Open or the US Open, where he had previously enjoyed success.
595	In 1992, he defeated Goran Ivanišević in a five-set final.
595	Along the way, Agassi overcame two former Wimbledon champions: Boris Becker and John McEnroe.
595	No other baseliner would triumph at Wimbledon until Lleyton Hewitt ten years later.
595	Agassi was named the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year in 1992.
595	Agassi once again played on the United States' Davis Cup winning team in 1992.
595	It was their second Davis cup title in three years.
595	Agassi win the only doubles title of his career, at the Cincinnati Masters, partnered with Petr Korda.
595	Agassi missed ms title of his career, at the uch of the early part of that year with injuries.
595	Although he made the quarterfinals in his Wimbledon title defense, he lost to eventual champion and world no.
595	Pete Sampras in five sets.
595	Agassi lost in the first round at the US Open to Thomas Enqvist and required wrist surgery late in the year.
595	With new coach Brad Gilbert on board, Agassi began to employ more of a tactical, consistent approach, which fueled his resurgence.
595	He started slowly in 1994, losing in the first week at the French Open and Wimbledon.
595	Nevertheless, he emerged during the hard-court season, winning the Canadian Open.
595	His comeback culminated at the 1994 US Open with a five-set fourth-round victory against compatriot Michael Chang.
595	He then became the first man to capture the US Open as an unseeded player, beating Michael Stich in the final.
595	In 1996, Agassi shaved his balding head, breaking with his old "image is everything" style.
595	He competed in the 1995 Australian Open (his first appearance at the event) and won, beating Sampras in a four-set final.
595	Agassi and Sampras met in five tournament finals in 1995, all on hardcourt, with Agassi winning three.
595	Agassi won three Masters Series events in 1995 (Cincinnati, Key Biscayne, and the Canadian Open) and seven titles total.
595	He compiled a career-best 26-match winning streak during the summer hard-court circuit, which ended when he lost the US Open final to Sampras.
595	Agassi reached the world no.
595	April 1995.
595	He held that ranking until November, for a total of 30 weeks.
595	In terms of win/loss record, 1995 was Agassi's best year.
595	He won 73 matches and lost 9.
595	Agassi was also once again a key player on the United States' Davis Cup winning team—the third and final Davis Cup title of Agassi's career.
595	Agassi, as he failed to reach any Grand Slam final.
595	He suffered two early-round losses at the hands of compatriots Chris Woodruff and Doug Flach at the French Open and Wimbledon, respectively, and lost to Chang in straight sets in the Australian and US Open semifinals.
595	At the time, Agassi blamed the Australian Open loss on the windy conditions, but later said in his biography that he had lost the match on purpose, as he did not want to play Boris Becker, whom he would have faced in that final.
595	The high point for Agassi was winning the men's singles gold medal at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, beating Sergi Bruguera of Spain in the final.
595	Agassi also successfully defended his singles titles in Cincinnati and Key Biscayne.
595	Agassi's career.
595	His wrist injury resurfaced, and he played only 24 matches during the year.
595	He later confessed that he started using crystal methamphetamine at that time, allegedly on the urging of a friend.
595	He failed an ATP drug test, but wrote a letter claiming the same friend had spiked a drink.
595	The ATP dropped the failed drug test as a warning.
595	In his autobiography, Agassi admitted that the letter was a lie.
595	He quit the drug soon after.
595	At this time Agassi was also in a failing marriage with actress Brooke Shields and had lost interest in the game.
595	He won no top-level titles, and his ranking sank to world no.
595	November 10, 1997, prompting many to believe that his run as one of the sport's premier competitors was over and that he would never again win any significant championships.
595	In 1998, Agassi began a rigorous conditioning program and worked his way back up the rankings by playing in Challenger Series tournaments, a circuit for pro players ranked outside the world's top 50.
595	He also played classic matches in this period against Pete Sampras and Patrick Rafter.
595	In 1998, Agassi won five titles and leapt from world no.
595	At Wimbledon, he had an early loss in the second round to Tommy Haas.
595	He won five titles in ten finals and was runner-up at the Masters Series tournament in Key Biscayne, losing to Marcelo Ríos, who became world no.
595	Agassi entered the history books in 1999 when he came back from two sets to love down to beat Andrei Medvedev in a five-set French Open final, becoming, at the time, only the fifth male player (joining Rod Laver, Fred Perry, Roy Emerson and Don Budge—these have since been joined by a sixth, Roger Federer and a seventh, Rafael Nadal) to win all four Grand Slam singles titles during his career.
595	Only Laver, Agassi, Federer and Nadal have achieved this feat during the open era.
595	This win also made him the first (of only three, the second being Roger Federer and the third being Rafael Nadal) male player in history to have won all four Grand Slam titles on three different surfaces (clay, grass and hard courts), a tribute to his adaptability, as the other four men won their Grand Slam titles on clay and grass courts.
595	Agassi also became the first (of only two, the second being Rafael Nadal) male player to win the Career Golden Slam, consisting of all four Grand Slam tournaments plus an Olympic gold medal.
595	Agassi followed his 1999 French Open victory by reaching the Wimbledon final, where he lost to Sampras in straight sets.
595	He rebounded from his Wimbledon defeat by winning the US Open, beating Todd Martin in five sets (rallying from a two sets to one deficit) in the final.
595	Agassi ended 1999 as the world no.
595	Sampras's record of six consecutive year-ending top rankings (1993–1998).
595	This was the only time Agassi ended the year at no.
595	He began the next year by capturing his second Australian Open title, beating Sampras in a five-set semifinal and Yevgeny Kafelnikov in a four-set final.
595	He was the first male player to have reached four consecutive Grand Slam finals since Rod Laver achieved the Grand Slam in 1969.
595	At the time, Agassi was also only the fourth player since Laver to be the reigning champion of three of four Grand Slam events, missing only the Wimbledon title.
595	Agassi reach the semifinals at Wimbledon, where he lost in five sets to Rafter in a match considered by many to be one of the best ever at Wimbledon.
595	At the inaugural Tennis Masters Cup in Lisbon, Agassi reached the final after defeating Marat Safin in the semifinals to end the Russian's hopes to become the youngest world no.
595	Agassi then lost to Gustavo Kuerten in the final, allowing Kuerten to be crowned year-end world no.
595	Agassi opened 2001 by successfully defending his Australian Open title with a straight-sets final win over Arnaud Clément.
595	En route, he beat a cramping Rafter in five sets in front of a sell-out crowd in what turned out to be the Aussie's last Australian Open.
595	At Wimbledon, they met again in the semifinals, where Agassi lost another close match to Rafter, 8–6 in the fifth set.
595	In the quarterfinals at the US Open, Agassi lost a 3 hour, 33 minute epic match with Sampras, 7–6, 6–7, 6–7, 6–7, with no breaks of serve during the 48-game match.
595	Despite the setback, Agassi finished 2001 ranked world no.
595	He also was the oldest player (age 31) to finish in the top three since 32-year old Connors finished at world no.
595	Agassi, as injury forced him to skip the Australian Open, where he was a two-time defending champion.
595	The last duel between Agassi and Sampras came in the final of the US Open, which Sampras won in four sets and left Sampras with a 20–14 edge in their 34 career meetings.
595	The match was the last of Sampras's career.
595	Agassi's US Open finish, along with his Masters Series victories in Key Biscayne, Rome and Madrid, helped him finish 2002 as the oldest year-end world no.
595	In 2003, Agassi won the eighth (and final) Grand Slam title of his career at the Australian Open, where he beat Rainer Schüttler in straight sets in the final.
595	In March, he won his sixth career and third consecutive Key Biscayne title, in the process surpassing his wife, Steffi Graf, who was a five-time winner of the event.
595	The final was his 18th straight win in that tournament, which broke the previous record of 17 set by Sampras from 1993–1995.
595	Agassi's winning streak continued to 20 after winning his first two matches at the 2004 edition of that tournament before bowing to Agustín Calleri.) With the victory, Agassi became the youngest (19 years old) and oldest (32) winner of the Key Biscayne tournament.
595	On April 28, 2003, he recaptured the world no.

595	Ferrero.
595	At the year-end Tennis Masters Cup, Agassi lost in the final to Federer and finished the year ranked world no.
595	At age 33, he was the oldest player to rank in the top 5 since Connors, at age 35, was world no.
595	In 2004, Agassi began the year with a five-set loss in the semifinals of the Australian Open to Marat Safin; the loss ended Agassi's 26-match winning streak at the event, a record that still stands.
595	He won the Masters series event in Cincinnati to bring his career total to 59 top-level singles titles and a record 17 ATP Masters Series titles, having already won seven of the nine ATP Masters tournament—all except the tournaments in Monte Carlo and Hamburg.
595	At 34, he became the second-oldest singles champion in Cincinnati tournament history (the tournament began in 1899), surpassed only by Ken Rosewall, who won the title in 1970 at age 35.
595	He finished the year ranked world no.
595	Connors was world no.
595	Agassi also became only the sixth male player during the open era to reach 800 career wins with his first-round victory over Alex Bogomolov in Countrywide Classic in Los Angeles.
595	Agassi's 2005 began with a quarterfinal loss to Federer at the Australian Open.
595	Agassi had several other deep runs at tournaments, but had to withdraw from several events due to injury.
595	He lost to Jarkko Nieminen in the first round of the French Open.
595	He won his fourth title in Los Angeles and reached the final of the Rogers Cup, before falling to world no.
595	Rafael Nadal.
595	Agassi's 2005 was defined by an improbable run to the US Open final.
595	After beating Răzvan Sabău and Ivo Karlović in straight sets and Tomáš Berdych in four sets, Agassi won three consecutive five-set matches to advance to the final.
595	The most notable of these matches was his quarterfinal victory over James Blake, where he rallied from two sets down to win 7–6 in the fifth set.
595	His other five-set victims were Xavier Malisse in the fourth round and Robby Ginepri in the semifinals.
595	In the final, Agassi faced Federer, who was seeking his second consecutive US Open title and his sixth Grand Slam title in two years.
595	Federer defeated Agassi in four sets, although Agassi gave him a scare when Agassi was up a break in the third set after splitting the first two sets.
595	Before the a scare when Agassi was up a break in the 2005 Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai, Agassi rolled his ankle in a racquetball accident and tore several ligaments.
595	He was unable to walk for weeks.
595	He nevertheless committed to the tournament, in which he was seeded third, and played Nikolay Davydenko in his first round-robin match.
595	Agassi's movement was noticeably hindered, particularly on his backhand return of serve, and he lost in straight sets.
595	He then withdrew from the tournament.
595	Agassi finished 2005 ranked world no.
595	Connors for the most times ranked in the top 10 at year's end.
595	In 2005, Agassi left Nike after 17 years and signed an endorsement deal with Adidas.
595	A major reason for Agassi leaving Nike was because Nike refused to donate to Agassi's charities, and Adidas was more than happy to do so.
595	Agassi had a poor start to 2006.
595	He was still recovering from an ankle injury and also suffering from back and leg pain and lack of match play.
595	Agassi withdrew from the Australian Open because of the ankle injury, and his back injury and other pains forced him to withdraw from several other events, eventually skipping the entire clay-court season, including the French Open.
595	This caused his ranking to drop out of the top 10 for the last time.
595	Agassi returned for the grass-court season, playing a tune-up, and then Wimbledon.
595	He was defeated in the third round by world no.
595	Rafael Nadal.
595	Against conventions, Agassi, the losing player, was interviewed on court after the match.
595	At Wimbledon, Agassi announced his plans to retire following the US Open.
595	Agassi played only two events during the summer hard-court season, with his best result being a quarterfinal loss at the Countrywide Classic in Los Angeles to Fernando González of Chile.
595	As a result, he was unseeded at the US Open.
595	Agassi had a short, but dramatic, run in his final US Open.
595	Because of extreme back pain, Agassi was forced to receive anti-inflammatory injections after every match.
595	After a tough four-set win against Andrei Pavel, Agassi faced eighth-seeded Marcos Baghdatis in the second round, who had earlier advanced to the 2006 Australian Open final and Wimbledon semifinals.
595	Agassi won in five tough sets as the younger Baghdatis succumbed to muscle cramping in the final set.
595	In his last match, Agassi fell to 112th-ranked big-serving Benjamin Becker of Germany in four sets.
595	Agassi received a four-minute standing ovation from the crowd after the match and delivered a retirement speech.
595	Earnings Agassi earned more than US$ 30 million in prize-money during his career, fifth only to Federer, Nadal, Sampras and Djokovic to date.
595	He also earned more than US$25 million a year through endorsements during his career, fourth in all sports at the time.
595	Post-retirement Since retiring after the 2006 US Open, Agassi has participated in a series of charity tournaments and continues his work with his own charity.
595	On September 5, 2007, he was a surprise guest commentator for the Andy Roddick/Roger Federer US Open quarter-final.
595	He played an exhibition match at Wimbledon, teaming with his wife, Steffi Graf, to play with Tim Henman and Kim Clijsters.
595	He played World Team Tennis for the Philadelphia Freedoms in the summer of 2009 and played at the Outback Champions Series event for the first time.
595	He played the Cancer Treatment Centers of America Tennis Championships at Surprise, Arizona, where he reached the final before bowing to eventual champion Todd Martin.
595	On the way to the final, Agassi beat Mikael Pernfors in the quarter-finals and Wayne Ferreira in the semi-finals.
595	He also announced that he will not be playing the tour on a full-time basis, and played the tournament as a favor to long-time friend Jim Courier.
595	At the 2009 French Open, Agassi was on hand to present Roger Federer, who completed his Career Grand Slam by winning the tournament and joined Agassi as one of six men to complete the Career Grand Slam, with the trophy.
595	Playing style Throughout his career Agassi was known for his powerful and precise groundstokes.
595	His phenomenal hand-eye coordination allowed Agassi to take the ball early and redirect it to any part of the court.
595	This relentless aggressive baseliner style put many opponents on the defence and earned Agassi the nickname "The Punisher".
595	While he lacked a dominant serve, Agassi had one of the best serve returns in the history of tennis, often hitting aggressive shots or even winners.
595	While he was growing up, his father and Nick Bollettieri trained him in this way.
595	Personal and family life Agassi was married to Brooke Shields from 1997 to 1999.
595	He married Steffi Graf on October 22, 2001; four days later, their son, Jaden Gil, was born.
595	Their daughter, Jaz Elle, was born in October 2003.
595	Long-time trainer Gil Reyes has been called one of Agassi's closest friends; some have described him as being a "father figure" to Agassi.
595	In 2012, Agassi and Reyes introduced their own line of fitness equipment, BILT By Agassi and Reyes.
595	In December 2008, Agassi's childhood friend and former business manager, Perry Rogers, sued Graf for $50,000 in management fees he claimed that she owed him.
595	Agassi's autobiography, Open (written with assistance from J.
595	R.
595	Moehringer), was published in November 2009.
595	In it, Agassi admitted that he used and tested positive for methamphetamine in 1997.
595	In response to this revelation, Roger Federer declared himself shocked and disappointed.
595	In an exclusive interview with CBS, Agassi justified himself and asked for understanding, saying that  "It was a period in my life where I needed help."
595	He also revealed that he had always hated tennis during his career because of the constant pressure it exerted on him.
595	He also revealed he thought Pete Sampras was "robotic".
595	The book reached No.
595	New York Times Best Seller list and received favorable reviews.
595	It won the Autobiography category of the 2010 British Sports Book Awards.
595	Politics Agassi has donated more than $100,000 to Democratic candidates.
595	However, on September 1, 2010, when he appeared on daily WNYC public radio program "The Brian Lehrer Show," he stated that he is a registered Independent.
595	Philanthropy Agassi founded the Andre Agassi Charitable Association in 1994, which assists Las Vegas' young people.
595	He was awarded the ATP Arthur Ashe Humanitarian award in 1995 for his efforts to help disadvantaged youth.
595	He is regularly cited as the most charitable and socially involved player in professional tennis.
595	It has also been claimed that he may be the most charitable athlete of his generation.
595	Agassi's charities help in assisting children reach their athletic potential.
595	His Boys & Girls Club sees 2,000 children throughout the year and boasts a world-class junior tennis team.
595	It also has a basketball program (the Agassi Stars) and a rigorous system that encourages a mix of academics and athletics.
595	In 2001, Agassi opened the Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy in Las Vegas, a tuition-free charter school for at-risk children in the area.
595	In 2009, the graduating class had 100 percent graduation rate and expected a 100 percent college acceptance rate.
595	Among other child-related programs that Agassi supports through his Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation is Clark County's only residential facility for abused and neglected children, Child Haven.
595	In 1997, Agassi donated funding to Child Haven for a six-room classroom building now named the Agassi Center for Education.
595	His foundation also provided $720,000 to assist in the building of the Andre Agassi Cottage for Medically Fragile Children.
595	This 20-bed facility opened in December 2001, and accommodates developmentally delayed or handicapped children and children quarantined for infectious diseases.

597	The Austroasiatic (Austro-Asiatic) languages, in recent classifications synonymous with Mon–Khmer, are a large language family of continental Southeast Asia, also scattered throughout India, Bangladesh, and the southern border of China.
597	The name Austroasiatic comes from the Latin words for "south" and "Asia", hence "South Asia".
597	Among these languages, only Khmer, Vietnamese, and Mon have a long-established recorded history, and only Vietnamese and Khmer have official status (in Vietnam and Cambodia, respectively).
597	The rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups.
597	Ethnologue identifies 168 Austroasiatic languages.
597	These form thirteen established families (plus perhaps Shompen, which is poorly attested, as a fourteenth), which have traditionally been grouped into two, as Mon–Khmer and Munda.
597	However, recent classifications have abandoned Mon–Khmer as a taxon, either reducing it in scope or making it synonymous with the larger family (Diffloth 2005, Sidwell 2009).
597	Austroasiatic languages have a disjunct distribution across India, Bangladesh and Southeast Asia, separated by regions where other languages are spoken.
597	They appear to be the autochthonous languages of Southeast Asia, with the neighboring Indic, Tai, Dravidian, Austronesian, and Tibeto-Burman languages being the result of later migrations (Sidwell & Blench, 2011).
597	Morphology The Austroasiatic languages are well known for having a "sesquisyllabic" pattern, with basic nouns and verbs consisting of a reduced minor syllable plus a full syllable.
597	Many of them also have infixes.
597	Proto-language Much work has been done on the reconstruction of Proto-Mon–Khmer in Harry L.
597	Shorto's Mon–Khmer Comparative Dictionary.
597	Little work has been done on the Munda languages, which are not well documented; with their demotion from a primary branch, Proto-Mon–Khmer becomes synonymous with Proto-Austroasiatic.
597	Sidwell (2005) reconstructs the consonant inventory of Proto-Mon–Khmer as follows: This is identical to earlier reconstructions except for.
597	Katuic languages, which Sidwell has specialized in.
597	Sidwell (2011) suggests that the likely homeland of Austroasiatic is the middle Mekong, in the area of the Bahnaric and Katuic languages (approximately where modern Laos, Thailand, and Cambodia come together), and that the family is not as old as frequently assumed, dating to perhaps 4000 BCE.
597	Classification Linguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of Austroasiatic: the Mon–Khmer languages of Southeast Asia, Northeast India and the Nicobar Islands, and the Munda languages of East and Central India and parts of Bangladesh.
597	However, no evidence for this classification has ever been published.
597	Each of the families that is written in boldface type below is accepted as a valid clade.
597	By contrast, the relationships between these families within Austroasiatic is debated.
597	In addition to the traditional classification, two recent proposals are given, neither of which accept traditional "Mon–Khmer" as a valid unit.
597	However, little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published, and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review.
597	In addition, there are suggestions that additional branches of Austroasiatic might be preserved in substrata of Acehnese in Sumatra (Diffloth), the Chamic languages of Vietnam, and the Land Dayak languages of Borneo (Adelaar 1995).
597	Sidwell (2009, 2011) Sidwell (2009a), in a lexicostatistical comparison of 36 languages which are well-known enough to exclude loan words, finds little evidence for internal branching, though he did find an area of increased contact between the Bahnaric and Katuic languages, such that languages of all branches apart from the geographically distant Munda and Nicobarese show greater similarity to Bahnaric and Katuic the closer they are to those branches, without any noticeable innovations common to Bahnaric and Katuic.
597	He therefore takes the conservative view that the thirteen branches of Austroasiatic should be treated as equidistant on current evidence.
597	Sidwell & Blench (2011) discuss this proposal in more detail, and note that there is good evidence for a Khasi–Palaungic node, which could also possibly be closely related to Khmuic.
597	If this would the case, Sidwell & Bl/SE%20Asia/SR09/Sidwell%20Blench%20offprint.pdf</rench suggest that Khasic may have been an early offshoot of Palaungic that had spread westward.
597	Sidwell & Blench (2011) suggest Shompen as an additional branch, and believe that a Vieto-Katuic connection is worth investigating.
597	In general, however, the family is thought to have diversified too quickly for a deeply nested structure to have developed, since Proto-Austroasiatic speakers were believed to have radiated out from the central Mekong River valley relatively quickly.
597	Gérard Diffloth (2005) Diffloth compares reconstructions of various clades, and attempts to classify them based on shared innovations, though like other classifications the evidence has not been published.
597	As a schematic, we have: Or in more detail, * Munda languages (India) * Koraput: 7 languages *Core Munda languages :* Kharian–Juang: 2 languages :*North Munda languages :: Korku :: Kherwarian: 12 languages * Khasi–Khmuic languages (Northern Mon–Khmer) * Khasian: 3 languages of eastern India and Bangladesh *Palaungo-Khmuic languages :* Khmuic: 13 languages of Laos and Thailand :*Palaungo-Pakanic languages :: Pakanic or Palyu: 4 or 5 languages of southern China and Vietnam :: Palaungic: 21 languages of Burma, southern China, and Thailand * Nuclear Mon–Khmer languages * Khmero-Vietic languages (Eastern Mon–Khmer) :* Vieto-Katuic languages ?
597	Vietic: 10 languages of Vietnam and Laos, including the Vietnamese language, which has the most speakers of any Austroasiatic language.
597	These are the only Austroasiatic languages to have highly developed tone systems.

597	This family tree is consistent with recent studies of migration of Y-Chromosomal haplogroup O2a1-M95.
597	However, the dates obtained from DNA studies are several times older than that given by linguists.

597	Ilia Peiros (2004) Peiros is a lexicostatistic classification, based on percentages of shared vocabulary.
597	This means that a language may appear to be more distantly related than it actually is due to language contact.

599	Afroasiatic (Afro-Asiatic), also known as Hamito-Semitic (Chamito-Semitic), is a large language family, including 300 or so living languages.
599	Afroasiatic languages are spoken predominantly in the Middle East, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, and parts of the Sahel.
599	More than 300 million people speak an Afroasiatic language.
599	The most widely spoken Afroasiatic language is Arabic (including literary Arabic and the spoken colloquial varieties), with about 200 to 230 million native speakers, spoken mostly in the Middle East and parts of North Africa.
599	Berber (including all its varieties) is spoken in Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, northern Mali, and northern Niger by about 25 to 35 million people.
599	Other widely spoken Afroasiatic languages are Hausa, the dominant language of northern Nigeria and southern Niger, spoken as a first language by 25 million people and used as a lingua franca by another 20 million across the Sahel; Amharic and Oromo of Ethiopia, with 25 million speakers apiece; Somali, spoken by 15 million people in Greater Somalia; and Srew, spoken by about seven million people worldwide.
599	In addition to languages spoken today, Afroasiatic includes several important ancient languages, such as Ancient Egyptian, Akkadian and Biblical Hebrew.
599	Etymology The Afroasiatic language family was originally referred to as "Hamito-Semitic", a term introduced in the 1860s by the German scholar Karl Richard Lepsius.
599	The name was later popularized by Friedrich Müller in his Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft (Wien 1876-88).
599	The term "Afroasiatic" (often now spelled as "Afro-Asiatic") was later coined by Maurice Delafosse (1914).
599	However, it did not come into general use until Joseph Greenberg (1963) formally proposed its adoption.
599	In doing so, Greenberg sought to emphasize the fact that Afroasiatic was the only language family that was represented transcontinentally, in both Africa and Asia.
599	Individual scholars have also called the family "Erythraean" (Tucker 1966) and "Lisramic" (Hodge 1972).
599	In lieu of "Hamito-Semitic", the Russian linguist Igor Diakonoff later suggested the term "Afrasian", meaning "half African, half Asiatic", in reference to the geographic distribution of the phylum's constituent languages.
599	The term "Hamito-Semitic" remains in use in the academic traditions of some European countries.
599	Distribution and branches The Afroasiatic language family is usually considered to include the following branches: * Berber * Chadic * Cushitic * Egyptian * Omotic * Semitic While there is general agreement on these six families, there are some points of disagreement among linguists who study Afroasiatic.
599	In particular: * The Omotic language branch is the most controversial member of Afroasiatic, since the grammatical formatives which most linguists have given greatest weight in classifying languages in the family "are either absent or distinctly wobbly" (Hayward 1995).
599	Greenberg (1963) and others considered it a subgroup of Cushitic, while others have raised doubts about it being part of Afroasiatic at all (e.g.
599	Theil 2006).
599	The Afroasiatic identity of Ongota is also broadly questioned, as is its position within Afroasiatic among those who accept it, due to the "mixed" appearance of the language and a paucity of research and data.
599	Harold Fleming (2006) proposes that Ongota constitutes a separate branch of Afroasiatic.
599	Bonny Sands (2009) believes the most convincing proposal is by Savà and Tosco (2003), namely that Ongota is an East Cushitic language with a Nilo-Saharan substratum.
599	In other words, the Ongota people would appear to have once spoken a Nilo-Saharan language but then shifted to speaking a Cushitic language, while retaining some characteristics of their earlier Nilo-Saharan language.
599	Beja is sometimes listed as a separate branch of Afroasiatic but is more often included in the Cushitic branch, which has a high degree of internal diversity.
599	Whether the various branches of Cushitic actually form a language family is sometimes questioned, but not their inclusion in Afroasiatic itself.
599	There is no consensus on the interrelationships of the five non-Omotic branches of Afroasiatic (see "Subgrouping" below).
599	This situation is not unusual, even among long-established language families: there are also many disagreements concerning the internal classification of the Indo-European languages, for instance.
599	Meroitic has been proposed as an unclassified Afroasiatic language, as it shares the phonotactics characteristic of the family, but there is not enough evidence to secure a classification.
599	Classification history In the 9th century, the Hebrew grammarian Judah ibn Quraysh of Tiaret in Algeria was the first to link two branches of Afroasiatic together; he perceived a relationship between Berber and Semitic.
599	He knew of Semitic through his study of Arabic, Hebrew, and Aramaic.
599	In the course of the 19th century, Europeans also began suggesting such relationships.
599	In 1844, Theodor Benfey suggested a language family consisting of Semitic, Berber, and Cushitic (calling the latter "Ethiopic").

599	Newman suggested a relationship between Semitic and Hausa, but this would long remain a topic of dispute and uncertainty.
599	Friedrich Müller named the traditional "Hamito-Semitic" family in 1876 in his Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft.
599	He defined it as consisting of a Semitic group plus a "Hamitic" group containing Egyptian, Berber, and Cushitic; he excluded the Chadic group.
599	These classifications relied in part on non-linguistic anthropological and racial arguments that have largely been discredited (see Hamitic hypothesis).
599	Leo Reinisch (1909) proposed linking Cushitic and Chadic, while urging a more distant affinity to Egyptian and Semitic, thus foreshadowing Greenberg, but his suggestion found little resonance.
599	Marcel Cohen (1924) rejected the idea of a distinct Hamitic subgroup and included Hausa (a Chadic language) in his comparative Hamito-Semitic vocabulary.
599	Joseph Greenberg (1950) strongly confirmed Cohen's rejection of "Hamitic", added (and sub-classified) the Chadic branch, and proposed the new name "Afroasiatic" for the family.
599	Nearly all scholars have accepted Greenberg's classification.
599	In 1969, Harold Fleming proposed that what had previously been known as Western Cushitic is an independent branch of Afroasiatic, suggesting for it the new name Omotic.
599	This proposal and name have met with widespread acceptance.
599	Several scholars, including Harold Fleming and Robert Hetzron, have since questioned the traditional inclusion of Beja in Cushitic.
599	Subgrouping Little agreement exists on the subgrouping of the five or six branches of Afroasiatic: Semitic, Egyptian, Berber, Chadic, Cushitic, and Omotic.
599	However, Christopher Ehret (1979), Harold Fleming (1981), and Joseph Greenberg (1981) all agree that the Omotic branch split from the rest first.
599	Otherwise: * Paul Newman (1980) groups Berber with Chadic and Egyptian with Semitic, while questioning the inclusion of Omotic in Afroasiatic.
599	Rolf Theil (2006) concurs with the exclusion of Omotic, but does not otherwise address the structure of the family.
599	Harold Fleming (1981) divides non-Omotic Afroasiatic, or "Erythraean", into three groups, Cushitic, Semitic, and Chadic-Berber-Egyptian.
599	He later added Semitic and Beja to Chadic-Berber-Egyptian and tentatively proposed Ongota as a new third branch of Erythraean.
599	He thus divided Afroasiatic into two major branches, Omotic and Erythraean, with Erythraean consisting of three sub-branches, Cushitic, Chadic-Berber-Egyptian-Semitic-Beja, and Ongota.
599	Like Harold Fleming, Christopher Ehret (1995: 490) divides Afroasiatic into two branches, Omotic and Erythrean.
599	He divides Omotic into two branches, North Omotic and South Omotic.
599	He divides Erythrean into Cushitic, comprising Beja, Agaw, and East-South Cushitic, and North Erythrean, comprising Chadic and "Boreafrasian."
599	According to his classification, Boreafrasian consists of Egyptian, Berber, and Semitic.
599	Vladimir Orel and Olga Stolbova (1995) group Berber with Semitic and Chadic with Egyptian.
599	They split up Cushitic into five or more independent branches of Afroasiatic, viewing Cushitic as a Sprachbund rather than a language family.
599	Igor M.
599	Diakonoff (1996) subdivides Afroasiatic in two, grouping Berber, Cushitic, and Semitic together as East-West Afrasian (ESA), and Chadic with Egyptian as North-South Afrasian (NSA).
599	He excludes Omotic from Afroasiatic.
599	Lionel Bender (1997) groups Berber, Cushitic, and Semitic together as "Macro-Cushitic".
599	He regards Chadic and Omotic as the branches of Afroasiatic most remote from the others.
599	Alexander Militarev (2000), on the basis of lexicostatistics, groups Berber with Chadic and both more distantly with Semitic, as against Cushitic and Omotic.
599	He places Ongota in South Omotic.
599	Position among the world's languages Afroasiatic is one of the four language families of Africa identified by Joseph Greenberg in his book The Languages of Africa (1963).
599	It is the only one that extends outside of Africa, via the Semitic branch.
599	There are no generally accepted relations between Afroasiatic and any other language family.
599	However, several proposals grouping Afroasiatic with one or more other language families have been made.
599	The best-known of these are the following: * Hermann Möller (1906) argued for a relation between Semitic and the Indo-European languages.
599	This proposal was accepted by some linguists (e.g.
599	Holger Pedersen and Louis Hjelmslev) but has little currency today.
599	For a fuller account, see Indo-Semitic languages.) * Apparently influenced by Möller (a colleague of his at the University of Copenhagen), Holger Pedersen included Hamito-Semitic (the term replaced by Afroasiatic) in his proposed Nostratic macro-family (cf.
599	Pedersen 1931:336–338), which also included the Indo-European, Finno-Ugric, Samoyed, Turkish, Mongolian, Manchu, and Yukaghir languages.
599	This inclusion was retained by subsequent Nostraticists, starting with Vladislav Illich-Svitych and Aharon Dolgopolsky.
599	Joseph Greenberg (2000–2002) did not reject a relationship of Afroasiatic to these other languages, but he considered it more distantly related to them than they were to each other, grouping instead these other languages in a separate macro-family, which he called Eurasiatic, and to which he added Chukotian, Gilyak, Korean, Japanese-Ryukyuan, Eskimo–Aleut, and Ainu.
599	Most recently, Sergei Starostin's school has accepted Eurasiatic as a subgroup of Nostratic, with Afroasiatic, Dravidian, and Kartvelian in Nostratic outside of Eurasiatic.
599	An even larger Borean group would contain Nostratic as well as Dené-Caucasian and Austric.
599	Date of Afroasiatic The earliest written evidence of an Afroasiatic language is an Ancient Egyptian inscription of c.
599	BC (5,400 years ago).
599	Symbols on Gerzean pottery resembling Egyptian hieroglyphs date back to c.
599	BC, suggesting a still earlier possible date.
599	This gives us a minimum date for the age of Afroasiatic.
599	However, Ancient Egyptian is highly divergent from Proto-Afroasiatic (Trombetti 1905: 1–2), and considerable time must have elapsed in between them.
599	Estimates of the date at which the Proto-Afroasiatic language was spoken vary widely.
599	They fall within a range between approximately 7500 BC (9,500 years ago) and approximately 16,000 BC (18,000 years ago).
599	According to Igor M.
599	Diakonoff (1988: 33n), Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c.
599	BC.
599	According to Christopher Ehret (2002: 35–36), Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c.
599	BC at the latest and possibly as early as c.
599	BC.
599	These dates are older than dates associated with most other proto-languages.
599	Afroasiatic Urheimat The term Afroasiatic Urheimat (Urheimat meaning "original homeland" in German) refers to the 'hypothetical' place where Proto-Afroasiatic speakers lived in a single linguistic community, or complex of communities, before this original language dispersed geographically and divided into distinct languages.
599	Afroasiatic languages are today primarily spoken in the Middle East, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, and parts of the Sahel.
599	There is no agreement on when and where this Urheimat existed, though the language is generally believed to have originated somewhere in or near the region stretching from the Levant/Near East to the area between the Eastern Sahara and the Horn of Africa, including Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan.
599	Similarities in grammar and syntax Widespread (though not universal) features of the Afroasiatic languages include: * A set of emphatic consonants, variously realized as glottalized, pharyngealized, or implosive.
599	VSO typology with SVO tendencies.
599	A two-gender system in the singular, with the feminine marked by the sound /t/.
599	All Afroasiatic subfamilies show evidence of a causative affix s.
599	Semitic, Berber, Cushitic (including Beja), and Chadic support possessive suffixes.
599	Morphology in which words inflect by changes within the root (vowel changes or gemination) as well as with prefixes and suffixes.
599	One of the most remarkable shared features among the Afroasiatic languages is the prefixing verb conjugation (see table above), with a distinctive pattern of prefixes beginning with /ʔ t n y/, and in particular a pattern whereby third-singular masculine /y-/ is opposed to third-singular feminine and second-singular /t-/.
599	Tonal languages appear in the Omotic, Chadic, and Cushitic branches of Afroasiatic, according to Ehret (1996).
599	The Semitic, Berber, and Egyptian branches do not use tones phonemically.
599	Shared vocabulary Following are some examples of Afroasiatic cognates, including ten pronouns, three nouns, and three verbs.
599	Source: Christopher Ehret, Reconstructing Proto-Afroasiatic (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995).
599	Note: Ehret does not make use of Berber in his etymologies, stating (1995: 12): "the kind of extensive reconstruction of proto-Berber lexicon that might help in sorting through alternative possible etymologies is not yet available."
599	The Berber cognates here are taken from previous version of table in this article and need to be completed and referenced.
599	Abbreviations: NOm 'North Omotic', SOm   'South Omotic'.
599	MSA 'Modern South Arabian', PSC   'Proto-Southern Cushitic', PSom-II 'Proto-Somali, stage 2'.
599	Symbols: Following Ehret (1995: 70), a caron ˇ over a vowel indicates rising tone, a circumflex ^ over a vowel indicates falling tone.
599	V indicates a vowel of unknown timbre.
599	There are two etymological dictionaries of Afroasiatic, one by Christopher Ehret, and one by Vladimir Orel and Olga Stolbova.
599	The two dictionaries disagree on almost everything.

600	Andorra (;,), officially the Principality of Andorra (), also called the Principality of the Valleys of Andorra, (), is a landlocked microstate in Southwestern Europe, located in the eastern Pyrenees mountains and bordered by Spain and France.
600	It is the sixth smallest nation in Europe, having an area of 468 km² and an estimated population of 85,000 in 2012.
600	Its capital, Andorra la Vella, is the highest capital city in Europe, at an elevation of 1023 m above sea level.
600	The official language is Catalan, although Spanish, Portuguese, and French are also commonly spoken.
600	Created under a charter in 988, the present Principality was formed in 1278.
600	It is known as a principality as it is a monarchy headed by two co-princes – the Bishop of Urgell and the President of France.
600	Andorra is a prosperous country mainly because of its tourism industry, which services an estimated 10.2 million visitors annually, and also because of its status as a tax haven.
600	It is not a member of the European Union, but the euro is the de facto currency.
600	The people of Andorra have the 4th highest human life expectancy in the world — 82 years at birth.
600	History Tradition holds that Charles the Great (Charlemagne) granted a charter to the Andorran people in return for fighting against the Moors.
600	Overlordship of the territory was by the Count of Urgell and eventually by the bishop of the Diocese of Urgell.
600	In 988, Borrell II, Count of Urgell, gave the Andorran valleys to the Diocese of Urgell in exchange for land in Cerdanya.
600	Since then the Bishop of Urgell, based in Seu d'Urgell, has owned Andorra.
600	Before 1095, Andorra did not have any type of military protection and the Bishop of Urgell, who knew that the Count of Urgell wanted to reclaim the Andorran valleys, asked for help and protection from the Lord of Caboet.
600	In 1095, the Lord of Caboet and the Bishop of Urgell signed under oath a declaration of their co-sovereignty over Andorra.
600	Arnalda, daughter of Arnau of Caboet, married the Viscount of Castellbò and both became Viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya.
600	Years later their daughter, Ermessenda, married Roger Bernat II, the French Count of Foix.
600	They became Roger Bernat II and Ermessenda I, Counts of Foix, Viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya, and also co-sovereigns of Andorra (shared with the Bishop of Urgell).
600	In the 11th century, a dispute arose between the Bishop of Urgell and the Count of Foix.
600	The conflict was resolved in 1278 with the mediation of Aragon by the signing of the first paréage which provided that Andorra's sovereignty be shared between the count of Foix (whose title would ultimately transfer to the French head of state) and the Bishop of Urgell, in Catalonia.
600	This gave the principality its territory and political form.
600	Over the years, the co-title to Andorra passed to the kings of Navtical form.
600	Over the years, the co-tiarre.
600	After Henry of Navarre became King Henry IV of France, he issued an edict in 1607 that established the head of the French state and the Bishop of Urgell as co-princes of Andorra.
600	In 1812–13, the First French Empire annexed Catalonia and divided it in four départements, with Andorra being made part of the district of Puigcerdà (département of Sègre).
600	Andorra declared war on Imperial Germany during World War I, but did not actually take part in the fighting.
600	It remained in an official state of belligerency until 1958 as it was not included in the Treaty of Versailles.
600	In 1933, France occupied Andorra as a result of social unrest before elections.
600	On July 12, 1934, adventurer Boris Skossyreff issued a proclamation in Urgell, declaring himself "Boris I, King of Andorra", simultaneously declaring war on the Bishop of Urgell.
600	He was arrested by Spanish authorities on July 20 and ultimately expelled from Spain.
600	From 1936 to 1940, a French detachment was garrisoned in Andorra to prevent influences of the Spanish Civil War and Francoist Spain.
600	Francoist troops reached the Andorran border in the later stages of the war.
600	During World War II, Andorra remained neutral and was an important smuggling route between Vichy France and Spain.
600	Given its relative isolation, Andorra has existed outside the mainstream of European history, with few ties to countries other than France and Spain.
600	In recent times, however, its thriving tourist industry along with developments in transport and communications have removed the country from its isolation.
600	Its political system was modernised in 1993, when it became a member of the United Nations and the Council of Europe.
600	Politics Andorra is a parliamentary co-principality with the President of France and the Bishop of Urgell (Catalonia, Spain), as co-princes.
600	This peculiarity makes the President of France, in his capacity as Prince of Andorra, an elected reigning monarch, even though he is not elected by a popular vote of the Andorran people.
600	The politics of Andorra take place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democracy, whereby the Prime Minister of Andorra is the head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system.
600	The current Prime Minister is Antoni Martí of the Democrats for Andorra (DA).
600	Executive power is exercised by the government.
600	Legislative power is vested in both  government and parliament.
600	The Parliament of Andorra is known as the General Council.
600	The General Council consists of between 28 and 42 Councillors, as the members of the legislative branch are called.
600	The Councillors serve for four-year terms and elections are held between the thirtieth and fortieth days following the dissolution of the previous Council.
600	The Councillors can be elected on two equal constituencies.
600	Half are elected in equal number from each of the seven administrative parishes and the other half of the Councillors are elected from a single national constituency.
600	Councillors hold their inauguration.
600	During this session, the Syndic General, who is the head of the General Council, and the Subsyndic General, his assistant, are elected.
600	Eight days later, the Council convenes once more.
600	During this session the Head of Government, the Prime Minister of Andorra, is chosen from among the Councillors.
600	Candidates for the prime-ministerial nomination can be proposed by a minimum of one-fifth of the Councillors.
600	The Council then elects the candidate with the absolute majority of votes to be Head of Government.
600	The Syndic General then notifies the Co-princes who in turn appoint the elected candidate as the Prime Minister of Andorra.
600	The General Council is also responsible for proposing and passing laws.
600	Bills may be presented to the Council as Private Members' Bills by three of the Local Parish Councils jointly or by at least one tenth of the citizens of Andorra.
600	The Council also approves the annual budget of the principality.
600	The government must submit the proposed budget for parliamentary approval at least two months before the previous budget expires.
600	If the budget is not approved by the first day of the next year, the previous budget is extended until a new one is approved.
600	Once any bill is approved, the Syndic General is responsible for presenting it to the Co-princes so that they may sign and enact it.
600	If the Head of Government is not satisfied with the Council, he may request that the Co-princes dissolve the Council and order new elections.
600	In turn, the Councillors have the power to remove the Head of Government from office.
600	After a motion of censure is approved by at least one-fifth of the Councillors, the Council will vote and if it receives the absolute majority of votes, the Prime Minister is removed.
600	Law and criminal justice The judiciary is composed of the Magistrates Court, the Criminal Law Court, the High Court of Andorra, and the Constitutional Court.
600	The High Court of Justice is composed of five judges: one appointed by the Head of Government, one each by the Coprinces, one by the Syndic General, and one by the Judges and Magistrates.
600	It is presided over by the member appointed by the Syndic General and the judges hold office for six-year terms.
600	The Magistrates and Judges are appointed by the High Court, and so is the President of the Criminal Law Court.
600	The High Court also appoints members of the Office of the Attorney General.
600	The Constitutional Court is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and reviewing all appeals of unconstitutionality against laws and treaties.
600	It is composed of four judges, one appointed by each of the Coprinces and two by the General Council.
600	They serve eight-year terms.
600	The Court is presided over by one of the Judges on a two-year rotation so that each judge at one point will be the leader of the Court.
600	Foreign relations, defence, and security Andorra does not have its own armed forces, although there is a small ceremonial Army.
600	Responsibility for defending the nation rests primarily with France and Spain.
600	However, in case of emergencies or natural disasters, the Sometent (an alarm) is called and all able-bodied men between 21 and 60 of Andorran nationality must serve.
600	This is why all Andorrans, and especially the head of each house (usually the eldest able-bodied man of a house), should by law, keep a rifle, even though the law also states that the police will offer a fire-arm in case of need.keep a rifle, even  Andorra is a full member of the United Nations (UN), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and has a special agreement with the European Union (EU).
600	Military Andorra has a small army, which has historically been raised or reconstituted at various dates, but has never in modern times amounted to a standing army.
600	The basic principle of Andorran defence is that all able-bodied men are available to fight if called upon by the sounding of the Sometent.
600	The duties of the Andorran Army are entirely ceremonial.
600	In the modern era, the army has consisted of a very small body of volunteers willing to undertake ceremonial duties.
600	Uniforms were handed down from generation to generation within families and communities.
600	Despite not being involved in any fighting, Andorra was technically the longest combatant in the First World War, as the country was left out of the Versailles Peace Conference, and technically remained at war with Germany from 1914 until 1939.
600	The army's role in internal security was largely taken over by the formation of the Police Corps of Andorra in 1931.
600	Brief civil disorder associated with the elections of 1933, led to assistance being sought from the French police, with a detachment resident in Andorra for two months under the command of René-Jules Baulard.
600	The Andorran Army was reformed in the following year, with eleven soldiers appointed to supervisory roles.
600	The force consisted of six Corporals, one for each parish (although there are currently seven parishes, there were only six until 1978), plus four junior staff officers to coordinate action, and a commander with the rank of Major.
600	It was the responsibility of the six corporals, each in his own parish, to be able to raise a fighting force from among the able-bodied men of the parish.
600	Today a small, 12-man ceremonial unit remains the only permanent section of the Andorran army, but all able-bodied men remain technically available for military service, with a requirement for each family to have access to a firearm.
600	The army has not fought for more than 700 years, and its main responsibility is to present the Andorran flag at official ceremonial functions.
600	According to Marc Forné Molné, Andorra's military budget is strictly from voluntary donations, and the availability of full-time voluntaries.
600	The myth that all members of the Andorran Army are ranked as officers, is popularly maintained in many works of reference.
600	In reality, all those serving in the permanent ceremonial reserve hold ranks as officers, or non-commissioned officers, because the other ranks are considered to be the rest of the able-bodied male population, who may still be called upon by the Sometent to serve, although such a call has not been made in modern times.
600	GIPA The Grup d'Intervenció Policia d'Andorra (GIPA) is a small special forces unit trained in counter-terrorism, and hostage recovery tasks.
600	Although it is the closest in style to an active military force, it is part of the Police Corps, and not the Army.
600	As terrorist and hostage situations are a rare threat to the nation, the GIPA is commonly assigned to prisoner escort duties, and at other times to routine policing.
600	Police Corps Andorra maintains a small, but modern and well-equipped internal police force with around 240 police officers, supported by civilian assistants.
600	The principal services supplied by the Corps are uniformed community policing, criminal detection, border control, and traffic policing.
600	There are also small specialist units including police dogs, mountain rescue, and bomb disposal.
600	Fire Brigade The Andorran Fire Brigade, with headquarters at Santa Coloma, operates from four modern fire stations, and has a staff of around 120 firefighters.
600	The service is equipped with 16 heavy appliances (fire tenders, turntable ladders, and specialist four-wheel drive vehicles), 4 light support vehicles (cars and vans), and 4 ambulances.
600	Historically, the families of the six ancient parishes of Andorra maintained local arrangements to assist each other in fighting fires.
600	The first fire pump purchased by the government was acquired in 1943.
600	The serious fires (which lasted for two days) in parts of the principality in December 1959 led to calls for a permanent fire service, and the Andorran Fire Brigade was formed on 21 April 1961.
600	The fire service maintains full-time cover with five fire crews on duty at any time - two at the brigade's headquarters in Santa Coloma, and one crew at each of the other three fire stations.
600	Geography Parishes Andorra consists of seven parishes: * Andorra la Vella * Canillo * Encamp * Escaldes-Engordany * La Massana * Ordino * Sant Julià de Lòria Physical geography Due to its location in the eastern Pyrenees mountain range, Andorra consists predominantly of rugged mountains, the highest being the Coma Pedrosa at 2942 m, and the average elevatiountains, the hn of Andorra is 1996 m.
600	These are dissected by three narrow valleys in a Y shape that combine into one as the main stream, the Gran Valira river, leaves the country for Spain (at Andorra's lowest point of 840 m).
600	Andorra's land area is 468 km2.
600	Phytogeographically, Andorra belongs to the Atlantic European province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom.
600	According to the WWF, the territory of Andorra belongs to the ecoregion of Pyrenees conifer and mixed forests.
600	Climate Andorra has an alpine climate and continental climate.
600	Its higher elevation means there is, on average, more snow in winter, lower humidity, and it is slightly cooler in summer.
600	There are, on average, 300 days per year of sunshine.
600	Economy Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's tiny, well-to-do economy, accounts for roughly 80% of GDP.
600	An estimated 10.2 million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts.
600	Andorra's relative advantage has recently eroded as the economies of adjoining France and Spain have been opened up, providing broader availability of goods and lower tariffs.
600	The banking sector, with its tax haven status, also contributes substantially to the economy.
600	Agricultural production is limited—only 2% of the land is arable—and most food has to be imported.
600	Some tobacco is grown locally.
600	The principal livestock activity is domestic sheep raising.
600	Manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture.
600	Andorra's natural resources include hydroelectric power, mineral water, timber, iron ore, and lead.
600	Andorra is not a member of the European Union, but enjoys a special relationship with it, such as being treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU member for agricultural products.
600	Andorra lacked a currency of its own and used both the French franc and the Spanish peseta in banking transactions until 31 December 1999, when both currencies were replaced by the EU's single currency, the euro.

600	Demography Population The population of Andorra is estimated to be 85,082 (July 2011).
600	The population has grown from 5,000 in 1900.
600	Andorran nationals are a plurality in the country (31,363 / 33%); other nationalities include Spaniards (27,300 / 23%), Portuguese (13,794 / 21%), French (5,213 / 17%), Britons (1,085) and Italians.
600	The main part of the population in Andorra is made up of citizens without Andorran nationality, who do not have the right to vote (suffrage) in communal elections.
600	Moreover, they are not allowed to be elected as president or to own more than 33% of the capital stock of a privately held company.
600	Languages The historic and official language is Catalan, a Romance language.
600	The Andorran government is keen to encourage the use of Catalan.
600	It funds a Commission for Catalan Toponymy in Andorra (Catalan: la Comissió de Toponímia d'Andorra), and provides free Catalan classes to assist immigrants.
600	Andorran television and radio stations use Catalan.
600	Because of immigration, historical links, and close geographic proximity, Spanish, Portuguese and French are also commonly spoken.
600	Most Andorran residents can speak one or more of these, in addition to Catalan.
600	English is less commonly spoken among the general population, though it is understood to varying degrees in the major tourist resorts.
600	Andorra is one of only three European countries (together with France and Monaco) that have never signed the Council of Europe Framework Convention on National Minorities.

600	It was established in 1997.
600	The University provides first-level degrees in nursing, computer science, business administration, and educational sciences, in addition to higher professional education courses.
600	The only two graduate schools in Andorra are the Nursing School and the School of Computer Science, the latter having a PhD programme.
600	Virtual Studies Centre The geographical complexity of the country as well as the small number of students prevents the University of Andorra from developing a full academic program, and it serves principally as a centre for virtual studies, connected to Spanish and French universities.
600	The Virtual Studies Centre (Centre d’Estudis Virtuals) at the University runs in the region of twenty degrees at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels in fields including tourism, law, Catalan philology, humanities, psychology, political sciences, audiovisual communication, telecommunications engineering, and East Asia studies.
600	The Centre also runs various postgraduate programs and continuing-education courses for professionals.
600	Healthcare Healthcare in Andorra is provided to all employed persons and their families by the government-run social security system, CASS (Caixa Andorrana de Seguretat Social), which is funded by employer and employee contributions in respect of salaries.
600	The cost of healthcare is covered by CASS at rates of 75% for out-patient expenses such as medicines and hospital visits, 90% for hospitalisation, and 100% for work-related accidents.
600	The remainder of the costs may be covered by private health insurance.
600	Other residents and tourists require full private health insurance.
600	The main hospital, Meritxell, is in Escaldes-Engordany.
600	There are also 12 primary health care centres in various locations around the Principality.
600	Transport Until the 20th century, Andorra had very limited transport links to the outside world, and development of the country was affected by its physical isolation.

612	In mathematics and >       /* Definistatistics, the arithmetic mean, or simply the mean or average when the context is clear, is the central tendency of a collection of numbers taken as the sum of the numbers divided by the size of the collection.
612	The collection is often the sample space of an experiment.
612	The term "arithmetic mean" is preferred in mathematics and statistics because it helps distinguish it from other means such as the geometric and harmonic mean.
612	In addition to mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean is used frequently in fields such as economics, sociology, and history, though it is used in almost every academic field to some extent.
612	For example, per capita GDP gives an approximation of the arithmetic average income of a nation's population.
612	While the arithmetic mean is often used to report central tendencies, it is not a robust statistic, meaning that it is greatly influenced by outliers.
612	Notably, for skewed distributions, the arithmetic mean may not accord with one's notion of "middle", and robust statistics such as the median may be a better description of central tendency.
612	Definition Suppose we have sample space .
612	Then the arithmetic mean  is defined via the expression .
612	If the list is a statistical population, then the mean of that population is called a population mean.
612	If the list is a statistical sample, we call the resulting statistic a sample mean.
612	The arithmetic mean of a variable is often denoted by a bar, for example  (read "x bar") would be the mean of some sample space .
612	Motivating properties The arithmetic mean has several properties that make it useful, especially as a measure of central tendency.
612	These include: *If numbers  have mean X, then .
612	Since  is the distance from a given number to the mean, one way to interpret this property is as saying that the numbers to the left of the mean are balanced by the numbers to the right of the mean.
612	The mean is the only single number for which the residuals defined this way sum to zero.
612	If it is required to use a single number X as an estimate for the value of numbers , then the arithmetic mean does this best, in the sense of minimizing the sum of squares (xi − X)2 of the residuals.
612	It follows that the mean is also the best single predictor in the sense of having the lowest root mean squared error.) *For a normal distribution, the arithmetic mean is equal to both the median and the mode, other measures of central tendency.
612	Problems The arithmetic mean may be misinterpreted as the median to imply that most values are higher or lower than is actually the case.
612	If elements in the sample space increase arithmetically, when placed in some order, then the median and arithmetic average are equal.
612	For example, consider the sample space {1,2,3,4}.
612	The average is 2.5, as is the median.
612	However, when we consider a sample space that cannot be arranged into an arithmetic progression, such as {1,2,4,8,16}, the median and arithmetic average can differ significantly.
612	In this case the arithmetic average is 6.2 and the median is 4.
612	When one looks at the arithmetic average of a sample space, one must note that the average value can vary significantly from most values in the sample space.
612	There are applications of this phenomenon in many fields.
612	For example, since the 1980s in the United States median income has increased more slowly than the arithmetic average of income.
612	Researchers dealing with frequency data must also be careful when reporting summary statistics such as means or median.
612	Angles Particular care must be taken when using cyclic data such as phases or angles.
612	Naïvely taking the arithmetic mean of 1° and 359° yields a result of 180°.
612	This is incorrect for two reasons: *Firstly, angle measurements are only defined up to a factor of 360° (or 2π, if measuring in radians).
612	Thus one could as easily call these 1° and −1°, or 1° and 179° – each of which gives a different average.
612	Secondly, in this situation, 0° (equivalently, 360°) is geometrically a better average value: there is lower dispersion about it (the points are both 1° from it, and 179° from 180°, the putative average).
612	In general application such an oversight will lead to the average value artificially moving towards the middle of the numerical range.
612	A solution to this problem is to use the optimization formulation (viz, define the mean as the central point: the point about which one has the lowest dispersion), and redefine the difference as a modular distance (i.e., the distance on the circle: so the modular distance between 1° and 359° is 2°, not 358°).
615	The American Football Conference (AFC) is one of the two conferences of the National Football League (NFL).
615	This conference and its counterpart, the National Football Conference (NFC), currently contain 16 teams each, making up the 32 teams of the NFL.
615	The American Football Conference originated as the American Football League (AFL), with which the NFL combined in the AFL–NFL merger of 1970.
615	Ten AFC teams originally formed the AFL, while three others were NFL teams that were added to the AFC to equalize the number of franchises, and another three are more recent expansion teams (one, the Houston Texans, plays in the market from which one of the AFL's founding teams, now known as the Tennessee Titans, originated).
615	Current teams Since 2002, the AFC has 16 teams, organized into four divisions each with four teams: East, North, South, and West.
615	Season structure Each AFC team plays the other teams in its division twice (home and away) during the regular season, in addition to 10 other games assigned to their schedule by the NFL the previous May.
615	Two of these games are assigned on the basis of the team's final division standing in the previous season.
615	The remaining 8 games are split between the roster of two other NFL divisions.
615	This assignment shifts each year.
615	For instance, in the 2007 regular season, each team in the AFC West played one game against each team in both the AFC South and the NFC North.
615	In this way division competition consists of common opponents, with the exception of the 2 games assigned on the strength of each team's prior division standing.
615	AFC divisions that they are not scheduled to play) The NFC operates according to the same system.
615	At the end of each football season, there are playoff games involving the top six teams in the AFC (the four division champions by place standing and the top two remaining non-division-champion teams ("wild cards") by record).
615	The last two teams remaining play in the AFC Championship game with the winner receiving the Lamar Hunt Trophy.
615	The AFC champion plays the NFC champion in the Super Bowl.
615	After Super Bowl XLVI the AFC has won 19 Super Bowls to the 24 won by the NFC.
615	Since losing 13 consecutive Super Bowls in the 1980s and 1990s (XIX–XXXI), the AFC has won 9 of the last 15.
615	The coach of the team with the best record that lost in the AFC Divisional round is the coach of the Pro Bowl.
615	History The AFC was created after the NFL merged with the American Football League (AFL) in 1970.
615	All of the 10 former AFL teams along with the NFL's Cleveland Browns, Pittsburgh Steelers, and the then-Baltimore Colts joined the AFC.
615	The two AFL divisions  AFL East and AFL West were more or less intact.
615	Since the merger, five expansion teams have joined the AFC and two have left, thus making the current total 16.
615	When the Seattle Seahawks and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers joined the league in 1976, they were temporarily placed in the NFC and AFC respectively.
615	This arrangement lasted for one season only before the two teams switched conferences.
615	The Seahawks eventually returned to the NFC as a result of the 2002 realignment.
615	The expansion Jacksonville Jaguars joined the AFC in 1995.
615	Due to the relocation controversy of the Cleveland Browns, a new AFC franchise called the Baltimore Ravens was officially established in 1996 while the Browns were reactivated in 1999.
615	The Houston Texans were then added to the league in 2002, joining the AFC.
615	Between 2003 and 2012, the AFC had sent either the Indianapolis Colts, the New England Patriots, or the Pittsburgh Steelers to the Super Bowl, with two exceptions.
615	In the 2002 NFL season, the Oakland Raiders lost to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl XXXVII, and in the 2012 NFL season, the Baltimore Ravens prevailed over New England in the conference championship to reach Super Bowl XLVII.
615	By contrast, the NFC sent a different team each year save for the 2011 NFL season, when the New York Giants made it to their second Super Bowl in that same time span, Super Bowl XLVI.
615	Logo The merged league created a new logo for the AFC that took elements of the old AFL logo, specifically the "A" and the six stars surrounding it.
615	The AFC logo basically remained unchanged from 1970 to 2009.
615	The 2010 NFL season introduced an updated AFC logo, with the most notable revision being the removal of two sNFL seasontars (leaving four representing the four divisions of the AFC), and moving the stars inside the letter, similar to the NFC logo.
615	Notes
617	Al Gore
620	Animal Farm is an allegorical novel by George Orwell, published in England on 17 August 1945.
620	According to Orwell, the book reflects events leading up to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and then on into the Stalin era in the Soviet Union.
620	Orwell, a democratic socialist, was a critic of Joseph Stalin and hostile to Moscow-directed Stalinism, especially after his experiences with the NKVD and the Spanish Civil War.
620	The Soviet Union, he believed, had become a brutal dictatorship, built upon a cult of personality and enforced by a reign of terror.
620	In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described Animal Farm as his novel "contre Stalin" and in his essay "Why I Write" (1946) he wrote that Animal Farm was the first book in which he had tried, with full consciousness of what he was doing, "to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole".
620	The original title was Animal Farm: A Fairy Story, though the subtitle was dropped by U.S.
620	Orwell's lifetime omitted it.
620	Other variations in the title include: A Satire and A Contemporary Satire.
620	Orwell suggested the title Union des républiques socialistes animales for the French translation, which recalled the French name of the Soviet Union, Union des républiques socialistes soviétiques, and which abbreviates to URSA, the Latin for "bear", a symbol of Russia.
620	Orwell wrote the book from November 1943–February 1944 when the wartime alliance with the Soviet Union was at its height and Stalin was held in high esteem in Britain among the people and intelligentsia, a fact that Orwell hated.
620	It was initially rejected by a number of British and American publishers, including one of Orwell's own, Victor Gollancz.
620	Its publication was thus delayed, though it became a great commercial success when it did finally appear partly because the Cold War so quickly followed World War II.
620	Time magazine chose the book as one of the 100 best English-language novels (1923 to 2005); it also featured at number 31 on the Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels.
620	It won a Retrospective Hugo Award in 1996 and is also included in the Great Books of the Western World selection.
620	The novel addresses not only the corruption of the revolution by its leaders but also how wickedness, indifference, ignorance, greed, and myopia corrupt the revolution.
620	It portrays corrupt leadership as the flaw in revolution, rather than the act of revolution itself.
620	It also shows how potential ignorance and indifference to problems within a revolution could allow horrors to happen if a smooth transition to a people's government is not achieved.
620	Plot summary  Old Major, the old boar on the Manor Farm, calls the animals on the farm for a meeting, where he compares the humans to parasites and teaches the animals a revolutionary song, 'Beasts of England'.
620	When Major dies, two young pigs, Snowball and Napoleon, assume command and consider it a duty to prepare for the Rebellion.
620	The animals revolt and drive, assume comman the drunken and irresponsible Mr Jones from the farm, renaming it "Animal Farm".
620	They adopt Seven Commandments of Animalism, the most important of which is, "All animals are equal".
620	Snowball attempts to teach the animals reading and writing; food is plentiful, and the farm runs smoothly.
620	The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items, ostensibly for their personal health.
620	Napoleon takes the pups from the farm dogs and trains them privately.
620	Napoleon and Snowball struggle for leadership.
620	When Snowball announces his plans to build a windmill, Napoleon has his dogs chase Snowball away and declares himself leader.
620	Napoleon enacts changes to the governance structure of the farm, replacing meetings with a committee of pigs, who will run the farm.
620	Through a young pig named Squealer, Napoleon claims credit for the windmill idea.
620	The animals work harder with the promise of easier lives with the windmill.
620	When the animals find the windmill collapsed after a violent storm, Napoleon and Squealer convince the animals that Snowball destroyed it.
620	Once Snowball becomes a scapegoat, Napoleon begins purging the farm with his dogs, killing animals he accuses of consorting with his old rival.
620	Beasts of England' is replaced by an anthem glorifying Napoleon, who appears to be adopting the lifestyle of a man.
620	The animals remain convinced that they are better off than they were when under Mr Jones.
620	Mr Frederick, one of the neighbouring farmers, attacks the farm, using blasting powder to blow up the restored windmill.
620	Though the animals win the battle, they do so at great cost, as many, including Boxer the workhorse, are wounded.
620	Despite his injuries, Boxer continues working harder and harder, until he collapses while working on the windmill.
620	Napoleon sends for a van to take Boxer to the veterinary surgeon's, explaining that better care can be given there.
620	Benjamin, the cynical donkey, who "could read as well as any pig", notices that the van belongs to a knacker, and attempts a futile rescue.
620	Squealer reports that the van was purchased by the hospital and the writing from the previous owner had not been repainted.
620	He recounts a tale of Boxer's death in the hands of the best medical care.
620	Years pass, and the pigs learn to walk upright, carry whips, and wear clothes.
620	The Seven Commandments are reduced to a single phrase: "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others".
620	Napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and local farmers with whom he celebrates a new alliance.
620	He abolishes practices the revolutionary traditions and renames the farm "The Manor Farm".
620	The animals, overhearing the conversation, notice that the faces of the pigs have begun changing.
620	During a poker match, an argument breaks out between Napoleon and Mr Pilkington, and the animals realise that the faces of the pigs look like the faces of humans, and no one can tell the difference between them.
620	Characters  Pigs  *Old Major – An aged prize Middle White boar provides the inspiration that fuels the Rebellion in the book.
620	He is an allegorical combination of Karl Marx, one of the creators of communism, and Lenin, the communist leader of the Russian Revolution and the early Soviet nation, in that he draws up the principles of the revolution.
620	His skull being put on revered public display recalls Lenin, whose embalmed body was put on display.
620	Napoleon – "A large, rather fierce-looking Berkshire boar, the only Berkshire on the farm, not much of a talker, but with a reputation for getting his own way".
620	An allegory of Joseph Stalin, Napoleon is the main villain of Animal Farm.
620	In the first French version of Animal Farm, Napoleon is called ', the French form of Caesar, although another translation has him as '.
620	Snowball – Napoleon's rival and original head of the farm after Jones' overthrow.
620	He is mainly based on Leon Trotsky, but also combines elements from Lenin.
620	Squealer – A small white fat porker who serves as Napoleon's right hand pig and minister of propaganda, holding a position similar to that of Molotov.
620	Minimus – A poetic pig who writes the second and third national anthems of Animal Farm after the singing of "Beasts of England" is banned.
620	The Piglets – Hinted to be the children of Napoleon and are the first generation of animals subjugated to his idea of animal inequality.
620	The young pigs – Four pigs who complain about Napoleon's takeover of the farm but are quickly silenced and later executed.
620	Pinkeye – A minor pig who is mentioned only once; he is the pig that tastes Napoleon's food to make sure it is not poisoned, in response to rumours about an assassination attempt on Napoleon.
620	Humans  *Mr Jones – The former owner of the farm, Jones is a very heavy drinker.
620	The animals revolt against him after he drinks so much that he does not feed or take care of them.
620	Mr Frederick – The tough owner of Pinchfield, a small but well-kept neighbouring farm, who briefly enters into an alliance with Napoleon.
620	Mr Pilkington – The easy-going but crafty and well-to-do owner of Foxwood, a large neighbouring farm overgrown with weeds.
620	Mr Whymper – A man hired by Napoleon for the public relations of Animal Farm to human society.
620	At first he is used to acquire needed goods for the farm such as dog biscuits and paraffin, but later used to procure luxuries like alcohol for the pigs.
620	Equines  *Boxer – Boxer is a loyal, kind, dedicated, and respectable cart-horse, although quite naive and gullible.
620	Clover – Boxer's companion, constantly caring for him; she also acts as a matriarch of sorts for the other horses and the other animals in general.
620	Mollie – Mollie is a self-centred, self-indulgent and vain young white mare who quickly leaves for another farm after the revolution.
620	Benjamin – Benjamin, a donkey, is one of the oldest animals.
620	He has the worst temper, but is also one of the wisest animals on the farm, and is one of the few who can actually read.
620	He is sceptical and pessimistic, his most-often-made statement being "Life will go on as it has always gone on—that is, badly."
620	The academic Morris Dickstein has suggested there is ' a touch of Orwell himself in this creature's timeless scepticism' and indeed, friends called Orwell 'Donkey George', 'after his grumbling donkey Benjamin, in Animal Farm.'
620	Other animals  *Muriel – A wise old goat who is friends with all of the animals on the farm.
620	She, like Benjamin and Snowball, is one of the few animals on the farm who can read.
620	The Puppies – Offspring of Jessie and Bluebell, taken away from them by Napoleon at birth and reared by Napoleon to be his security force.
620	Moses – An old raven who occasionally visits the farm, regaling its denizens with tales of a wondrous place beyond the clouds called Sugarcandy Mohe farm, regaling its denizens with tales of a wonuntain, where he avers that all animals go when they die—but only if they work hard.
620	Orwell portrays religion as 'the black raven of priestcraft—promising pie in the sky when you die, and faithfully serving whoever happens to be in power.
620	The raven 'was Mr.
620	Jones's especial pet, was a spy and a tale-bearer, but he was also a clever talker.'
620	Napoleon brings the raven back, (Ch.
620	IX) as Stalin brought back the Russian Orthodox Church.
620	The Sheep – They show limited understanding of the situations but nonetheless blindly support Napoleon's ideals.
620	The Hens – The hens are among the first to rebel against Napoleon.
620	The Cows – Their milk is stolen by the pigs, who learn to milk them, and is stirred into the pigs' mash every day while the other animals are denied such luxuries.
620	The Cat – Never seen to carry out any work, the cat is absent for long periods, and is forgiven because her excuses are so convincing and she "purred so affectionately that it was impossible not to believe in her good intentions".
620	She has no interest in the politics of the farm, and the only time she is recorded as having participated in an election, she is found to have actually "voted on both sides".
620	Composition and Publication Origin  George Orwell wrote the manuscript in 1943 and 1944 subsequent to his experiences during the Spanish Civil War, which he described in Homage to Catalonia (1938).
620	In the preface of a 1947 Ukrainian edition of Animal Farm, he explained how escaping the communist purges in Spain taught him "how easily totalitarian propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in democratic countries".
620	This motivated Orwell to expose and strongly condemn what he saw as the Stalinist corruption of the original socialist ideals.
620	Immediately prior to his writing, Orwell had quit the BBC.
620	He was also upset about a booklet for propagandists the Ministry of Information had put out.
620	The booklet included instructions on how to quell ideological fears of the Soviet Union, which included directions to claim that the Red Terror was a figment of Nazi imagination.
620	In that preface, Orwell also described what gave him the idea of setting the book on a farm: Efforts to find a publisher  Orwell encountered great difficulty getting the manuscript published, as it was feared that the book might upset the alliance between the US, UK and the Soviet Union.
620	Four publishers refused; one had initially accepted the work but declined after consulting the Ministry of Information.
620	Eventually Secker and Warburg published the first edition in 1945.
620	During World War II, it became apparent to Orwell that anti-Soviet literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch — including his regular publisher Gollancz.
620	He also submitted the manuscript to Faber and Faber, where the poet T.
620	S.
620	Eliot (who was a director of the firm) rejected it; Eliot wrote back to Orwell praising its "good writing" and "fundamental integrity" but declared that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint "which I take to be generally Trotskyite".
620	Eliot said he found the view "not convincing", and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to run the farm; he posited that someone might argue "what was needed ..
620	".
620	Orwell let André Deutsch, who was working for Nicholson & Watson in 1944, read the typescript, and Deutsch was convinced that Nicholson & Watson would want to publish it - but they did not, and "lectured Orwell on what they perceived to be errors in Animal Farm."
620	In his London Letter, 17 April 1944 for Partisan Review Orwell wrote that it was "now next door to impossible to get anything overtly anti-Russian printed.
620	Anti-Russian books do appear, but mostly from Catholic publishing firms and always from a religious or frankly reactionary angle."
620	The publisher Jonathan Cape, who had initially accepted Animal Farm, subsequently rejected his book after an official at the British Ministry of Information warned him off — although the civil servant who it is assumed gave the order was later found to be a Soviet spy.
620	Writing to Leonard Moore, a partner in the literary agency of Christy & Moore, publisher Jonathan Cape explained that the decision had been taken on the advice of a senior official in the Ministry of Information.
620	Such flagrant anti-Soviet bias was unacceptable: and the choice of pigs as the dominant class was thought to be especially offensive.
620	The 'important official' was, or so it may reasonably be assumed, a man named Peter Smollett, later unmasked as a Soviet agent.
620	Orwell was suspicious of Smollett/Smolka and he would be one of the names Orwell included in his list of Crypto-Communists and Fellow-Travellers sent to the Information Research Department in 1949.
620	Born Hans Peter Smolka in Vienna in 1912 he came to Britain in 1933 as an NKVD agent, codename 'Abo', became a naturalized British subject in 1938, changed his name, and after the outbreak of World War II joined the Ministry of Information where he organised pro-Soviet propaganda—he worked with Kim Philby in 1943-45.
620	Smollett's family have rejected the accusation that he was a spy.
620	The publisher wrote to Orwell, saying: Frederic Warburg too, faced pressures against publication, even from people in his own office, and from his wife Pamela, who felt that it was not the moment for ingratitude towards Stalin and the heroic Red Army]amela, who felt that it was ] who had played a major part in defeating Hitler.
620	A Russian translation was printed in the paper Posev, and in giving permission for a Russian translation of Animal Farm Orwell refused in advance all royalties.
620	A translation in Ukrainian, produced in Germany, was confiscated in large part by the American wartime authorities and handed over to the Soviet repatriation commission.
620	In October 1945 Orwell wrote to Fredric Warburg expressing interest in pursuing the chances that the political cartoonist David Low would illustrate Animal Farm.
620	Low had written a letter saying that he had had "a good time with ANIMAL FARM - an excellent bit of satire - it would illustrate perfectly."
620	Nothing came of this but an edition illustrated by the cartoonist Ralph Steadman was published by Secker & Warburg in 1995 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the first edition of Animal Farm  in 1945.
620	"The Freedom of the Press"  Orwell originally wrote a preface which complains about British self-censorship and how the British people were suppressing criticism of the USSR, their World War II ally.
620	"The sinister fact about literary censorship in England is that it is largely voluntary....
620	Things are kept right out of the British press, not because the Government intervenes but because of a general tacit agreement that 'it wouldn't do' to mention that particular fact."
620	Although the first edition allowed space for the preface, it was not included, and as of June 2009 has not been published with most editions of the book.
620	Secker and Warburg published the first edition of Animal Farm in 1945 without any introduction.
620	However, the publisher had provided space for a preface in the author's proof composited from the manuscript.
620	For reasons unknown, no preface was supplied and all the page numbers needed to be redone at the last minute.
620	Years later, in 1972, Ian Angus found the original typescript titled "The Freedom of the Press", and Bernard Crick published it, together with his own introduction in The Times Literary Supplement on 15 September 1972 as "How the essay came to be written".
620	Orwell's essay criticised British self-censorship by the press, specifically the suppression of unflattering descriptions of Stalin and the Soviet government.
620	The same essay also appeared in the Italian 1976 Animal Farm edition, with another introduction by Crick, claiming to be the first edition with the preface.
620	Other publishers were still declining to publish it.
620	Critical Response  Contemporary reviews of the work were not universally positive.
620	Writing in the American New Republic magazine, George Soule expressed his disappointment in the book, writing it "puzzled and saddened me.
620	It seemed on the whole dull.
620	The allegory turned out to be a creaking machine for saying in a clumsy way things that have been said better directly."
620	Soule argued that the animals were not consistent enough to their real world inspirations, and said, "It seems to me that the failure of this book (commercially it is already assured of tremendous success) arises from the fact that the satire deals not with something the author has experienced, but rather with stereotyped ideas about a country which he probably does not know very well.
620	Tosco Fyvel, writing in Tribune, 24 August 1945, called the book " a gentle satire on a certain State and on the illusions of an age which may already be behind us."
620	Julian Symons responded to this on 7 September - "Should we not expect, in Tribune at least, acknowledgement of the fact that it is a satire not at all gentle upon a particular State - Soviet Russia?
620	It seems to me that a reviewer should have the courage to identify Napoleon with Stalin, and Snowball with Trotsky, and express an opinion favourable or unfavourable to the author, upon a political ground.
620	In a hundred years time perhaps, Animal Farm may be simply a fairy story, today it is a political satire with a good deal of point."
620	Animal Farm has been subject to much comment in the decades since these early remarks.
620	Analysis Animalism The pigs Snowball, Napoleon, and Squealer adapt Old Major's ideas into 'a complete system of thought', which they formally name Animalism.
620	Soon after, Napoleon and Squealer indulge in the vices of humans (drinking alcohol, sleeping in beds, trading).
620	Squealer is employed to alter the Seven Commandments to account for this humanisation, an allusion to the Soviet government's revising of history in order to exercise control of the people's beliefs about themselves and their society.
620	The original commandments are: # Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.
620	Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.
620	No animal shall wear clothes.
620	No animal shall sleep in a bed.
620	No animal shall drink alcohol.
620	No animal shall kill any other animal.
620	All animals are equal.
620	Later, Napoleon and his pigs secretly revise some commandments to clear them of accusations of law-breaking (such as "No animal shall drink alcohol" having "to excess" appended to it and "No animal shall sleep in a bed" with "with sheets" added to it).
620	The changed commandments are as follows, with the changes bolded: * 4 No animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets.
620	No animal shall drink alcohol to excess.
620	No animal shall kill any other animal without cause.
620	Eventually these are replaced with the maxims, "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others", and "Four legs good, two legs better!"
620	This is an ironic twist to the original purpose of the Seven Commandments, which were supposed to keep order within Animal Farm by uniting the animals together against the humans, and prevent animals from following the humans' evil habits.
620	Through the revision of the commandments, Orwell demonstrates how simply political dogma can be turned into malleable propaganda.
620	Significance and allegory In the Eastern Bloc both Animal Farm and later, also Nineteen Eighty-Four were on the list of forbidden books up until the end of communism in 1989, and were only available via clandestine Samizdat networks.
620	Orwell biographer Jeffrey Meyers has written, "virtually every detail has political significance in this grapher Jeffallegory."
620	Orwell himself wrote in 1946, "Of course I intended it primarily as a satire on the Russian revolution..[and] that kind of revolution (violent conspiratorial revolution, led by unconsciously power hungry people) can only lead to a change of masters [-] revolutions only effect a radical improvement when the masses are alert."
620	And in a preface for a 1947 Ukrainian edition he stated, "...
620	I have been convinced that the destruction of the Soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement.
620	On my return from Spain [in 1937] I thought of exposing the Soviet myth in a story that could be easily understood by almost anyone and which could be easily translated into other languages."
620	The revolt of the animals against Farmer Jones is Orwell's analogy with the October 1917 Bolshevik Revolution and Jones's attempt to regain control, with the aid of neighbouring farmers, parallels the Western powers' efforts 1918-21 to crush the Bolsheviks.
620	The pigs' rise to pre-eminence mirrors the rise of a Stalinist bureaucracy in the USSR, just as Napoleon's emergence as the farm's sole leader reflects Stalin's emergence.
620	The pigs' appropriation of milk and apples for their own use, "the turning point of the story" as Orwell termed it in a letter to Dwight Macdonald, stands as an analogy for the crushing of the left-wing 1921 Kronstadt revolt against the Bolsheviks, and the difficult efforts of the animals to build the windmill bring to mind the various Five Year Plans.
620	The puppies controlled by Napoleon parallel the nurture of the secret police in the Stalinist structure and the pigs' treatment of the other animals on the farm recalls the internal terror faced by the populace in the 1930s.
620	In chapter seven when the animals confess their nonexistent crimes, and are killed, Orwell directly alludes to the purges, confessions and show trials of the late 1930s.
620	These contributed to Orwell's conviction that the Bolshevik revolution had been corrupted and the Soviet system become rotten.
620	Peter Edgerly Firchow and Peter Hobley Davison consider that in real life, with events in Animal Farm mirroring those in the Soviet Union, the Battle of the Windmill represents the Great Patriotic War (World War II), especially the Battle of Stalingrad and the Battle of Moscow.
620	During the battle, Fredrick drills a hole and places explosives inside, and this was followed by "All the animals, including Napoleon" took cover; Orwell had the publisher alter this to "All the animals except Napoleon" in recognition of Joseph Stalin's decision to remain in Moscow during the German advance.
620	This very particular alteration had been occasioned by Orwell having been in Paris in March 1945, working as a war correspondent for the Observer and the Manchester Evening News.
620	In Paris he met Joseph Czapski, a survivor of the Katyn Massacre.
620	In spite of Czapski's opposition to the Soviet regime, he told Orwell, as Orwell wrote to Arthur Koestler, that it had been 'the character [and] greatness of Stalin' that saved Russia from the German invasion.
620	The Battle of the Cowshed represents the allied invasion of the Soviet Russia in 1918, and the defeat of the White Russians in the Russian Civil War.
620	Other connections that writers on Orwell have suggested illustrate Orwell's telescoping of Russian history from 1917 to 1943 include the wave of rebelliousness that ran through the countryside after the Rebellion, which stands for the abortive revolutions in Hungary and Germany (Ch IV); the conflict between Napoleon and Snowball (ChV), paralleling "the two rival and quasi-Messianic beliefs that seemed pitted against one another: Trotskyism, with its faith in the revolutionary vocation of the proletariat of the West; and Stalinism with its glorification of Russia's socialist destiny"; Napoleon's dealings with Whymper and the Willingdon markets (Ch VI), paralleling the Treaty of Rapallo; and Frederick's bank notes, paralleling the Hitler-Stalin non-aggression pact of August 1939, which are forgeries.
620	Frederick attacks Animal Farm without warning and destroys the windmill.
620	The book's close, with the pigs and men in a kind of rapprochement, reflected Orwell's view of the 1943 Teheran Conference that seemed to display the establishment of "the best possible relations between the USSR and the West"—but in reality were destined, as Orwell presciently predicted, to continue to unravel.
620	The disagreement between the allies and the start of the Cold War is suggested when Napoleon and Pilkington, both suspicious, "played an ace of spades simultaneously".
620	Cultural references  References to the novella are frequent in other works of popular culture, particularly in popular music and television series.
620	Adaptations  A BBC radio version, produced by Rayner Heppenstall, was broadcast in January 1947.
620	Orwell listened to the production at his home in Canonbury Square in London, with Hugh Gordon Porteous, amongst others.
620	Orwell later wrote to Heppenstall that Porteous, 'who had not read the book, grasped what was happening after a few minutes.'
620	A further radio production, again using Orwells own dramatisation of the book, was broadcast in January 2013 on BBC Radio Four.
620	Tamsin Greig] own dramatisation of the book, was broadc] narrated and the cast included Nicky Henson as Napoleon, Toby Jones as the propagandist Squealer, and Ralph Ineson as Boxer.
620	Animal Farm has been adapted to film twice, with a third version to potentially follow in 2012.
620	The 1954 Animal Farm film was an animated feature and the 1999 Animal Farm film was a TV live action version.
620	Both differ from the novel, and have been accused of taking significant liberties, sanitising some aspects.
620	In the 1954 version, Napoleon is apparently overthrown in a second revolution.
620	The 1999 film shows Napoleon's regime collapsing in on itself, with the farm with new human owners, as happened in the Soviet Union, appropriating the new political reality to the story.
620	In 2012, a HFR-3D version of Animal Farm potentially directed by Andy Serkis was announced.
620	A theatrical version, with music and lyrics, the songs by Adrian Mitchell, was staged at the National Theatre London on 25 April 1984, directed by Peter Hall.
620	It toured nine cities in 1985.
620	A solo version, adapted and performed by Guy Masterson premièred at the Traverse Theatre Edinburgh, January 1995 and has toured worldwide since.

621	Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia.
621	They inhabit a wide variety of habitats with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems.
621	Amphibians typically start out as larva living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this.
621	The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs.
621	Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely upon skin.
621	They are superficially similar to reptiles but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed.
621	With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators and in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe.
621	The earliest amphibians evolved in the Devonian Period from sarcopterygian fish with lungs and bony-limbed fins, features that were helpful in adapting to dry land.
621	They diversified and became dominant during the Carboniferous and Permian periods, but were later displaced by reptiles and other vertebrates.
621	Over time, amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity, leaving only the modern subclass Lissamphibia.
621	The three modern orders of amphibians are Anura (the frogs and toads), Caudata/Urodela (the salamanders), and Gymnophiona/Apoda (the caecilians).
621	The total number of known amphibian species is approximately 7,000, of which nearly 90% are frogs.
621	The smallest amphibian (and vertebrate) in the world is a frog from New Guinea (Paedophryne amauensis) with a length of just .
621	The largest living amphibian is the  Chinese Giant Salamander (Andrias davidianus) but this is dwarfed by the extinct 9 m Prionosuchus from the middle Permian of Brazil.
621	The study of amphibians is called batrachology, while the study of both reptiles and amphibians is called herpetology.
621	Evolution  The first major groups of amphibians developed in the Devonian period, around 370 million years ago, from lobe-finned fish similar to the modern coelacanth and lungfish, which had evolved multi-jointed leg-like fins with digits that enabled them to crawl along the sea bottom.
621	Some fish had developed primitive lungs to help them breathe air when the stagnant pools of the Devonian swamps were low in oxygen.
621	They could also use their strong fins to hoist themselves out of the water and onto dry land if circumstances so required.
621	Eventually, their bony fins would evolve into limbs and they would become the ancestors to all tetrapods, including modern amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.
621	Despite being able to crawl on land, many of these prehistoric tetrapodomorph fish still spent most of their time in the water.
621	They had started to develop lungs, but still breathed predominantly with gills.
621	Ichthyostega was one of the first primitive amphibians, with nostrils and more efficient lungs.
621	It had four sturdy limbs, a neck, a tail with fins and a skull very similar to that of the lobe-finned fish, Eusthenopteron.
621	Amphibians evolved adaptations that allowed them to stay out of the water for longer periods.
621	Their lungs improved and their skeletons became heavier and stronger, better able to cope with the increased gravitational effect of life on land.
621	They developed "hands" and "feet" with five or more digits; the skin became more capable of retaining body fluids and resisting desiccation.
621	The fish's hyomandibula bone in the hyoid region behind the gills diminished in size and became the stapes of the amphibian ear, an adaptation necessary for hearing on dry land.
621	An affinity between the amphibians and the teleost fish is the multi-folded structure of the teeth and the paired supra-occipital bones at the back of the head, neither of these features being found elsewhere in the animal kingdom.
621	At the end of the Devonian period (360 million years ago), the seas, rivers and lakes were teeming with life while the land was the realm of early plants and devoid of vertebrates, though some, such as Ichthyostega, may have sometimes hauled themselves out of the water.
621	It is thought they may have propelled themselves with their forelimbs, dragging their hindquarters in a similar manner to that used by the elephant seal.
621	In the early Carboniferous (360 to 345 million years ago), the climate became wet and warm.
621	Extensive swamps developed with mosses, ferns, horsetails and calamites.
621	Air-breathing arthropods evolved and invaded the land where they provided food for the carnivorous amphibians that began to adapt to the terrestrial environment.
621	There were no other tetrapods on the land and the am began to adapt to thephibians were at the top of the food chain, occupying the ecological position currently held by the crocodile.
621	Though equipped with limbs and the ability to breathe air, most still had a long tapering body and strong tail.
621	They were the top land predators, sometimes reaching several metres in length, preying on the large insects of the period and the many types of fish in the water.
621	They still needed to return to water to lay their shell-less eggs, and even most modern amphibians have a fully aquatic larval stage with gills like their fish ancestors.
621	It was the development of the amniotic egg, which prevents the developing embryo from drying out, that enabled the reptiles to reproduce on land and which led to their dominance in the period that followed.
621	During the Triassic Period (250 to 200 million years ago), the reptiles began to out-compete the amphibians, leading to a reduction in both the amphibians' size and their importance in the biosphere.
621	According to the fossil record, Lissamphibia, which includes all modern amphibians and is the only surviving lineage, may have branched off from the extinct groups Temnospondyli and Lepospondyli at some period between the Late Carboniferous and the Early Triassic.
621	The relative scarcity of fossil evidence precludes precise dating, but the most recent molecular study, based on multilocus sequence typing, suggests a Late Carboniferous/Early Permian origin of extant amphibians.
621	The origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians is a matter of debate.
621	A 2005 molecular phylogeny, based on rDNA analysis, suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs.
621	It also appears that the divergence of the three groups took place in the Paleozoic or early Mesozoic (around 250 million years ago), before the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea and soon after their divergence from the lobe-finned fish.
621	The briefness of this period, and the swiftness with which radiation took place, would help account for the relative scarcity of primitive amphibian fossils.
621	There are large gaps in the fossil record, but the discovery of a proto-frog from the Early Permian in Texas in 2008 provided a missing link with many of the characteristics of modern frogs.
621	Molecular analysis suggests that the frog–salamander divergence took place considerably earlier than the palaeontological evidence indicates.
621	As they evolved from lunged fish, amphibians had to make certain adaptations for living on land including the need to develop new means of locomotion.
621	In the water, the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward but on land, quite different mechanisms were required.
621	Their vertebral columns, limbs, limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding.
621	Terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of air.
621	They needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature.
621	They developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment.
621	Their skins were exposed to harmful ultraviolet rays that had previously been absorbed by the water.
621	The skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss.
621	Classification  The word "Amphibian" is derived from the Ancient Greek term ἀμφίβιος (amphíbios), which means "both kinds of life", ἀμφί meaning "of both kinds" and βιος meaning "life".
621	The term was initially used as a general adjective for animals that could live on land or in water, including seals and otters.
621	Traditionally, the class Amphibia includes all tetrapod vertebrates that are not amniotes.
621	Amphibia in its widest sense (sensu lato) was divided into three subclasses, two of which are extinct: * Subclass Labyrinthodontia† (diverse Paleozoic and early Mesozoic group) * Subclass Lepospondyli† (small Paleozoic group, sometimes included in the Labyrinthodontia, which may actually be more closely related to amniotes than Lissamphibia) * Subclass Lissamphibia (all modern amphibians, including frogs, toads, salamanders, newts and caecilians) ** Order Anura (frogs and toads): Jurassic to present—5,602 current species in 48 families ** Order Caudata or Urodela (salamanders, newts): Jurassic to present—571 current species in 10 families ** Order Gymnophiona or Apoda (caecilians): Jurassic to present—190 current species in 10 families The actual number of species in each group depends on the taxonomic classification followed.
621	The two most common systems are the classification adopted by the website AmphibiaWeb, University of California (Berkeley) and the classification by herpetologist Darrel Frost and the American Museum of Natural History, available as the online reference database Amphibian Species of the World.
621	The numbers of species cited above follow Frost and the total number of known amphibian species is approximately 7,000, of which nearly 90% are frogs.
621	With the phylogenetic classification, the taxon 1188_chapter1.pdf }} With the paraphyletic group without unique defining features apart from shared primitive characteristics.
621	Classification varies according to the preferred phylogeny of the author and whether they use a stem-based or a node-based classification.
621	Traditionally, amphibians as a class are defined as all tetrapods with a larval stage, while the group that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians (frogs, salamanders and caecilians) and all their descendants is called Lissamphibia.
621	The phylogeny of Paleozoic amphibians is uncertain, and Lissamphibia may possibly fall within extinct groups, like the Temnospondyli (traditionally placed in the subclass Labyrinthodontia) or the Lepospondyli, and in some analyses even in the amniotes.
621	This means that advocates of phylogenetic nomenclature have removed a large number of basal Devonian and Carboniferous amphibian-type tetrapod groups that were formerly placed in Amphibia in Linnaean taxonomy, and included them elsewhere under cladistic taxonomy.
621	If the common ancestor of amphibians and amniotes is included in Amphibia, it becomes a paraphyletic group.
621	All modern amphibians are included in the subclass Lissamphibia, which is usually considered a clade, a group of species that have evolved from a common ancestor.
621	The three modern orders are Anura (the frogs and toads), Caudata (or Urodela, the salamanders), and Gymnophiona (or Apoda, the caecilians).
621	It has been suggested that salamanders arose separately from a Temnospondyl-like ancestor, and even that caecilians are the sister group of the advanced reptiliomorph amphibians, and thus of amniotes.
621	Although the fossils of several older proto-frogs with primitive characteristics are known, the oldest "true frog" is Prosalirus bitis, from the Early Jurassic Kayenta Formation of Arizona.
621	It is anatomically very similar to modern frogs.
621	The oldest known caecilian is another Early Jurassic species, Eocaecilia micropodia and is also from Arizona.
621	The earliest salamander is Beiyanerpeton jianpingensis from the Late Jurassic of northeastern China.
621	Authorities disagree as to whether Salientia is a superorder that includes the order Anura, or whether Anura is a sub-order of the order Salientia.
621	The Lissamphibia are traditionally divided into three orders, but an extinct salamander-like family, the Albanerpetontidae, is now considered part of the Lissamphibia alongside the superorder Salientia.
621	Furthermore, Salientia includes all three recent orders plus the Triassic proto-frog, Triadobatrachus.
621	Characteristics  The superclass Tetrapoda is divided into four classes of vertebrate animals with four limbs.
621	Reptiles, birds and mammals are amniotes, the eggs of which are either laid or carried by the female and are surrounded by several membranes, some of which are impervious.
621	Lacking these membranes, amphibians require water bodies for reproduction, although some species have developed various strategies for protecting or bypassing the vulnerable aquatic larval stage.
621	They are not found in the sea with the exception of one or two frogs that live in brackish water in mangrove swamps.
621	On land, amphibians are restricted to moist habitats because of the need to keep their skin damp.
621	The smallest amphibian (and vertebrate) in the world is a microhylid frog from New Guinea (Paedophryne amauensis) first discovered in 2012.
621	It has an average length of  and is part of a genus which contains four of the world's ten smallest frog species.
621	The largest living amphibian is the  Chinese Giant Salamander (Andrias davidianus) but this is a great deal smaller than the largest amphibian that ever existed—the extinct 9 m Prionosuchus, a crocodile-like temnospondyl dating to 270 million years ago from the middle Permian of Brazil.
621	The largest frog is the African Goliath frog (Conraua goliath) which can reach 32 cm and weigh 3 kg.
621	Frogs range in size from the 30 cm goliath frog (Conraua goliath) of West Africa to the  Paedophryne amauensis, first described in Papua New Guinea in 2012, which is also the smallest known vertebrate.
621	Although most species are associated with water and damp habitats, some are specialised to live in trees or in deserts.
621	They are found worldwide except for polar areas.
621	Anura is divided into three suborders that are broadly accepted by the scientific community, but the relationships between some families remain unclear.
621	Future molecular studies should provide further insights into their evolutionary relationships.
621	The suborder Archaeobatrachia contains four families of primitive frogs.
621	These are Ascaphidae, Bombinatoridae, Discoglossidae and Leiopelmatidae which have few derived features and are probably paraphyletic with regard to other frog lineages.
621	The six families in the more evolutionarily advanced suborder Mesobatrachia consist of the fossorial Megophryidae, Pelobatidae, Pelodytidae, Scaphiopodidae and Rhinophrynidae and the obligatorily aquatic Pipidae.
621	These have certain characteristics that are intermediate between the two other suborders.
621	Neobatrachia is by far the largest suborder and includes the remaining families of modern frogs, including most common species.
621	Caudata  The order Caudata (from the Latin cauda meaning "tail") consists of the salamanders—elongated, low-slung animals that mostly resemble lizards in form.
621	This is a symplesiomorphic trait and they are no more closely related to lizards than they are to mammals.
621	Salamanders lack claws, have scale-free skins, either smooth or covered with tubercles, and tails that are usually flattened from side to side and often finned.
621	They range in size from the Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus), which has been reported to grow to a length of , to the diminutive Thorius pennatulus from Mexico which seldom exceeds 20 mm in length.
621	Salamanders are distributed widely in the Holarctic region of the northern hemisphere.
621	The family Plethodontidae is also found in Central America and South America north of the Amazon Basin.
621	Urodela is a name sometimes used for all the extant species of sallins" />amanders.
621	Members of several families of salamanders have become paedomorphic and either fail to complete their metamorphosis or retain some larval characteristics as adults.
621	Most salamanders are under 15 cm long.
621	They may be terrestrial or aquatic and many spend part of the year in each habitat.
621	When on land, they mostly spend the day hidden under stones or logs or in dense vegetation, emerging in the evening and night to forage for worms, insects and other invertebrates.
621	The suborder Cryptobranchoidea contains the primitive salamanders.
621	A number of fossil cryptobranchids have been found, but there are only three living species, the Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus), the Japanese giant salamander (Andrias japonicus) and the hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis) from North America.
621	These large amphibians retain several larval characteristics in their adult state; gills slits are present and the eyes are unlidded.
621	A unique feature is their ability to feed by suction, depressing either the left side of their lower jaw or the right.
621	The males excavate nests, persuade females to lay their egg strings inside them, and guard them.
621	As well as breathing with lungs, they respire through the many folds in their thin skin, which has capillaries close to the surface.
621	The suborder Salamandroidea contains the advanced salamanders.
621	They differ from the cryptobranchids by having fused prearticular bones in the lower jaw, and by using internal fertilisation.
621	In salamandrids, the male deposits a bundle of sperm, the spermatophore, and the female picks it up and inserts it into her cloaca where the sperm is stored until the eggs are laid.
621	The largest family in this group is Plethodontidae, the lungless salamanders, which includes 60% of all salamander species.
621	The family Salamandridae includes the true salamanders and the name "newt" is given to members of its subfamily Pleurodelinae.
621	The third suborder, Sirenoidea, contains the four species of sirens, which are in a single family, Sirenidae.
621	Members of this order are eel-like aquatic salamanders with much reduced forelimbs and no hind limbs.
621	Some of their features are primitive while others are derived.
621	Fertilisation is likely to be external as sirenids lack the cloacal glands used by male salamandrids to produce spermatophores and the females lack spermathecae for sperm storage.
621	Despite this, the eggs are laid singly, a behaviour not conducive for external fertilisation.
621	Gymnophiona  The order Gymnophiona (from the Greek gymnos meaning "naked" and ophis meaning "serpent") or Apoda (from the Latin an- meaning "without" and the Greek poda meaning "legs") comprise the caecilians.
621	These are long, cylindrical, limbless animals with a snake- or worm-like form.
621	The adults vary in length from 8 to 75 centimetres (3 to 30 inches) with the exception of Thomson's caecilian (Caecilia thompsoni) which can reach 150 centimetres (5 feet).
621	A caecilian's skin has a large number of transverse folds and in some species contains tiny embedded dermal scales.
621	It has rudimentary eyes covered in skin, which are probably limited to discerning differences in light intensity.
621	It also has a pair of short tentacles near the eye that can be extended and which have tactile and olfactory functions.
621	Most caecilians live underground in burrows in damp soil, in rotten wood and under plant debris, but some are aquatic.
621	Most species lay their eggs underground and when the larvae hatch, they make their way to adjacent bodies of water.
621	Others brood their eggs and the larvae undergo metamorphosis before the eggs hatch.
621	A few species give birth to live young, nourishing them with glandular secretions while they are in the oviduct.
621	Caecilians are found in tropical Africa, Asia and Central and South America.
621	Anatomy and physiology  Skin  The integumentary structure contains some typical characteristics common to terrestrial vertebrates, such as the presence of highly cornified outer layers, renewed periodically through a moulting process controlled by the pituitary and thyroid glands.
621	Local thickenings (often called warts) are common, such as those found on toads.
621	The outside of the skin is shed periodically more or less in one piece, in contrast to mammals and birds where it is shed in flakes.
621	Amphibians often eat the sloughed skin.
621	Caecilians are unique among amphibians in having mineralized dermal scales embedded in the dermis between the furrows in the skin.
621	The similarity of these to the scales of bony fish is largely superficial.
621	Lizards and some frogs have somewhat similar osteoderms forming bony deposits in the dermis, but this is an example of convergent evolution with similar structures having arisen independently in diverse vertebrate lineages.
621	Amphibian skin is permeable to water.
621	Gas exchange can take place through the skin and this allows adult amphibians to respire without risias exchange can takng to the surface of water and to hibernate at the bottom of ponds.
621	To compensate for their thin and delicate skin, amphibians have evolved mucous glands, principally on their heads, backs and tails.
621	The secretions produced by these help keep the skin moist.
621	In addition, most species of amphibian have granular glands that secrete distasteful or poisonous substances.
621	Some amphibian toxins can be lethal to humans while others have little effect.
621	The main poison-producing glands, the paratoids, produce the neurotoxin bufotoxin and are located behind the ears of toads, along the backs of frogs, behind the eyes of salamanders and on the upper surface of caecilians.
621	The skin colour of amphibians is produced by three layers of pigment cells called chromatophores.
621	These three cell layers consist of the melanophores (occupying the deepest layer), the guanophores (forming an intermediate layer and containing many granules, producing a blue-green colour) and the lipophores (yellow, the most superficial layer).
621	The colour change displayed by many species is initiated by hormones secreted by the pituitary gland.
621	Unlike bony fish, there is no direct control of the pigment cells by the nervous system, and this results in the colour change taking place more slowly than happens in fish.
621	A vividly coloured skin usually indicates that the species is toxic and is a warning sign to predators.
621	Skeletal system and locomotion  Amphibians have a skeletal system that is structurally homologous to other tetrapods, though with a number of variations.
621	They all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs.
621	The bones are hollow and lightweight.
621	The musculoskeletal system is strong to enable it to support the head and body.
621	The bones are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes.
621	The pectoral girdle is supported by muscle, and the well-developed pelvic girdle is attached to the backbone by a pair of sacral ribs.
621	The ilium slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals.
621	In most amphibians, there are four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot, but no claws on either.
621	Some salamanders have fewer digits and the Amphiumas are eel-like in appearance with tiny, stubby legs.
621	The sirens are aquatic salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind limbs.
621	The caecilians are limbless.
621	They burrow in the manner of earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body.
621	On the surface of the ground or in water they move by undulating their body from side to side.
621	In frogs, the hind legs are larger than the fore legs, especially so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming.
621	In the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large, and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies.
621	The feet have adaptations for the way of life, with webbing between the toes for swimming, broad adhesive toe pads for climbing, and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging (frogs usually dig backwards into the soil).
621	In most salamanders, the limbs are short and more or less the same length and project at right angles from the body.
621	Locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings from side to side or is used as a prop, particularly when climbing.
621	In their normal gait, only one leg is advanced at a time in the manner adopted by their ancestors, the lobe-finned fish.
621	Some salamanders in the genus Aneides and certain Plethodontids climb trees and have long limbs, large toepads and prehensile tails.
621	In aquatic salamanders and in frog tadpoles, the tail has dorsal and ventral fins and is moved from side to side as a means of propulsion.
621	Adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones.
621	Salamanders use their tails in defence and some are prepared to jettison them to save their lives in a process known as autotomy.
621	Certain species in the Plethodontidae have a weak zone at the base of the tail and use this strategy readily.
621	The tail often continues to twitch after separation which may distract the attacker and allow the salamander to escape.
621	Both tails and limbs can be regenerated.
621	Adult frogs are unable to regrow limbs but tadpoles can do so.
621	Circulatory system  Amphibians have a juvenile stage and an adult stage, and the circulatory systems of the two are distinct.
621	In the juvenile (or tadpole) stage, the circulation is similar to that of a fish; the two-chambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated, round the body and back to the heart in a single loop.
621	In the adult stage, amphibians (especially frogs) lose their gills and develop lungs.
621	They have a heart that consists of a single ventricle and two atria.
621	When the ventricle starts contracting, deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs.
621	Continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood round the rest of the body.
621	Mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers.
621	Nervous and sensory systems  The nervous system is basically the same as in other vertebrates, with a central brain, a spinal cord, and nerves throughout the body.
621	The amphibian brain is less well developed than that of reptiles, birds and mammals but is similar in morphology and function to that of a fish.
621	It consists of equal parts cerebrum, midbrain and cerebellum.
621	Various parts of the cerebrum process sensory input, such as smell in the olfactory lobe and sight in the optic lobe, and it is additionally the centre of behaviour and learning.
621	The cerebellum is the centre of muscular coordination and the medulla oblongata controls some organ functions including heartbeat and respiration.
621	The brain sends signals through the spinal cord and nerves to regulate activity in the rest of the body.
621	The pineal body, known to regulate sleep patterns in humans, is thought to produce the hormones involved in hibernation and aestivation in amphibians.
621	Tadpoles retain the lateral line system of their ancestral fishes but this is lost in terrestrial adult amphibians.
621	Some caecilians possess electroreceptors that allow them to locate objects aroundme caecili them when submerged in water.
621	The ears are well developed in frogs.
621	There is no external ear, but the large circular eardrum lies on the surface of the head just behind the eye.
621	This vibrates and sound is transmitted through a single bone, the stapes, to the inner ear.
621	Only high frequency sounds like mating calls are heard in this way but low frequency noises can be detected through another mechanism.
621	There is a patch of specialized haircells, called papilla amphibiorum, in the inner ear capable of detecting deeper sounds.
621	Another feature, unique to frogs and salamanders, is the columella-operculum complex adjoining the auditory capsule which is involved in the transmission of both airborne and seismic signals.
621	The ears of salamanders and caecilians are less highly developed than those of frogs as they do not normally communicate with each other through the medium of sound.
621	The eyes of tadpoles lack lids but at metamorphosis, the cornea becomes more dome-shaped, the lens becomes flatter, and eyelids and associated glands and ducts develop.
621	The adult eyes are an improvement on invertebrate eyes and were a first step in the development of more advanced vertebrate eyes.
621	They allow colour vision and depth of focus.
621	In the retinas are green rods, which are receptive to a wide range of wavelengths.
621	Digestive and excretory systems  Many amphibians catch their prey by flicking out an elongated tongue with a sticky tip and drawing it back into the mouth before seizing the item with their jaws.
621	Some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey, repeatedly thrusting their head forward sharply causing the food to move backwards in their mouth by inertia.
621	Most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing so they possess voluminous stomachs.
621	The short oesophagus is lined with cilia that help to move the food to the stomach and mucus produced by glands in the mouth and pharynx eases its passage.
621	The enzyme chitinase produced in the stomach helps digest the chitinous cuticle of arthropod prey.
621	Amphibians possess a pancreas, liver and gall bladder.
621	The liver is usually large with two lobes.
621	Its size is determined by its function as a glycogen and fat storage unit, and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up.
621	Adipose tissue is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen, under the skin and, in some salamanders, in the tail.
621	There are two kidneys located dorsally, near the roof of the body cavity.
621	Their job is to filter the blood of metabolic waste and transport the urine via ureters to the urinary bladder where it is stored before being passed out periodically through the cloacal vent.
621	Larvae and most aquatic adult amphibians excrete the nitrogen as ammonia in large quantities of dilute urine, while terrestrial species, with a greater need to conserve water, excrete the less toxic product urea.
621	Some tree frogs with limited access to water excrete most of their metabolic waste as uric acid.
621	Respiratory system  The lungs in amphibians are primitive compared to those of amniotes, possessing few internal septa and large alveoli, and consequently having a comparatively slow diffusion rate for oxygen entering the blood.
621	Ventilation is accomplished by buccal pumping.
621	Most amphibians, however, are able to exchange gases with the water or air via their skin.
621	To enable sufficient cutaneous respiration, the surface of their highly vascularized skin must remain moist to allow the oxygen to diffuse at a sufficiently high rate.
621	Because oxygen concentration in the water increases at both low temperatures and high flow rates, aquatic amphibians in these situations can rely primarily on cutaneous respiration, as in the Titicaca water frog and the hellbender salamander.
621	In air, where oxygen is more concentrated, some small species can rely solely on cutaneous gas exchange, most famously the plethodontid salamanders, which have neither lungs nor gills.
621	Many aquatic salamanders and all tadpoles have gills in their larval stage, with some (such as the axolotl) retaining gills as aquatic adults.
621	Reproduction  For the purpose of reproduction most amphibians require fresh water although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means of keeping them moist.
621	A few (e.g.
621	Fejervarya raja) can inhabit brackish water but there are no true marine amphibians.
621	There are reports however of particular amphibian populations unexpectedly invading marine waters.
621	Such was the case with the Black Sea invasion of the natural hybrid Pelophylax esculentus reported in 2010.
621	Several hundred frog species in adaptive radiations (e.g., Eleutherodactylus, the Pacific Platymantines, the Australo-Papuan microhylids, and many other tropical frogs), however, do not need any water for breeding in the wild.
621	They reproduce via direct development, an ecological and evolutionary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from free-standing water.
621	Almost all of these frogs live in wet tropical rainforests and ese frogs livtheir eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult, passing through the tadpole stage within the egg.
621	Reproductive success of many amphibians is dependent not only on the quantity of rainfall, but the seasonal timing.
621	In the tropics, many amphibians breed continuously or at any time of year.
621	In temperate regions, breeding is mostly seasonal, usually in the spring, and is triggered by increasing day length, rising temperatures or rainfall.
621	Experiments have shown the importance of temperature but the trigger event, especially in arid regions, is often a storm.
621	In anurans, males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active.
621	In caecilians, fertilisation is internal, the male extruding an intromittent organ, the phallodeum, and inserting it into the female cloaca.
621	The paired Müllerian glands inside the male cloaca secrete a fluid which resembles that produced by mammalian prostate glands and which may transport and nourish the sperm.
621	Fertilisation probably takes place in the oviduct.
621	The majority of salamanders also engage in internal fertilisation.
621	In most of these, the male deposits a spermatophore, a small packet of sperm on top of a gelatinous cone, on the substrate either on land or in the water.
621	The female takes up the sperm packet by grasping it with the lips of the cloaca and pushing it into the vent.
621	The spermatozoa move to the spermatheca in the roof of the cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may be many months later.
621	Courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the spermatophore vary between species.
621	In some, the spermatophore may be placed directly into the female cloaca while in others, the female may be guided to the spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called amplexus.
621	Certain primitive salamanders in the families Sirenidae, Hynobiidae and Cryptobranchidae practice external fertilisation in a similar manner to frogs, with the female laying the eggs in water and the male releasing sperm onto the egg mass.
621	With a few exceptions, frogs use external fertilisation.
621	The male grasps the female tightly with his forelimbs either behind the arms or in front of the back legs, or in the case of Epipedobates tricolor, around the neck.
621	They remain in amplexus with their cloacae positioned close together while the female lays the eggs and the male covers them with sperm.
621	Roughened nuptial pads on the male's hands aid in retaining grip.
621	Often the male collects and retains the egg mass, forming a sort of basket with the hind feet.
621	An exception is the granular poison frog (Oophaga granulifera) where the male and female place their cloacae in close proximity while facing in opposite directions and then release eggs and sperm simultaneously.
621	The tailed frog (Ascaphus truei) exhibits internal fertilisation.
621	The "tail" is only possessed by the male and is an extension of the cloaca and used to inseminate the female.
621	This frog lives in fast-flowing streams and internal fertilisation prevents the sperm from being washed away before fertilisation occurs.
621	The sperm may be retained in storage tubes attached to the oviduct until the following spring.
621	Most frogs can be classified as either prolonged or explosive breeders.
621	Typically, prolonged breeders congregate at a breeding site, the males usually arriving first, calling and setting up territories.
621	Other satellite males remain quietly nearby, waiting for their opportunity to take over a territory.
621	The females arrive sporadically, mate selection takes place and eggs are laid.
621	The females depart and territories may change hands.
621	More females appear and in due course, the breeding season comes to an end.
621	Explosive breeders on the other hand are found where temporary pools appear in dry regions after rainfall.
621	These frogs are typically fossorial species that emerge after heavy rains and congregate at a breeding site.
621	They are attracted there by the calling of the first male to find a suitable place, perhaps a pool that forms in the same place each rainy season.
621	The assembled frogs may call in unison and frenzied activity ensues, the males scrambling to mate with the usually smaller number of females.
621	Life cycle  Most amphibians go through metamorphosis, a process of significant morphological change after birth.
621	In typical amphibian development, eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle.
621	Frogs, toads and salamanders all hatch from the egg as larvae with external gills.
621	Metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by thyroxine concentration in the blood, which stimulates metamorphosis, and prolactin, which counteracts thyroxine's effect.
621	Specific events are dependent on threshold values for different tissues.
621	Because most embryonic development is outside the parental body, it is subject to many adaptations due to specific environmental circumstances.
621	For this reason tadpoles can have horny ridges instead of teeth, whisker-like skin extensions or fins.
621	They also make use of a sensory lateral line organ similar to that of fish.
621	After metamorphosis, these organs become redundant and will be reabsorbed by controlled cell death, called apoptosis.
621	The variety of adaptations to specific environmental circumstances among amphibians is wide, with many discoveries still being made.
621	Eggs  The egg of an amphibian is typically surrounded by a transparent gelatinous covering secreted by the oviducts and containing mucoproteins and mucopolysaccharides.
621	This capsule is permeable to water and gases, and swells considerably as it absorbs water.
621	The ovum is at first rigidly held but in fertilised eggs, the innermost layer liquefies and allows the embryo to move freely.
621	This also happens in salamander eggs even when they are unfertilised.
621	Eggs of some salamanders and frogs contain unicellular green algae.
621	These penetrate the jelly envelope after the eggs are laid and may increase the supply of oxygen to the embryo through photosynthesis.
621	They seem to both speed up the development of the larvae and reduce mortality.
621	Most eggs contain the pigment melanin which raises their temperature through the absorption of light and also protects them against ultraviolet radiation.
621	Caecilians, some plethodontid salamanders and certain frogs that lay eggs underground have unpigmented eggs.
621	In the wood frog (Rana sylvatica), the interior of the globular egg cluster has been found to be up to 6°C (11°F) warmer than its surroundings which is an advantage in its cool northern habitat.
621	The eggs may be deposited singly or in small groups, or may take the form of spherical egg masses, rafts or long strings.
621	In terrestrial caecilians, the eggs are laid in grape-like clusters in burrows near streams.
621	The amphibious salamander Ensatina attaches its similar clusters by stalks to underwater stems and roots.
621	The greenhouse frog (Eleutherodactylus planirostris) lays eggs in small groups in the soil where they develop in about two weeks directly into juvenile frogs without an intervening larval stage.
621	The tungara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus) builds a floating nest from foam to protect its eggs.
621	First a raft is built first, then eggs are laid in the centre, and then a foam cap is placed.
621	The foam has anti-microbial properties.
621	It contains no detergents but is created by whipping up proteins and lectins secreted by the female.
621	Larvae  The eggs of amphibians are typically laid in water and hatch into free-living larvae that complete their development in water and later transform into either aquatic or terrestrial adults.
621	In many species of frog and in most lungless salamanders (Plethodontidae), direct development takes place, the larvae growing within the eggs and emerging as miniature adults.
621	Many caecilians and some other amphibians lay their eggs on land, and the newly hatched larvae wriggle or are transported to water bodies.
621	Some caecilians, the Alpine salamander (Salamandra atra) and some of the African live-bearing toads (Nectophrynoides spp.) are viviparous.
621	Their larvae feed on glandular secretions and develop within the female's oviduct, often for long periods.
621	Other amphibians, but not caecilians, are ovoviviparous.
621	The eggs are retained in or on the parent's body but the larvae subsist on the yolks of their eggs and receive no nourishment from the adult.
621	The larvae emerge at varying stages of their growth, either before or after metamorphosis, according to their species.
621	The toad genus Nectophrynoides exhibits all of these developmental patterns among its dozen or so members.
621	Frogs  Frog larvae are known as tadpoles and typically have oval bodies and long, vertically flattened tails with fins.
621	The free living larvae are normally fully aquatic but the tadpoles of some species such as (Nannophrys ceylonensis) are semi-terrestrial and live among wet rocks.
621	Tadpoles have cartilaginous skeletons, gills for respiration (external gills at first, internal gills later), lateral line systems and large tails that they use for swimming.
621	Newly hatched tadpoles soon develop gill pouches that cover the gills.
621	The lungs develop early and are used as accessory breathing organs, the tadpoles rising to the water surface to gulp air.
621	Some species complete their development inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs.
621	These larvae do not have gills but instead have specialised areas of skin through which respiration takes place.
621	While tadpoles do not have true teeth, in most species, the jaws have long, parallel rows of small keratinized structures called keradonts surrounded by a horny beak.
621	Front legs are formed under the gill sac and hind legs become visible a few days later.
621	Tadpoles are typically herbivorous, feeding mostly on algae, including diatoms filtered from the water through the gills.
621	They are also detritivores, stirring up the sediment at the pond bottom and ingesting edible fragments.
621	They have a relatively long, spiral-shaped gut to enable them to digest this diet.
621	Some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage, eating insects, smaller tadpoles and fish.
621	Young of the Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) can occasionally be cannibalistic, the younger tadpoles attacking a larger, more developed tadpole when it is undergoing metamorphosis.
621	At metamorphosis, rapid changes in the body take place as the lifestyle of the frog changes completely.
621	The spiral‐shaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is reabsorbed together with the spiral gut.
621	The animal develops a large jaw, and its gills disappear along with its gill sac.
621	Eyes and legs grow quickly, and a tongue is formed.
621	There are associated changes in the neural networks such as development of stereoscopic vision and loss of the lateral line system.
621	All this can happen in about a day.
621	A few days later, the tail is reabsorbed, due to the higher thyroxine concentration required for this to take place.
621	Salamanders  At hatching, a typical salamander larva has eyes without lids, teeth in both upper and lower jaws, three pairs of feathery external gills, a somewhat laterally flattened body and a long tail with dorsal and ventral fins.
621	The forelimbs may be partially developed and the hind limbs are rudimentary in pond-living species but may be rather more developed in species that reproduce in moving water.
621	Pond-type larvae often have a pair of balancers, rod-like structures on either side of the head that may prevent the gills from becoming clogged up with sediment.
621	Some members of the genera Ambystoma and Dicamptodon have larvae that never fully develop into the adult form but this varies with species and with populations.
621	The northwestern salamander (Ambystoma gracile) is one of these and, depending on environmental factors, either remains permanently in the larval state, a condition known as neoteny, or transforms into an adult.
621	Both of these are able to breed.
621	Neoteny occurs when the animal's growth rate is very low and is usually linked to adverse conditions such as low water temperatures that may change the response of the tissues to the hormone thyroxine.
621	Other factors that may inhibit metamorphosis include lack of food, lack of trace elements and competition from conspecifics.
621	The tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) also sometimes behaves in this way and may grow particularly large in the process.
621	The adult tiger salamander is terrestrial, but the larva is aquatic and able to breed while still in the larval state.
621	When conditions are particularly inhospitable on land, larval breeding may allow continuation of a population that would otherwise die out.
621	There are fifteen species of obligate neotenic salamanders, including species of Necturus, Proteus and Amphiuma, and many examples of facultative ones that adopt this strategy under appropriate environmental circumstances.
621	Lungless salamanders in the family Plethodontidae are terrestrial and lay a small number of unpigmented eggs in a cluster among damp leaf litter.
621	Each egg has a large yolk sac and the larva feeds on this while it develops inside the egg, emerging fully formed as a juvenile salamander.
621	The female salamander often broods the eggs.
621	In the genus Ensatinas, the female has been observed to coil around them and press her throat area against them, effectively massaging them with a mucous secretion.
621	In newts and salamanders, metamorphosis is less dramatic than in frogs.
621	This is because the larvae are already carnivorous and continue to feed as predators when they are adults so few changes are needed to their digestive systems.
621	Their lungs are functional early but the larvae don't make as much use of them as do tadpoles.
621	Their gills are never covered by gill sacs and are reabsorbed just before the animals leave the water.
621	Other changes include the reduction in size or loss of tail fins, the closure of gill slits, thickening of the skin, the development of eyelids, and certain changes in dentition and tongue structure.
621	Salamanders are at their most vulnerable at metamorphosis as swimming speeds are reduced and transforming tails are encumbrances on land.
621	Adult salamanders often have an aquatic phase in spring and summer, and a land phase in winter.
621	For adaptation to a water phase, prolactin is the required hormone, and for adaptation to the land phase, thyroxine.
621	External gills do not return in subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving the water for the first time.
621	Caecilians  Most terrestrial caecilians that lay eggs do so in burrows or moist places on land near bodies of water.
621	The development of the young of Ichthyophis glutinosus, a species from Sri Lanka, has been much studied.
621	The eel-like larvae hatch out of the eggs and make their way to water.
621	They have three pairs of external red feathery gills, a blunt head with two rudimentary eyes, a lateral line system and a short tail with fins.
621	They swim by undulating their body from side to side.
621	They are mostly active at night, soon lose their gills and make sorties onto land.
621	Metamorphosis is gradual.
621	By the age of about ten months they have developed a pointed head with sensory tentacles near the mouth and lost their eyes, lateral line systems and tails.
621	The skin thickens, embedded scales develop and the body divides into segments.
621	By this time, the caecilian has constructed a burrow and is living on land.
621	In the majority of species of caecilians, the young are produced by vivipary.
621	Typhlonectes compressicauda, a species from South America, is typical of these.
621	Up to nine larvae can develop in the oviduct at any one time.
621	They are elongated and have paired sac-like gills, small eyes and specialised scraping teeth.
621	At first, they feed on the yolks of the eggs but as this source of nourishment declines they begin to rasp at the ciliated epithelial cells that line the oviduct.
621	This stimulates the secretion of fluids rich in lipids and mucoproteins on which they feed along with scrapings from the oviduct wall.
621	They may increase their length sixfold and be two-fifths as long as their mother before being born.
621	By this time they have undergone metamorphosis, lost their eyes and gills, developed a thicker skin and mouth tentacles, and reabsorbed their teeth.
621	A permanent set of teeth grow through soon after birth.
621	The ringed caecilian (Siphonops annulatus) has developed a unique adaptation for the purposes of reproduction.
621	The progeny feed on a skin layer that is specially developed by the adult in a phenomenon known as maternal dermatophagy.
621	The brood feed as a batch for about seven minutes at intervals of approximately three days which gives the skin an opportunity to regenerate.
621	Meanwhile they have been observed to ingest fluid exuded from the maternal cloaca.
621	Parental care  The care of offspring among amphibians has been little studied but, in general, the larger the number of eggs in a batch, the less likely it is that any degree of parental care takes place.
621	Nevertheless, it is estimated that in up to 20% of amphibian species, one or both adults play some role in the care of the young.
621	Those species that breed in smaller water bodies or other specialised habitats tend to have complex patterns of behaviour in the care of their young.
621	Many woodland salamanders lay clutches of eggs under dead logs or stones on land.
621	The black mountain salamander (Desmognathus welteri) does this, the mother brooding the eggs and guarding them from predation as the embryos feed on the yolks of their eggs.
621	When fully developed, they break their way out of the egg capsules and disperse as juvenile salamanders.
621	The male hellbender, a primitive salamander, excavates an underwater nest and encourages females to lay there.
621	The male then guards the site for the two or three months before the eggs hatch, using body undulations to fan the eggs and increase their supply of oxygen.
621	The male Colostethus subpunctatus, a tiny frog, protects the egg cluster which is hidden under a stone or log.
621	When the eggs hatch, the male transports the tadpoles on his back, stuck there by a mucous secretion, to a temporary pool where he dips himself into the water and the tadpoles drop off.
621	The male midwife toad (Alytes obstetricans) winds egg strings round his thighs and carries the eggs around for up to eight weeks.
621	He keeps them moist and when they are ready to hatch, he visits a pond or ditch and releases the tadpoles.
621	The female gastric-brooding frog (Rheobatrachus spp.) reared larvae in her stomach after swallowing either the eggs or hatchlings, however this stage was never observed before the species became extinct.
621	The tadpoles secrete a hormone that inhibits digestion in the mother whilst they develop by consuming their very large yolk supply.
621	The pouched frog (Assa darlingtoni) lays eggs on the ground.
621	When they hatch, the male carries the tadpoles around in brood pouches on his hind legs.
621	The aquatic Surinam toad (Pipa pipa) raises its young in pores on its back where they remain until metamorphosis.
621	The granular poison frog (Oophaga granulifera) is typical of a number of tree frogs in the poison dart frog family Dendrobatidae.
621	Its eggs are laid on the forest floor and when they hatch, the tadpoles are carried one by one on the back of an adult to a suitable water-filled crevice such as the axil of a leaf or the rosette of a bromeliad.
621	The female visits the nursery sites regularly and deposits unfertilised eggs in the water and these are consumed by the tadpoles.
621	Feeding and diet  With a few exceptions, adult amphibians are predators, feeding on virtually anything that moves that they can swallow.
621	The diet mostly consists of small prey that do not move too fast such as beetles, caterpillars, earthworms and spiders.
621	The sirens (Siren spp.) often ingest aquatic plant material with the invertebrates on which they feed and a Brazilian tree frog Xenohyla truncata includes a large quantity of fruit in its diet.
621	The Mexican burrowing toad (Rhinophrynus dorsalis) has a specially adapted tongue for picking up ants and termites.
621	It projects it with the tip foremost whereas other frogs flick out the rear part first, their tongues being hinged at the front.
621	Food is mostly selected by sight, even in conditions of dim light.
621	Movement of the prey triggers a feeding response.
621	Frogs have been caught on fish hooks baited with red flannel and green frogs (Rana clamitans) have been found with stomachs full of elm seeds that they had seen floating past.
621	Toads, salamanders and caecilians also use smell to detect prey.
621	This response is mostly secondary because salamanders have been observed to remain stationary near odoriferous prey but only feed if it moves.
621	Cave-dwelling amphibians normally hunt by smell.
621	Some salamanders seem to have learned to recognize immobile prey when it has no smell, even in complete darkness.
621	Amphibians usually swallow food whole but may chew it lightly first to subdue it.
621	They typically have small hinged pedicellate teeth, a feature unique to amphibians.
621	The base and crown of these are composed of dentine separated by an uncalcified layer and they are replaced at intervals.
621	Salamanders, caecilians and some frogs have one or two rows of teeth in both jaws but some frogs (Rana spp.) lack teeth in the lower jaw, and toads (Bufo spp.) have no teeth.
621	In many amphibians there are also vomerine teeth attached to a facial bone in the roof of the mouth.
621	The tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) is typical of the frogs and salamanders that hide under cover ready to ambush unwary invertebrates.
621	Others amphibians, such as the Bufo spp.
621	Argentine horned frog (Ceratophrys ornata) lures inquisitive prey closer by raising its hind feet over its back and vibrating its yellow toes.
621	Among leaf litter frogs in Panama, frogs that actively hunt prey have narrow mouths and are slim, often brightly coloured and toxic, while ambushers have wide mouths and are broad and well-camouflaged.
621	Caecilians do not flick their tongues, but catch their prey by grabbing it with their slightly backward-pointing teeth.
621	The struggles of the prey and further jaw movements work it inwards and the caecilian usually retreats into its burrow.
621	The subdued prey is gulped down whole.
621	When they are newly hatched, frog larvae feed on the yolk of the egg.
621	When this is exhausted some move on to feed on bacteria, algal crusts, detritus and raspings from submerged plants.
621	Water is drawn in through their mouths, which are usually at the bottom of their heads, and passes through branchial food traps between their mouths and their gills where fine particles are trapped in mucus and filtered out.
621	Others have specialised mouthparts consisting of a horny beak edged by several rows of labial teeth.
621	They scrape and bite food of many kinds as well as stirring up the bottom sediment, filtering out larger particles with the papillae around their mouths.
621	Some, such as the spadefoot toads, have strong biting jaws and are carnivorous or even cannibalistic.
621	Vocalization  The calls made by caecilians and salamanders are limited to occasional soft squeaks, grunts or hisses and have not been much studied.
621	A clicking sound sometimes produced by caecilians may be a means of orientation, as in bats, or a form of communication.
621	Most salamanders are considered voiceless but the California giant salamander (Dicamptodon ensatus) has vocal cords and can produce a rattling or barking sound.
621	Some species of salamander emit a quiet squeak or yelp if attacked.
621	Frogs are much more vocal, especially during the breeding season when they use their voices to attract mates.
621	The presence of a particular species in an area may be more easily discerned by its characteristic call than by a fleeting glimpse of the animal itself.
621	In most species, the sound is produced by expelling air from the lungs over the vocal cords into an air sac or sacs in the throat or at the corner of the mouth.
621	This may distend like a balloon and acts as a resonator, helping to transfer the sound to the atmosphere, or the water at times when the animal is submerged.
621	The main vocalisation is the male's loud advertisement call which seeks to both encourage a female to approach and discourage other males from intruding on its territory.
621	This call is modified to a quieter courtship call on the approach of a female or to a more aggressive version if a male intruder draws near.
621	Calling carries the risk of attracting predators and involves the expenditure of much energy.
621	Other calls include those given by a female in response to the advertisement call and a release call given by a male or female during unwanted attempts at amplexus.
621	When a frog is attacked, a distress or fright call is emitted, often resembling a scream.
621	The usually nocturnal Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) produces a rain call when there is rainfall during daylight hours.
621	Territorial behaviour  Little is known of the territorial behaviour of caecilians, but some frogs and salamanders defend home ranges.
621	These are usually feeding, breeding or sheltering sites.
621	Males normally exhibit such behaviour though in some species, females and even juveniles are also involved.
621	Although in many frog species, females are larger than males, this is not the case in most species where males are actively involved in territorial defence.
621	Some of these have specific adaptations such as enlarged teeth for biting or spines on the chest, arms or thumbs.
621	In salamanders, defence of a territory involves adopting an aggressive posture and if necessary attacking the intruder.
621	This may involve snapping, chasing and sometimes biting, occasionally causing the loss of a tail.
621	The behaviour of red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) has been much studied.
621	A similar proportion, when moved experimentally a distance of 30 m, found their way back to their home base.
621	The salamanders left odour marks around their territories which averaged  in size and were sometimes inhabited by a male and female pair.
621	These deterred the intrusion of others and delineated the boundaries between neighbouring areas.
621	Much of their behaviour seemed stereotyped and did not involve any actual contact between individuals.
621	An aggressive posture involved raising the body off the ground and glaring at the opponent who often turned away submissively.
621	If the intruder persisted, a biting lunge was usually launched at either the tail region or the naso-labial grooves.
621	Damage to either of these areas can reduce the fitness of the rival, either because of the need to regenerate tissue or because it impairs its ability to detect food.
621	In frogs, male territorial behaviour is often observed at breeding locations; calling is both an announcement of ownership of part of this resource and an advertisement call to potential mates.
621	In general, a deeper voice represents a heavier and more powerful individual, and this may be sufficient to prevent intrusion by smaller males.
621	Much energy is used in the vocalization and it takes a toll on the territory holder who may be displaced by a fitter rival if he tires.
621	There is a tendency for males to tolerate the holders of neighbouring territories while vigorously attacking unknown intruders.
621	Holders of territories have a "home advantage" and usually come off better in an encounter between two similar-sized frogs.
621	If threats are insufficient, chest to chest tussles may take place.
621	Fighting methods include pushing and shoving, deflating the opponent's vocal sac, seizing him by the head, jumping on his back, biting, chasing, splashing, and ducking him under the water.
621	Defence mechanisms  Amphibians have soft bodies and thin skins, lack claws, defensive armour or spines and seem relatively helpless.
621	Nevertheless they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive.
621	The first line of defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce.
621	This keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult to grip.
621	The secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic.
621	Snakes have been observed yawning and gaping when trying to swallow African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis), which gives the frogs an opportunity to escape.
621	Caecilians have been little studied in this respect but the Cayenne caecilian (Typhlonectes compressicauda) produces toxic mucus that has killed predatory fish in a feeding experiment in Brazil.
621	In some salamanders, the skin is poisonous.
621	The rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa) from North America and other members of its genus contain the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (TTX), the most toxic non-protein substance known and almost identical to that produced by pufferfish.
621	Handling the newts does not cause harm but ingestion of even the most minute amounts of the skin is deadly.
621	In feeding trials, fish, frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals were all found to be susceptible.
621	The only predators with some tolerance to the poison are certain populations of common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis).
621	In locations where both snake and salamander co-exist, the snakes have developed immunity through genetic changes and they feed on the amphibians with impunity.
621	Coevolution occurs with the newt increasing its toxic cassue7034 |pmid 15815629 }pabilities at the same rate as the snake further develops its immunity.
621	Some frogs and toads are toxic, the main poison glands being at the side of the neck and under the warts on the back.
621	These regions are presented to the attacking animal and their secretions may be foul-tasting or cause various physical or neurological symptoms.
621	Altogether, over 200 toxins have been isolated from the limited number of amphibian species that have been investigated.
621	Poisonous species often use bright colouring to warn potential predators of their toxicity.
621	These warning colours tend to be red or yellow combined with black, with the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) being an example.
621	Once a predator has sampled one of these, it is likely to remember the colouration next time it encounters a similar animal.
621	In some species, such as the fire-bellied toad (Bombina spp.), the warning colouration is on the belly and these animals adopt a defensive pose when attacked, exhibiting their bright colours to the predator.
621	The frog Allobates zaparo is not poisonous, but mimics the appearance of other toxic species in its locality, a strategy that may deceive predators.
621	Many amphibians are nocturnal and hide during the day, thereby avoiding diurnal predators that hunt by sight.
621	Other amphibians use camouflage to avoid being detected.
621	They have various colourings such as mottled browns, greys and olives to blend into the background.
621	Some salamanders adopt defensive poses when faced by a potential predator such as the North American northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda).
621	Their bodies writhe and they raise and lash their tails which makes it difficult for the predator to avoid contact with their poison-producing granular glands.
621	A few salamanders will autotomise their tails when attacked, sacrificing this part of their anatomy to enable them to escape.
621	The tail may have a constriction at its base to allow it to be easily detached.
621	The tail is regenerated later but the energy cost to the animal of replacing it is significant.
621	Some frogs and toads inflate themselves to make themselves look large and fierce, and some spadefoot toads (Pelobates spp) scream and leap towards the attacker.
621	Giant salamanders of the genus Andrias, as well as Ceratophrine and Pyxicephalus frogs possess sharp teeth and are capable of drawing blood with a defensive bite.
621	The blackbelly salamander (Desmognathus quadramaculatus) can bite an attacking common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis) two or three times its size on the head and often manages to escape.
621	Conservation  Dramatic declines in amphibian populations, including population crashes and mass localized extinction, have been noted since the late 1980s from locations all over the world, and amphibian declines are thus perceived to be one of the most critical threats to global biodiversity.
621	In 2006 there were believed to be 4,035 species of amphibians that depended on water at some stage during their life cycle.
621	Of these, 1,356 (33.6%) were considered to be threatened and this figure is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1,427 species for which there was insufficient data to assess their status.
621	A number of causes are believed to be involved, including habitat destruction and modification, over-exploitation, pollution, introduced species, climate change, endocrine-disrupting pollutants, destruction of the ozone layer (ultraviolet radiation has shown to be especially damaging to the skin, eyes, and eggs of amphibians), and diseases like chytridiomycosis.
621	However, many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and are a topic of ongoing discussion.
621	With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often considered to be ecological indicators.
621	In many terrestrial ecosystems, they constitute one of the largest parts of the vertebrate biomass.
621	Any decline in amphibian numbers will have an impact on the patterns of predation.
621	The loss of carnivorous species near the top of the food chain will upset the delicate ecosystem balance and may cause dramatic increases in opportunistic species.
621	In the Middle East, a growing appetite for eating frog legs and the consequent gathering of them for food was linked to an increase in mosquitoes.
621	Predators that feed on amphibians are affected by their decline.
621	The western terrestrial garter snake (Thamnophis elegans) in California is largely aquatic and depends heavily on two species of frog that are diminishing in numbers, the Yosemite toad (Bufo canorus) and the mountain yellow-legged frog (Rana muscosa), putting the snake's future at risk.
621	If the snake were to become scarce, this would affect birds of prey and other predators that feed on it.
621	Meanwhile, in the ponds and lakes, fewer frogs means fewer tadpoles.
621	These normally play an important role in controlling the growth of algae and also forage on detritus that accumulates as sediment on the bottom.
621	A reduction in the number of tadpoles may lead to an overgrowth of algae, resulting in depletion of oxygen in the water when the algae later die and decompose.
621	Aquatic invertebrates and fish might then die and there would be unpredictable ecological consequences.
621	A global strategy to stem the crisis was released in 2005 in the form of the Amphibian Conservation Action Plan.
621	Developed by over eighty leading experts in the field, this call to action details what would be required to curtail amphibian declines and extinctions over the following five years and how much this would cost.
621	The Amphibian Specialist Group of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) is spearheading efforts to implement a comprehensive global strategy for amphibian conservation.
621	Amphibian Ark is an organization that was formed to implement the ex-situ conservation recommendations of this plan, and they have been working with zoos and aquaria around the world, encouraging them to create assurance colonies of threatened amphibians.
621	One such project is the Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project that built on existing conservation efforts in Panama to create a country-wide response to the threat of chytridiomycosis.
621	Study The study of amphibians is called batrachology while the study of both reptiles and amphibians is called herpetology.
621	These are part of the broader discipline of zoology but are seldom studied alone.
621	Research in these fields may explore the animals' taxonomy, morphology, behaviour, ecology, physiology or biochemistry.
621	The results of the research are peer-reviewed and published in scientific journals.
621	Career opportunities include field research, university teaching and research, curating, museum research or management, zoo keeping, breeding or selling animals and wildlife management.
624	Alaska is a state in the United States, situated in the northwest extremity of the North American continent, with the international boundary with Canada to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and the Pacific Ocean to the west and south, with Russia further west across the Bering Strait.
624	Alaska is the largest state in the United States by area, the 4th least populous and the least densely populated of the 50 United States.
624	Approximately half of Alaska's 731,449 residents live within the Anchorage metropolitan area.
624	Alaska's economy is dominated by the oil, natural gas, and fishing industries; it has these resources in abundance.
624	Alaska was purchased from Russia on March 30, 1867, for $7.2 million ($ adjusted for inflation) at approximately two cents per acre ($4.74/km²).
624	The land went through several administrative changes before becoming an organized (or incorporated) territory on May 11, 1912, and the 49th state of the U.S.
624	January 3, 1959.
624	The name "Alaska" (Аляска) was already introduced in the Russian colonial period, when it was used only for the peninsula and is derived from the Aleut alaxsxaq, meaning "the mainland" or, more literally, "the object towards which the action of the sea is directed".
624	It is also known as Alyeska, the "great land", an Aleut word derived from the same root.
624	Geography Alaska has a longer coastline than all the other U.S.
624	It is the only non-contiguous U.S.
624	North America; about 500 mi of  only non-contiguous U.British Columbia (Canada) separates Alaska from Washington state.
624	Alaska is thus an exclave of the United States, possibly the largest exclave in the world.
624	It is technically part of the continental U.S., but is often not included in colloquial use; Alaska is not part of the contiguous U.S., often called "the Lower 48".
624	The capital city, Juneau, is situated on the mainland of the North American continent, but is not connected by road to the rest of the North American highway system.
624	The state is bordered by the Yukon Territory and British Columbia in Canada, to the east, the Gulf of Alaska and the Pacific Ocean to the south, the Bering Sea, Bering Strait, and Chukchi Sea to the west and the Arctic Ocean to the north.
624	Alaska's territorial waters touch Russia's territorial waters in the Bering Strait, as the Russian Big Diomede Island and Alaskan Little Diomede Island are only 3 mi apart.
624	With the extension of the Aleutian Islands into the eastern hemisphere, it is technically both the westernmost and easternmost state in the United States, as well as also being the northernmost.
624	Alaska is the largest state in the United States in land area at 586412 sqmi, over twice the size of Texas, the next largest state.
624	Alaska is larger than all but 18 sovereign countries.
624	Counting territorial waters, Alaska is larger than the combined area of the next three largest states: Texas, California, and Montana.
624	It is also larger than the combined area of the 22 smallest U.S.
624	Regions There are no officially defined borders demarcating the various regions of Alaska, but there are six widely accepted regions: South Central The most populous region of Alaska, containing Anchorage, the Matanuska-Susitna Valley and the Kenai Peninsula.
624	Rural, mostly unpopulated areas south of the Alaska Range and west of the Wrangell Mountains also fall within the definition of Southcentral, as well as the Prince William Sound area and the communities of Cordova and Valdez.
624	Southeast Also referred to as the Panhandle or Inside Passage, this is the region of Alaska closest to the rest of the United States.
624	As such, this was where most of the initial non-indigenous settlement occurred in the years following the Alaska Purchase.
624	The region is dominated by the Alexander Archipelago as well as the Tongass National Forest, the largest national forest in the United States.
624	It contains the state capital, Juneau, the former capital, Sitka, and Ketchikan, at one time Alaska's largest city.
624	The Alaska Marine Highway provides a vital surface transportation link throughout the area, as only three communities (Haines, Hyder and Skagway) enjoy direct connections to the contiguous North American road system.
624	Interior The largest region of Alaska, much of the interior is uninhabited wilderness.
624	Fairbanks is the only large city in the region.
624	Small towns and Native villages are scattered throughout, mostly along the highway and river systems.
624	Denali National Park and Preserve is located here, home to Mount McKinley (also widely known by its local name of Denali), the highest point in North America.
624	Southwest Southwest Alaska is a sparsely inhabited region stretching some 500 mi inland from the Bering Sea.
624	Most of the population lives along the coast.
624	Kodiak Island is also located in Southwest.
624	The massive Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta, one of the largest river deltas in the world, is here.
624	Portions of the Alaska Peninsula are considered part of Southwest, with the remaining portions included with the Aleutian Islands (see below).
624	North Slope The North Slope is mostly tundra peppered with small villages.
624	The area is known for its massive reserves of crude oil, and contains both the National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska and the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field.
624	Barrow, the northernmost city in the United States, is located here.
624	The Northwest Arctic area, anchored by Kotzebue and also containing the Kobuk River valley, is often regarded as being part of this region.
624	However, the respective Inupiat of the North Slope and of the Northwest Arctic seldom think of themselves as one.
624	Aleutian Islands More than 300 small, volcanic islands make up this chain, which stretches over 1200 mi into the Pacific Ocean.
624	The International Date Line was drawn west of 180° to keep the whole state, and thus the entire North American continent, within the same legal day.
624	However, because some of these islands fall in the Eastern Hemisphere, this makes Alaska the northernmost, easternmost and westernmost state in the union, with the southernmost state being Hawaii.
624	Two of the islands, Attu and Kiska, were occupied by Japanese forces during World War II.
624	Natural features With its myriad islands, Alaska has nearly 34000 mi of tidal shoreline.
624	The Aleutian Islands chain extends west from the southern tip of the Alaska Peninsula.
624	Many active volcanoes are found in the Aleutians and in coastal regions.
624	Unimak Island, for example, is home to Mount Shishaldin, which is an occasionally smoldering volcano that rises to 10000 ft above the North Pacific.
624	It is the most perfect volcanic cone on Earth, even more symmetrical than Japan's Mount Fuji.
624	The chain of volcanoes extends to Mount Spurr, west of Anchorage on the mainland.
624	Geologists have identified Alaska as part of Wrangellia, a large region consisting of multiple states and Canadian provinces in the Pacific Northwest which is actively undergoing continent building.
624	One of the world's largest tides occurs in Turnagain Arm, just south of Anchorage – tidal differences can be more than 35 ft.
624	Many sources say Turnagain has the second-greatest tides in North America, but several areas in Canada have larger tides.) Alaska has more than three million lakes.
624	Marshlands and wetland permafrost cover 188320 sqmi (mostly in northern, western and southwest flatlands).
624	Glacier ice covers some 16000 sqmi of land and 1200 sqmi of tidal zone.
624	The Bering Glacier complex near the southeastern border with Yukon covers 2250 sqmi alone.
624	With over 100,000, Alaska has half of the world's glaciers.
624	Land ownership According to an October 1998 report by the United States Bureau of Land Management, approximately 65% of Alaska is owned and managed by the U.S.
624	Of these, the Bureau of Land Management manages  87 e6acre, or 23.8% of the state.
624	The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.
624	It is the world's largest wildlife refuge, comprising 16 e6acre.
624	Of the remaining land area, the state of Alaska owns 101 e6acre;  its entitlement under the Alaska Statehood Act.
624	A portion of that acreage is occasionally ceded to organized boroughs, under the statutory provisions pertaining to newly formed boroughs.
624	Smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other homesteading-related opportunities, though these are infrequently popular due to the often remote and roadless locations.
624	The University of Alaska, as a land grant university, also owns substantial acreage which it manages independently.
624	Another 44 e6acre are owned by 12 regional, and scores of local, Native corporations created under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.
624	Regional Native corporation Doyon, Limited often promotes itself as the largest private landowner in Alaska in advertisements and other communications.
624	Provisions of ANCSA allowing the corporations' land holdings to be sold on the open market starting in 1991 were repealed before they could take effect.
624	Effectively, the corporations hold title (including subsurface title in many cases, a privilege denied to individual Alaskans) but cannot sell the land.
624	Individual Native allotments can be and are sold on the open market, however.
624	Various private interests own the remaining land, totaling about one percent of the state.
624	Alaska is, by a large margin, the state with the smallest percentage of private land ownership when Native corporation holdings are excluded.
624	Climate The climate in Southeast Alaska is a mid-latitude oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification Cfb) in the southern sections and a subarctic oceanic climate (Köppen Cfc) in the northern parts.
624	On an annual basis, Southeast is both the wettest and warmest part of Alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year.
624	Juneau averages over 50 in of precipitation a year, and Ketchikan averages over 150 in.
624	This is also the only region in Alaska in which the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter months.
624	The climate of Anchorage and south central Alaska is mild by Alaskan standards due to the region's proximity to the seacoast.
624	While the area gets less rain than southeast Alaska, it gets more snow, and days tend to be clearer.
624	On average, Anchorage receives 16 in of precipitation a year, with around 75 in of snow, although there are areas in the south central which receive far more snow.
624	It is a subarctic climate (Köppen Dfc) due to its brief, cool summers.
624	The climate of Western Alaska is determined in large part by the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska.
624	It is a subarctic oceanic climate in the southwest and a continental subarctic climate farther north.
624	The temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is.
624	This region has a tremendous amount of variety in precipitation.
624	An area stretching from the northern side of the Seward Peninsula to the Kobuk River valley is technically a desert, with portions receiving less than 10 in of precipitation annually.
624	On the other extreme, some locations between Dillingham and Bethel average around 100 in of precipitation.
624	The climate of the interior of Alaska is subarctic.
624	Some of the highest and lowest temperatures in Alaska occur around the area near Fairbanks.
624	The summers may have temperatures reaching into the 90s °F (the low to mid 30s °C), while in the winter, the temperature can fall below .
624	Precipitation is sparse in the Interior, often less than 10 in a year, but what precipitation falls in the winter tends to stay the entire winter.
624	The highest and lowest recorded temperatures in Alaska are both in the Interior.
624	The highest is 100 °F in Fort Yukon (which is just 8 mi inside the arctic circle) on June 27, 1915, making Alaska tied with Hawaii as the state with the lowest high temperature in the United States.
624	The lowest official Alaska temperature is  in Prospect Creek on January 23, 1971, one degree above the lowest temperature recorded in continental North America (in Snag, Yukon, Canada).
624	The climate in the extreme north of Alaska is Arctic (Köppen ET) with long, very cold winters and short, cool summers.
624	Even in July, the average low temperature in Barrow is 34 °F.
624	Precipitation is light in this part of Alaska, with many places averaging less than 10 in per year, mostly as snow which stays on the ground almost the entire year.
624	History Alaska natives Numerous indigenous people occupied Alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of European peoples to the area.
624	The Tlingit people developed a matrilineal society in what is today Southeast Alaska, along with parts of British Columbia and the Yukon.
624	Also in Southeast were the Haida, now well known for their unique arts.
624	The Tsimshian people came to Alaska from British Columbia in 1887, when President Grover Cleveland, and later the U.S.
624	Congress, granted them permission to settle on Annette Island and found the town of Metlakatla.
624	All three of these peoples, as well as other indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast, experienced smallpox outbreaks from the late 18th through the mid-19th century, with the most devastating epidemics arriving in the 1830s and 1860s.
624	The Aleutian Islands are still home to the Aleut people's seafaring society, although they were the first Native Alaskans to be exploited by Russians.
624	Western and Southwestern Alaska are home to the Yup'ik, while their cousins the Alutiiq lived in what is now Southcentral Alaska.
624	The Gwich’in people of the northern Interior region are primarily known today for their dependence on the caribou within the much-contested Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
624	The North Slope and Little Diomede Island are occupied by the widespread Inuit people.
624	Colonization Some researchers believe that the first Russian settlement in Alaska was established in 17th century.
624	According to this hypothesis, in 1648 several koches of Semyon Dezhnyov's expedition were thrown to Alaska by storm and founded this settlement.
624	This hypothesis is based on the message of Chukchi geographer Nikolai Daurkin who had visited Alaska in 1764–1765 and reported about a village on the Kheuveren river, populated by "bearded men" who "pray to the icons".
624	Some modern researchers associate Kheuveren with Koyuk River.
624	It is usually assumed that the first European boat to reach Alaska was the St.
624	Gabriel under the authority of the surveyor M.
624	S.
624	Gvozdev and assistant navigator I.
624	Fyodorov on August 21, 1732 during expedition of Siberian cossak A.
624	F.
624	Shestakov and Belorussian explorer D.
624	I.
624	Pavlutsky (1729—1735) Another European contact with Alaska occurred in 1741, when Vitus Bering led an expedition for the Russian Navy aboard the St.
624	Peter.
624	After his crew returned to Russia with sea otter pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world, small associations of fur traders began to sail from the shores of Siberia towards the Aleutian islands.
624	The first permanent European settlement was founded in 1784.
624	Between 1774 and 1800 Spain sent several expeditions to Alaska in order to assert its claim over the Pacific Northwest.
624	In 1789 a Spanish settlement and fort were built in Nootka Sound.
624	These expeditions gave names to places such as Valdez, Bucareli Sound, and Cordova.
624	Later, the Russian-American Company carried out an expanded colonization program during the early-to-mid-19th century.
624	Sitka, renamed New Archangel from 1804 to 1867, on Baranof Island in the Alexander Archipelago in what is now Southeast Alaska, became the capital of Russian America and remained the capital after the colony was transferred to the United States.
624	The Russians never fully colonized Alaska, and the colony was never very profitable.
624	William H.
624	Seward, the United States Secretary of State, negotiated the Alaska Purchase (also known as Seward's Folly) with the Russians in 1867 for $7.2 million.
624	Alaska was loosely governed by the military initially, and was administered as a district starting in 1884, with a governor appointed by the president of the United States, as well as a district court headquartered in Sitka.
624	For most of Alaska's first decade under the American flag, Sitka was the only community inhabited by American settlers.
624	They organized a "provisional city government," which was Alaska's first city government, but not in a legal sense.
624	Legislation allowing Alaskan communities to legally incorporate as cities did not come about until 1900, and home rule for cities was extremely limited or unavailable until statehood took effect.
624	U.S.
624	Territory Starting in the 1890s and stretching in some places to the early 1910s, gold rushes in Alaska and the nearby Yukon Territory brougrly 1910s, Sitka until 1906, was moved north to Juneau, and began to take shape with the construction of the Alaska Governor's Mansion that same year.
624	During World War II, the Aleutian Islands Campaign focused on the three outer Aleutian Islands – Attu, Agattu and Kiska – that were invaded by Japanese troops and occupied between June 1942 and August 1943.
624	Unalaska/Dutch Harbor became a significant base for the U.S.
624	Army Air Corps and Navy submariners.
624	The U.S.
624	Lend-Lease program involved the flying of American warplanes through Canada to Fairbanks and thence Nome; Soviet pilots took possession of these aircraft, ferrying them to fight the German invasion of the Soviet Union.
624	The construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some Alaskan cities.
624	Statehood Statehood for Alaska was an important cause of James Wickersham early in his tenure as a congressional delegate.
624	Decades later, the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in 1946.
624	The Alaska Statehood Committee and Alaska's Constitutional Convention would soon follow.
624	Statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes, mostly in the U.S.
624	Congress but also within Alaska.
624	Statehood was approved by Congress on July 7, 1958.
624	Alaska was officially proclaimed a state on January 3, 1959.
624	On March 27, 1964, the massive "Good Friday Earthquake" killed 133 people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities, mainly by the resultant tsunamis and landslides.
624	It was the third most powerful earthquake in the recorded history of the world, with a moment magnitude of 9.2.
624	It was over one thousand times more powerful than the 1989 San Francisco earthquake.
624	The time of day (5:36 pm), time of year and location of the epicenter were all cited as factors in potentially sparing thousands of lives, particularly in Anchorage.
624	The 1968 discovery of oil at Prudhoe Bay and the 1977 completion of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline led to an oil boom.
624	Royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from 1980 onward.
624	That same year, not coincidentally, Alaska repealed its state income tax.
624	In 1989, the Exxon Valdez hit a reef in the Prince William Sound, spilling over 11000000 USgal of crude oil over 1,100 miles (1,600 km) of coastline.
624	Today, the battle between philosophies of development and conservation is seen in the contentious debate over oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
624	Demographics The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Alaska was 731,449 on July 1, 2012, a 3.0% increase since the 2010 United States Census.
624	In 2010, Alaska ranked as the 47th state by population, ahead of North Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming (and Washington, D.C.) Alaska is the least densely populated state, and one of the most sparsely populated areas in the world, at , with the next state, Wyoming, at .
624	Alaska is the largest U.S.
624	As of April 2012, the state's unemployment rate was 6.9%.
624	Race and ancestry According to the 2010 United States Census, Alaska had a population of 710,231.
624	In terms of race and ethnicity, the state was 66.7% White (64.1% Non-Hispanic White), 14.8% American Indian and Alaska Native, 5.4% Asian, 3.3% Black or African American, 1.0% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 1.6% from Some Other Race, and 7.3% from Two or More Races.
624	Hispanics or Latinos of any race made up 5.5% of the population.
624	In 1960, the Census Bureau reported Alaska's population as 77.2% White, 3% Black, and 18.8% American Indian and Alaska Native.
624	As of 2011, 50.7% of Alaska's population younger than age 1 were minorities.
624	Languages According to the 2005–2007 American Community Survey, 84.7% of people over the age of five speak only English at home.
624	About 3.5% speak Spanish at home.
624	About 2.2% speak another Indo-European language at home and aboat home.
624	About 2ut 4.3% speak an Asian language at home.
624	And about 5.3% speak other languages at home.
624	A total of 5.2% of Alaskans speak one of the state's 22 indigenous languages, known locally as "native languages".
624	These languages belong to two major language families: Eskimo–Aleut and Na-Dene.
624	As the homeland of these two major language families of North America, Alaska has been described as the crossroads of the continent, providing evidence for the recent settlement of North America by way of the Bering land bridge.
624	Religion Alaska has been identified, along with Pacific Northwest states Washington and Oregon, as being the least religious in the U.S.
624	According to statistics collected by the Association of Religion Data Archives, about 39% of Alaska residents were members of religious congregations.
624	Evangelical Protestants had 78,070 members, Roman Catholics had 54,359, and mainline Protestants had 37,156.
624	After Catholicism, the largest single denominations are The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with 30,169, and Southern Baptists with 22,959.
624	The large Eastern Orthodox (with 49 parishes and up to 50,000 followers) population is a result of early Russian colonization and missionary work among Alaska Natives.
624	In 1795, the First Russian Orthodox Church was established in Kodiak.
624	Intermarriage with Alaskan Natives helped the Russian immigrants integrate into society.
624	As a result, an increasing number of Russian Orthodox churches gradually became established within Alaska.
624	Alaska also has the largest Quaker population (by percentage) of any state.
624	In 2009 there were 6,000 Jews in Alaska (for whom observance of halakha may pose special problems).
624	Estimates for the number of Alaskan Muslims range from 2,000 to 5,000.
624	In 2010, the local Muslim community broke ground on the first mosque in the state.
624	Alaskan Hindus often share venues and celebrations with members of other religious communities including Sikhs and Jains.
624	Economy The 2007 gross state product was $44.9 billion, 45th in the nation.
624	Its per capita personal income for 2007 was $40,042, ranking 15th in the nation.
624	The oil and gas industry dominates the Alaskan economy, with more than 80% of the state's revenues derived from petroleum extraction.
624	Alaska's main export product (excluding oil and natural gas) is seafood, primarily salmon, cod, Pollock and crab.
624	Agriculture represents only a fraction of the Alaskan economy.
624	Agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock, dairy products, vegetables, and livestock.
624	Manufacturing is limited, with most foodstuffs and general goods oducts, vegetableimported from elsewhere.
624	Employment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction, shipping, and transportation.
624	Military bases are a significant component of the economy in both Fairbanks and Anchorage.
624	Federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy, allowing the state to keep taxes low.
624	Its industrial outputs are crude petroleum, natural gas, coal, gold, precious metals, zinc and other mining, seafood processing, timber and wood products.
624	There is also a growing service and tourism sector.
624	Tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging.
624	Largest employers According to the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the following were the state's largest private sector employers in 2010: Energy Alaska has vast energy resources.
624	Major oil and gas reserves are found in the Alaska North Slope (ANS) and Cook Inlet basins.
624	According to the Energy Information Administration, Alaska ranks second in the nation in crude oil production.
624	Prudhoe Bay on Alaska's North Slope is the highest yielding oil field in the United States and on North America, typically producing about 400000 oilbbl/d.
624	The Trans-Alaska Pipeline can transport and pump up to  of crude oil per day, more than any other crude oil pipeline in the United States.
624	Additionally, substantial coal deposits are found in Alaska's bituminous, sub-bituminous, and lignite coal basins.
624	The United States Geological Survey estimates that there are  of undiscovered, technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the Alaskan North Slope.
624	Alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers.
624	Large swaths of the Alaskan coastline offer wind and geothermal energy potential as well.
624	Alaska's economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating, transportation, electric power and light.
624	Though wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped, proposals for state-wide energy systems (e.g.
624	File:Alaska Crude Oil Reserves.PNG|Alaska oil reserves peaked in 1978 and have declined 60% thereafter File:Alaska Crude  ReserveOil Production.PNG|Alaska oil production peaked in 1988 and has declined 65% since Permanent Fund The Alaska Permanent Fund is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues, established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil, largely in anticipation of same from the recently constructed Trans-Alaska Pipeline System.
624	The fund was originally proposed by Governor Keith Miller on the eve of the 1969 Prudhoe Bay lease sale, out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale (which amounted to $900 million) at once, and was later championed by Governor Jay Hammond and Kenai state representative Hugh Malone.
624	It has served as an attractive political prospect ever since, diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund.
624	The Alaska Constitution was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose.
624	The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this, mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation.
624	From its initial principal of $734,000, the fund has grown to $40 billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs.
624	Most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside Alaska.
624	This has led to frequent calls by Alaskan politicians for the Fund to make investments within Alaska, though such a stance has never really gained momentum.
624	Starting in 1982, dividends from the fund's annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible Alaskans, ranging from an initial $1,000.00 in 1982 (equal to three years' payout, as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme) to $3,269.00 in 2008 (which included a one-time $1,200.00 "Resource Rebate").
624	Every year, the state legislature takes out 8 percent from the earnings, puts 3 percent back into the principal for inflation proofing, and the remaining 5 percent is distributed to all qualifying Alaskans.
624	To qualify for the Permanent Fund Dividend, one must have lived in the state for a minimum of 12 months, maintain constant residency subject to allowable absences, and not be subject to court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying classifications or may subject the payment amount to civil garnishment.
624	Cost of living The cost of goods in Alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous 48 states.
624	This has changed for the most part in Anchorage and to a lesser extent in Fairbanks, where the cost of living has dropped somewhat in the past five years.
624	Federal government employees, particularly United States Postal Service (USPS) workers and active-duty military members, receive a Cost of Living Allowance usually set at 25% of base pay because, while the cost of living has gone down, it is still one of the highest in the country.
624	The introduction of big-box stores in Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau also did much to lower prices.
624	Wal-Mart opened their first Anchorage store in 1993, and debuted in Fairbanks in 2004.
624	The company currently has locations covering most of the population centers of Alaska, including Juneau, Ketchikan and Kodiak.
624	However, rural Alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods, compared to the rest of the country due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure.
624	Many rural residents come into these cities and purchase food and goods in bulk from warehouse clubs like Costco and Sam's Club.
624	Some have embraced the free shipping offers of some online retailers to purchase items much more cheaply than they could in their own communities, if they are available at all.
624	Agriculture and fishing Due to the northern climate and short growing season, relatively little farming occurs in Alaska.
624	Most farms are in either the Matanuska Valley, about 40 mi northeast of Anchorage, or on the Kenai Peninsula, about 60 mi southwest of Anchorage.
624	The short 100-day growing season limits the crops that can be grown, but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons.
624	The primary crops are potatoes, carrots, lettuce, and cabbage.
624	The Tanana Valley is another notable agricultural locus, especially Delta Junction area, about 100 mi southeast of Fairbanks, with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops; these farms mostly lie north and east of Fort Greely.
624	This area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by Hammond during his second term as governor.
624	Delta-area crops consist predominately of barley and hay.
624	West of Fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants, the hotel and tourist industry, and community supported agriculture.
624	Alaskan agriculture has experienced a surge in growth of market gardeners, small farms and farmers' markets in recent years, with the highest percentage increase (46%) in the nation in growth in farmers' markets in 2011, compared to 17% nationwide.
624	The peony industry has also taken off, as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a gap in supply elsewhere in the world, thereby filling a niche in the flower market.
624	Alaska, with no counties, also lacks county fairs.
624	However, a small assortment of state and local fairs (with the Alaska State Fair in Palmer the largest), are held mostly in the late summer.
624	The fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity, and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more high-profile commercial activities such as carnival rides, concerts and food.
624	"Alaska Grown" is used as an agricultural slogan.
624	Alaska has an abundance of seafood, with the primary fisheries in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific, and seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it.
624	Many Alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence, as well as sport.
624	This includes fish taken by hook, net or wheel.
624	Hunting for subsistence, primarily caribou, moose, and Dall sheep is sno}}<till common in the state, particularly in remote Bush communities.
624	An example of a traditional native food is Akutaq, the Eskimo ice cream, which can consist of reindeer fat, seal oil, dried fish meat and local berries.
624	Alaska's reindeer herding is concentrated on Seward Peninsula where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with the domesticated reindeer.
624	Most food in Alaska is transported into the state from "Outside", and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive.
624	In rural areas, subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive.
624	The cost of importing food to villages begins at 7¢ per pound (15¢/kg) and rises rapidly to 50¢ per pound ($1.10/kg) or more.
624	The cost of delivering a 1 USgal of milk is about $3.50 in many villages where per capita income can be $20,000 or less.
624	Fuel cost can exceed $8.00 per gallon.
624	Transportation Roads Alaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the U.S.
624	The state's road system covers a relatively small area of the state, linking the central population centers and the Alaska Highway, the principal route out of the state through Canada.
624	The state capital, Juneau, is not accessible by road, only a car ferry, which has spurred several debates over the decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system, or building a road connection from Haines.
624	The western part of Alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of Alaska.
624	One unique feature of the Alaska Highway system is the Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel, an active Alaska Railroad tunnel recently upgraded to provide a paved roadway link with the isolated community of Whittier on Prince William Sound to the Seward Highway about 50 mi southeast of Anchorage at Portage.
624	At  the tunnel was the longest road tunnel in North America until 2007.
624	The tunnel is the longest combination road and rail tunnel in North America.
624	Rail Built around 1915, the Alaska Railroad (ARR) played a key role in the development of Alaska through the 20th century.
624	It links north Pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from Seward to Interior Alaska by way of South Central Alaska, passing through Anchorage, Eklutna, Wasilla, Talkeetna, Denali, and Fairbanks, with spurs to Whittier, Palmer and North Pole.
624	The cities, towns, villages, and region served by ARR tracks are known statewide as "The Railbelt".
624	In recent years, the ever-improving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroad's importance in Alaska's economy.
624	The railroad, though famed for its summertime tour passenger service, played a vital role in Alaska's development, moving freight into Alaska while transporting natural resources southward (i.e., coal from the Usibelli coal mine near Healy to Seward and gravel from the Matanuska Valley to Anchorage).
624	The Alaska Railroad was one of the last railroads in North America to use cabooses in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains.
624	It continues to offer one of the last flag stop routes in the country.
624	A stretch of about 60 mi of track along an area north of Talkeetna remains inaccessible by road; the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area; until construction of the Parks Highway in the 1970s, the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route.
624	In northern Southeast Alaska, the White Pass and Yukon Route also partly runs through the state from Skagway northwards into Canada (British Columbia and Yukon Territory), crossing the border at White Pass Summit.
624	This line is now mainly used by tourists, often arriving by cruise liner at Skagway.
624	It featured in the 1983 BBC television series Great Little Railways.
624	The Alaska Rail network is not connected to Outside.
624	In 2000, the U.S.
624	Congress authorized $6 million to study the feasibility of a rail link between Alaska, Canada, and the lower 48.
624	Alaska Rail Marine provides car float service between Whittier and Seattle.
624	Marine transport Many cities, towns and villages in the state do not have road or highway access; the only modes of access involve travel by air, river, or the sea.
624	Alaska's well-developed state-owned ferry system (known as the Alaska Marine Highway) serves the cities of southeast, the Gulf Coast and the Alaska Peninsula.
624	The ferries transport vehicles as well as passengers.
624	The system also operates a ferry service from Bellingham, Washington and Prince Rupert, British Columbia in Canada through the Inside Passage to Skagway.
624	The Inter-Island Ferry Authority also serves as an important marine link for many communities in the Prince of Wales Island region of Southeast and works in concert with the Alaska Marine Highway.
624	In recent years, cruise lines have created a summertime tourism market, mainly connecting the Pacific Northwest to Southeast Alaska and, to a lesser degree, towns along Alaska's gulf coast.
624	The population of Ketchikan may rise by over 10,000 people on many days during the summer, as up to four large cruise ships at a time can dock, debarking thousands of passengers.
624	Air transport Cities not served by road, sea, or river can be reached only by air, foot, dogsled, or snowmachine accounting for Alaska's extremely well developed bush air services—an Alaskan novelty.
624	Anchorage itself, and to a lesser extent Fairbanks, are served by many majonks, are servr airlines.
624	Because of limited highway access, air travel remains the most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state.
624	Anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism (in 2000–2001, the latest year for which data is available, 2.4 million total arrivals to Alaska were counted, 1.7 million by air travel; 1.4 million were visitors).
624	Regular flights to most villages and towns within the state that are commercially viable are challenging to provide, so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government through the Essential Air Service program.
624	Alaska Airlines is the only major airline offering in-state travel with jet service (sometimes in combination cargo and passenger Boeing 737-400s) from Anchorage and Fairbanks to regional hubs like Bethel, Nome, Kotzebue, Dillingham, Kodiak, and other larger communities as well as to major Southeast and Alaska Peninsula communities.
624	The bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as Era Aviation, PenAir, and Frontier Flying Service.
624	The smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the Cessna Caravan, the most popular aircraft in use in the state.
624	Much of this service can be attributed to the Alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to Alaskan rural communities.
624	The program requires 70% of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities.
624	Many communities have small air taxi services.
624	These operations originated from the demand for customized transport to remote areas.
624	Perhaps the most quintessentially Alaskan plane is the bush seaplane.
624	The world's busiest seaplane base is Lake Hood, located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers, cargo, and many items from stores and warehouse clubs.
624	Alaska has the highest number of pilots per capita of any U.S.
624	Other transport Another Alaskan transportation method is the dogsled.
624	In modern times (that is, any time after the mid-late 1920s), dog mushing is more of a sport than a true means of transportation.
624	Various races are held around the state, but the best known is the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, a 1150-mile (1850 km) trail from Anchorage to Nome (although the distance varies from year to year, the official distance is set at 1049 mi).
624	The race commemorates the famous 1925 serum run to Nome in which mushers and dogs like Togo and Balto took much-needed medicine to the diphtheria-stricken community of Nome when all other means of transportation had failed.
624	Mushers from all over the world come to Anchorage each March to compete for cash, prizes, and prestige.
624	The "Serum Run" is another sled dog race that more accurately follows the route of the famous 1925 relay, leaving from the community of Nenana (southwest of Fairbanks) to Nome.
624	In areas not served by road or rail, primary transportation in summer is by all-terrain vehicle and in winter by snowmobile or "snow machine," as it is commonly referred to in Alaska.
624	Data transport Alaska's internet and other data transport systems are provided largely through the two major telecommunications companies: GCI and Alaska Communications.
624	GCI owns and operates what it calls the Alaska United Fiber Optic system and as of late 2011 Alaska Communications advertised that it has "two fiber optic paths to the lower 48 and two more across Alaska.
624	In January 2011, it was reported that a $1 billion project to run connect Asia and rural Alaska was being planned, aided in part by $350 million in stimulus from the federal government.
624	Law and government State government Like all other U.S.
624	Alaska is governed as a republic, with three branches of government: an executive branch consisting of the Governor of Alaska and the other independently elected constitutional officers; a legislative branch consisting of the Alaska House of Representatives and Alaska Senate; and a judicial branch consisting of the Alaska Supreme Court and lower courts.
624	The state of Alaska employs approximately 15,000 employees statewide.
624	The Alaska Legislature consists of a 40-member House of Representatives and a 20-member Senate.
624	Senators serve four-year terms and House members two.
624	The Governor of Alaska serves four-year terms.
624	The lieutenant governor runs separately from the governor in the primaries, but during the general election, the nominee for governor and nominee for lieutenant governor run together on the same ticket.
624	Alaska's court system has four levels: the Alaska Supreme Court, the court of appeals, the superior courts and the district courts.
624	The superior and district courts are trial courts.
624	Superior courts are courts of general jurisdiction, while district courts only hear certain types of cases, including misdemeanor crimial jurisdinal cases and civil cases valued up to $100,000.
624	The Supreme Court and the Court Of Appeals are appellate courts.
624	The Court Of Appeals is required to hear appeals from certain lower-court decisions, including those regarding criminal prosecutions, juvenile delinquency, and habeas corpus.
624	The Supreme Court hears civil appeals and may in its discretion hear criminal appeals.
624	State politics Although Alaska entered the union as a Democratic state, since the early 1970s Alaska has been characterized as a Republican-leaning state.
624	Local political communities have often worked on issues related to land use development, fishing, tourism, and individual rights.
624	Alaska Natives, while organized in and around their communities, have been active within the Native corporations.
624	These have been given ownership over large tracts of land, which require stewardship.
624	Alaska was formerly the only state in which possession of one ounce or less of marijuana in one's home was completely legal under state law, though the federal law remains in force.
624	The state has an independence movement favoring a vote on secession from the United States, with the Alaskan Independence Party.
624	Six Republicans and four Democrats have served as governor of Alaska.
624	In addition, Republican Governor Wally Hickel was elected to the office for a second term in 1990 after leaving the Republican party and briefly joining the Alaskan Independence Party ticket just long enough to be reelected.
624	He subsequently officially rejoined the Republican party in 1994.
624	Taxes To finance state government operations, Alaska depends primarily on petroleum revenues and federal subsidies.
624	This allows it to have the lowest individual tax burden in the United States, and be one of only five states with no state sales tax, one of seven states that do not levy an individual income tax, and one of two states that has neither.
624	The Department of Revenue Tax Division  reports regularly on the state's revenue sources.
624	The Department also issues an annual summary of its operations, including new state laws that directly affect the tax division.
624	While Alaska has no state sales tax, 89 municipalities collect a local sales tax, from 1–7.5%, typically 3–5%.
624	Other local taxes levied include raw fish taxes, hotel, motel, and bed-and-breakfast 'bed' taxes, severance taxes, liquor and tobacco taxes, gaming (pull tabs) taxes, tire taxes and fuel transfer taxes.
624	A part of the revenue collected from certain state taxes and license fees (such as petroleum, aviation motor fuel, telephone cooperative) is shared with municipalities in Alaska.
624	Fairbanks has one of the highest property taxes in the state as no sales or income taxes are assessed in the Fairbanks North Star Borough (FNSB).
624	A sales tax for the FNSB has been voted on many times, but has yet to be approved, leading law makers to increase taxes dramatically on other goods such as liquor and tobacco.
624	In 2008 the Tax Foundation ranked Alaska as having the 4th most "business friendly" tax policy.
624	More "friendly" states were Wyoming, Nevada, and South Dakota.
624	Federal politics In presidential elections, the state's electoral college votes have been won by the Republican nominee in every election since statehood, except for 1964.
624	No state has voted for a Democratic presidential candidate fewer times.
624	Alaska supported Democratic nominee Lyndon B.
624	Johnson in the landslide year of 1964, and the 1960 and 1968 elections were close.
624	Since 1972, however, Republicans have carried the state by large margins.
624	In 2008, Republican John McCain defeated Democrat Barack Obama in Alaska, 59.49% to 37.83%.
624	McCain's running mate was Sarah Palin, the state's governor and the first Alaskan on a major party ticket.
624	The Alaska Bush, central Juneau, midtown and downtown Anchorage, and the areas surrounding the University of Alaska Fairbanks campus and Ester have been strongholds of the Democratic Party.
624	The Matanuska-Susitna Borough, the majority of Fairbanks (including North Pole and the military base), and South Anchorage typically have the strongest Republican showing.
624	As of 2004, well over half of all registered voters have chosen "Non-Partisan" or "Undeclared" as their affiliation, despite recent attempts to close primaries.
624	Because of its population relative to other U.S.
624	Alaska has only one member in the U.S.
624	House of Representatives.
624	This seat is currently being held by Republican Don Young, who was re-elected to his 21st consecutive term in 2012.
624	Alaska's At-large congressional district is currently the world's second-largest legislative constituency by area, behind only the Canadian territory of Nunavut.
624	In 2008, Governor Sarah Palin became the first Republican woman to run on a national ticket when she became John McCain's Vice Presidential running mate.
624	She continued to be a prominent national figure even after resigning from the governor's job in July 2009.
624	Alaska's United States Senators belong to Class 2 and Class 3.
624	In 2008, Democrat Mark Begich, mayor of Anchorage, defeated long-time Republican senator Ted Stevens.
624	Stevens had been convicted on seven felony counts of failing to report gifts on Senate financial discloser forms one week before the election.
624	The conviction was set aside in April 2009 after evidence of prosecutorial misconduct emerged.
624	Republican Frank Murkowski held the state's other senatorial position.
624	After being elected governor in 2002, he resigned from the Senate and appointed his daughter, State Representative Lisa Murkowski as his successor.
624	She won a full six-year term in 2004 and 2010.
624	Cities, towns and boroughs Alaska is not divided into counties, as most of the other U.S.
624	Many of the more densely populated parts of the state are part of Alaska's 16 boroughs, which function somewhat similarly to counties in other states.
624	However, unlike county-equivalents in the other 49 states, the boroughs do not cover the entire land area of the state.
624	The area not part of any borough is referred to as the Unorganized Borough.
624	The Unorganized Borough has no government of its own, but the U.S.
624	Census Bureau in cooperation with the state divided the Unorganized Borough into 11 census areas solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation.
624	A recording district is a mechanism for administration of the public record in Alaska.
624	The state is divided into 34 recording districts which are centrally administered under a State Recorder.
624	All recording districts use the same acceptance criteria, fee schedule, etc., for accepting documents into the public record.
624	Whereas many U.S.
624	Alaska uses only two tiers—state/borough.
624	Owing to the low population density, most of the land is located in the Unorganized Borough which, as the name implies, has no intermediate borough government of its own, but is administered directly by the state government.
624	Currently (2000 census) 57.71% of Alaska's area has this status, with 13.05% of the population.
624	For statistical purposes the United States Census Bureau divides this territory into census areas.
624	Anchorage merged the city government with the Greater Anchorage Area Borough in 1975 to form the Municipality of Anchorage, containing the city proper and the communities of Eagle River, Chugiak, Peters Creek, Girdwood, Bird, and Indian.
624	Fairbanks has a separate borough (the Fairbanks North Star Borough) and municipality (the City of Fairbanks).
624	The state's most populous city is Anchorage, home to 278,700 people in 2006, 225,744 of whom live in the urbanized area.
624	The richest location in Alaska by per capita income is Halibut Cove ($89,895).
624	Yakutat City, Sitka, Juneau, and Anchorage are the four largest cities in the U.S.
624	Cities and census-designated places (by population) Alaska has a total of 355 cities and census-designated places.
624	The majority of these are located in the rural expanse of Alaska known as "The Bush" and are unccated in the ronnected to the contiguous North American road network.
624	The 100 largest cities and census-designated places in Alaska are listed below, in population order: : Key:  ---- Out of Alaska's 2010 Census population figure of 710,231, 20,429 people, or 2.88% of the population, do not live in an incorporated city or census-designated place.
624	Approximately 3/4 of that figure are people who live in urban and suburban neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city limits of Ketchikan, Kodiak, Palmer and Wasilla, in areas where census-designated places have not been created by the Census Bureau.
624	The remainder are scattered throughout Alaska, both within organized boroughs and in the Unorganized Borough.
624	Education The Alaska Department of Education and Early Development administers many school districts in Alaska.
624	In addition, the state operates a boarding school, Mt.
624	Edgecumbe High School in Sitka; and provides partial funding for other boarding schools, including Nenana Student Living Center in Nenana and The Galena Interior Learning Academy in Galena.
624	There are more than a dozen colleges and universities in Alaska.
624	Accredited universities in Alaska include the University of Alaska Anchorage, University of Alaska Fairbanks, University of Alaska Southeast, and Alaska Pacific University.
624	Alaska is the only state that has no institutions that are part of the NCAA Division I program.
624	The Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development operates AVTEC, Alaska's Institute of Technology.
624	Campuses in Seward and Anchorage offer 1 week to 11 month training programs in areas as diverse as Information Technology, Welding, Nursing, and Mechanics.
624	Alaska has had a problem with a "brain drain".
624	Many of its young people, including most of the highest academic achievers, leave the state after high school graduation and do not return.
624	The University of Alaska has attempted to combat this by offering partial four-year scholarships to the top 10% of Alaska high school graduates, via the Alaska Scholars Program.
624	Public health and public safety The Alaska State Troopers are Alaska's statewide police force.
624	They have a long and storied history, but were not an official organization until 1941.
624	Before the force was officially organized, law enforcement in Alaska was handled by various federal agencies.
624	Larger towns usually have their own local police and some villages rely on "Public Safety Officers" who have police training but do not carry firearms.
624	In much of the state, the troopers serve as the only police force available.
624	In addition to enforcing traffic and criminal law, wildlife Troopers enforce hunting and fishing regulations.
624	Due to the varied terrain and wide scope of the Troopers' duties, they employ a wide variety of land, air, and water patrol vehicles.
624	Many rural communities in Alaska are considered "dry," having outlawed the importation of alcoholic beverages.
624	Suicide rates for rural residents are higher than urban.
624	Domestic abuse and other violent crimes are also at high levels in the state; this is in part linked to alcohol abuse.
624	Alaska also has the highest rate of sexual assault in the nation.
624	The average age of sexually assaulted victims is 16 years old.
624	In four out of five cases, the suspects were relatives, friends or acquaintances.
624	Culture Some of Alaska's popular annual events are the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race that starts in Anchorage and ends in Nome, World Ice Art Championships in Fairbanks, the Alaska Hummingbird Festival in Ketchikan, the Sitka Whale Fest, and the Stikine River Garnet Fest in Wrangell.
624	The Stikine River features the largest springtime concentration of American Bald Eagles in the world.
624	The Alaska Native Heritage Center celebrates the rich heritage of Alaska's 11 cultural groups.
624	Their purpose is to enhance self-esteem among Native people and to encourage cross-cultural exchanges among all people.
624	The Alaska Native Arts Foundation promotes and markets Native art from all regions and cultures in the State, both on the internet; at its gallery in Anchorage, 500 West Sixth Avenue, and at the [http://www.alaskahouseny.org/index.aspx?ModuleID=1  Alaska House New York], 109 Mercer Street in SoHo.
624	Music Influences on music in Alaska include the traditional music of Alaska Natives as well as folk music brought by later immigrants from Russia and Europe.
624	Prominent musicians from Alaska include singer Jewel, traditional Aleut flautist Mary Youngblood, folk singer-songwriter Libby Roderick, Christian music singer/songwriter Lincoln Brewster, metal/post hardcore band 36 Crazyfists and the groups Pamyua and Portugal.
624	The Man.
624	There are many established music festivals in Alaska, including the Alaska Folk Festival, the Fairbanks Summer Arts Festival, the [http://anchoragefolkfestival.org/ Anchorage Folk Festival], the Athabascan Old-Time Fiddling Festival, the Sitka Jazz Festival, and the Sitka Summer Music Festival.
624	The most prominent orchestra in Alaska is the Anchorage Symphony Orchestra, though the Fairbanks Symphony Orchestra and Juneau Symphony are also notable.
624	The Anchorage Opera is currently the state's only professional opera company, though there are several volunteer and semi-professional organizations in the state as well.
624	The official state song of Alaska is "Alaska's Flag", which was adopted in 1955; it celebrates the flag of Alaska.
624	Alaska in film and on television Alaska's first independent picture all made on place was in the silent years.
624	The Chechahcos was produced by Alaskan businessman Austin E.
624	Lathrop and filmed in and around Anchorage.
624	It was released in 1924 by the Alaska Moving Picture Corporation and was the only film the company made.
624	One of the most prominent movies filmed in Alaska is MGM's Eskimo/Mala The Magnificent, starring Alaska Native Ray Mala.
624	In 1932 an expedition set out from MGM's studios in Hollywood to Alaska to film what was then billed as "The Biggest Picture Ever Made."
624	Upon arriving in Alaska, they set up "Camp Hollywood" in Northwest Alaska, where they lived during the duration of the filming.
624	Louis B.
624	Mayer spared no expense in spite of the remote location, going so far as to hire the chef from the Hotel Roosevelt in Hollywood to prepare meals.
624	When Eskimo premiered at the Astor Theatre in New York City, the studio received the largest amount of feedback in its history to that point.
624	Eskimo was critically acclaimed and released worldwide; as a result, Mala became an international movie star.
624	Eskimo won the first Oscar for Best Film Editing at the Academy Awards, and was also responsible for showcasing and preserving aspects of Inupiat culture on film.
624	The 1983 Disney movie Never Cry Wolf was at least partially shot in Alaska.
624	The 1991 film White Fang, starring Ethan Hawke, was filmed in and around Haines, Alaska.
624	Steven Seagal's 1994 On Deadly Ground, starring Michael Caine, was filmed in part at the Worthington Glacier near Valdez.
624	The 1999 John Sayles film Limbo, starring David Strathairn, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, and Kris Kristofferson, was filmed in Juneau.
624	The psychological thriller Insomnia, starring Al Pacino and Robin Williams, was shot in Canada, but was set in Alaska.
624	The 2007 film directed by Sean Penn, Into The Wild, was partially filmed and set in Alaska.
624	The film, which is based on the novel of the same name, follows the adventures of Christopher McCandless, who died in a remote abandoned bus along the Stampede Trail west of Healy in 1992.
624	Many films and television shows set in Alaska are not filmed there; for example, Northern Exposure, set in the fictional town of Cicely, Alaska, was actually filmed in Roslyn, Washington.
624	The 2007 horror feature 30 Days of Night is set in Barrow, but was filmed in New Zealand.
624	Many reality television shows are filmed in Alaska.
624	In 2011 the Anchorage Daily News found ten set in the state.
624	State symbols * State Motto: North to the Future * Nicknames: "The Last Frontier" or "Land of the Midnight Sun" or "Seward's Icebox" * State bird: Willow Ptarmigan, adopted by the Territorial Legislature in 1955.
624	It is a small (15–17 inches) Arctic grouse that lives among willows and on open tundra and muskeg.
624	Plumage is brown in summer, changing to white in winter.
624	The Willow Ptarmigan is common in much of Alaska.
624	State fish: King Salmon, adopted 1962.
624	State flower: wild/native Forget-me-not, adopted by the Territorial Legislature in 1917.
624	It is a perennial that is found throughout Alaska, from Hyder to the Arctic Coast, and west to the Aleutians.
624	State fossil: Woolly Mammoth, adopted 1986.
624	State gem: Jade, adopted 1968.

624	State tree: Sitka Spruce, adopted 1962.
624	State dog:  Alaskan Malamute, adopted 2010.
624	State soil: Tanana, adopted unknown.
624	Alaska Heritage Resources Survey The Alaska Heritage Resources Survey (AHRS) is a restricted inventory of all reported historic and prehistoric sites within the state of Alaska and is maintained by the Office of History and Archaeology.
624	The survey's inventory of cultural resources includes objects, structures, buildings, sites, districts, and travel ways, with a general provision that they are over 50 years old.
624	As of January 31, 2012 over 35,000 sites have been reported.
627	Agriculture, also called farming or husbandry, is the cultivation of animals, plants, fungi, and other life forms for food, fiber, biofuel and other products used to sustain human life.
627	Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that nurtured the development of civilization.
627	The study of agriculture is known as agricultural science.
627	Agriculture generally speaking refers to human activities, although it is also observed in certain species of ant and termite.
627	The word agriculture is the English adaptation of Latin agricultūra, from ager, ref> The word agricultu"a field", and cultūra, "cultivation" in the strict sense of "tillage of the soil".
627	Thus, a literal reading of the word yields "tillage of fields".
627	The history of agriculture dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climates, cultures, and technologies.
627	However, all farming generally relies on techniques to expand and maintain the lands that are suitable for raising domesticated species.
627	For plants, this usually requires some form of irrigation, although there are methods of dryland farming; pastoral herding on rangeland is still the most common means of raising livestock.
627	In the developed world, industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture has become the dominant system of modern farming, although there is growing support for sustainable agriculture (e.g.
627	Until the Industrial Revolution, the vast majority of the human population labored in agriculture.
627	Pre-industrial agriculture was typically subsistence agriculture in which farmers raised most of their crops for their own consumption instead of for trade.
627	A remarkable shift in agricultural practices has occurred over the past century in response to new technologies, and the development of world markets.
627	This also led to technological improvements in agricultural techniques, such as the Haber-Bosch method for synthesizing ammonium nitrate which made the traditional practice of recycling nutrients with crop rotation and animal manure less necessary.
627	Modern agronomy, plant breeding, and agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers, and technological improvements have sharply increased yields from cultivation, but at the same time have caused widespread ecological damage and negative human health effects.
627	Selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry such as intensive pig farming have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about animal cruelty and the health effects of the antibiotics, growth hormones, and other chemicals commonly used in industrial meat production.
627	The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, fuels, and raw materials.
627	In the 21st century, plants have been used to grow biofuels, biopharmaceuticals, bioplastics, and pharmaceuticals.
627	Specific foods include cereals, vegetables, fruits, and meat.
627	Fibers include cotton, wool, hemp, silk and flax.
627	Raw materials include lumber and bamboo.
627	Other useful materials are produced by plants, such as resins.
627	Biofuels include methane from biomass, ethanol, and biodiesel.
627	Cut flowers, nursery plants, tropical fish and birds for the pet trade are some of the ornamental products.
627	Regarding food production, the World Bank targets agricultural food production and water management as an increasingly global issue that is fostering an important and growing debate.
627	In 2007, one third of the world's workers were employed in agriculture.
627	The services sector has overtaken agriculture as the economic sector employing the most people worldwide.
627	Despite the size of its workforce, agricultural production accounts for less than five percent of the gross world product (an aggregate of all gross domestic products).
627	History  Agricultural practices such as irrigation, crop rotation, fertilizers, pesticides and animals were developed long ago, but have made great strides in the past century.
627	The history of agriculture has played a major role in human history, as agricultural progress has been a crucial factor in worldwide socio-economic change.
627	Division of labor in agricultural societies made commonplace specializations rarely seen in hunter-gatherer cultures.
627	So, too, are arts such as epic literature and monumental architecture, as well as codified legal systems.
627	When farmers became capable of producing food beyond the needs of their own families, others in their society were freed to devote themselves to projects other than food acquisition.
627	Historians and anthropologists have long argued that the development of agriculture made civilization possible.
627	The total world population probably never exceeded 15 million inhabitants before the development of agriculture.
627	Prehistoric origins  Forest gardening, a plant-based food production system, is thought to be the world's oldest agroecosystem.
627	Forest gardens originated in prehistoric times along jungle-clad river banks and in the wet foothills of monsoon regions.
627	In the gradual process of a family improving their immediate environment, useful tree and vine species were identified, protected and improved whilst undesirable species were eliminated.
627	Eventually superior foreign species were selected and incorporated into the family's garden.
627	Ancient history  The|isbn=978-9 Fertile Crescent of Western Asia, Egypt, and India were sites of the earliest planned sowing and harvesting of plants that had previously been gathered in the wild.
627	Independent development of agriculture occurred in northern and southern China, Africa's Sahel, New Guinea and several regions of America.
627	The eight so-called Neolithic founder crops of agriculture appear: first emmer wheat and einkorn wheat, then hulled barley, peas, lentils, bitter vetch, chick peas and flax.
627	By 7000 BC, small-scale agriculture reached Egypt.
627	From at least 7000 BC the Indian subcontinent saw farming of wheat and barley, as attested by archaeological excavation at Mehrgarh in Balochistan in what is present day Pakistan.
627	By 6000 BC, mid-scale farming was entrenched on the banks of the Nile.
627	This, as irrigation had not yet matured sufficiently.
627	About this time, agriculture was developed independently in the Far East, with rice, rather than wheat, as the primary crop.
627	Chinese and Indonesian farmers went on to domesticate taro and beans including mung, soy and azuki.
627	To complement these new sources of carbohydrates, highly organized net fishing of rivers, lakes and ocean shores in these areas brought in great volumes of essential protein.
627	Collectively, these new methods of farming and fishing inaugurated a human population boom that dwarfed all previous expansions and continues today.
627	By 5000 BC, the Sumerians had developed core agricultural techniques including large-scale intensive cultivation of land, monocropping, organized irrigation, and the use of a specialized labor force.
627	Domestication of wild aurochs and mouflon into cattle and sheep, respectively, ushered in the large-scale use of animals for food/fiber and as beasts of burden.
627	The shepherd joined the farmer as an essential provider for sedentary and seminomadic societies.
627	Maize, manioc, and arrowroot were first domesticated in America as far back as 5200 BC.
627	The potato, tomato, pepper, squash, several varieties of bean, tobacco, and several other plants were also developed in America, as was extensive terracing of steep hillsides in much of Andean South America.
627	The Greeks and Romans built on techniques pioneered by the Sumerians, but made few fundamentally new advances.
627	Southern Greeks struggled with very poor soils, yet managed to become a dominant society for years.
627	The Romans were noted for an emphasis on the cultivation of crops for trade.
627	In the same region, a parallel agricultural revolution occurred, resulting in some of the most important crops grown today.
627	In Mesoamerica wild teosinte was transformed through human selection into the ancestor of modern maize, more than 6000 years ago.
627	It gradually spread across North America and was the major crop of Native Americans at the time of European exploration.
627	Other Mesoamerican crops include hundreds of varieties of squash and beans.
627	Cocoa was also a major crop domesticated in Mexico and Central America.
627	The turkey, one of the most important meat birds, was probably domesticated in Mexico.
627	In the Andes region of South America the major domesticated crop was potatoes, domesticated perhaps 5000 years ago.
627	Large varieties of beans were domesticated, in South America, as well as animals, including llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs.
627	Coca, still a major crop, was also domesticated in the Andes.
627	A minor center of domestication, the indigenous people of the Eastern U.S.
627	Sunflowers, tobacco, varieties of squash and Chenopodium, as well as crops no longer grown, including marshelder and little barley were domesticated.
627	Other wild foods may have undergone some selective cultivation, including wild rice and maple sugar.
627	The most common varieties of strawberry were domesticated from Eastern North America.
627	By 3500 BC, the simplest form of the plough was developed, called the ard.
627	Before this period, simple digging sticks or hoes were used.
627	These tools would have also been easier to transport, which was a benefit as people only stayed until the soil's nutrients were depleted.
627	However, through excavations in Mexico it has been found that the continuous cultivating of smaller pieces of land would also have been a sustaining practice.
627	Additional research in central Europe later revealed that agriculture was indeed practiced at this method.
627	For this method, ards were thus much more efficient than digging sticks.
627	Middle Ages  The Middle Ages saw significant improvements in the agricultural techniques and technology.
627	There was a steady clearing of woodlands and draining of wetlands for the increase of cropland throughout the period until about the year 1300.
627	Tools such as axes, adzes, and bill-hooks were improved, but most significant was the gradual evolution of the scratch plough from the classical Mediterranean world into the mouldboard plough capable of turning over the heavy soils of northern Europe.
627	The period saw a general move from a two field crop rotation to a three field crop rotation in which one field of three was left fallow every year.
627	Also, there was a general change from small patchworks of fields to one large open field divided into strips owned by various members of a community.
627	The use of watermills was common in the Middle Ages.
627	There was tremendous increase in windmills from the 12th to the 13th century; some tens of thousands were built.
627	Crops were wheat, rye, barley, and oats.
627	Peas, beans, and vetches became common from the 13th century onward as a fodder crop for animals and also for their nitrogen-fixation fertilizing properties.
627	Crop yields peaked in the 13th century, and according to Bruce Campbell and Mark Overton stayed more or less steady until the 18th century.
627	Though the limitations of Medieval farming were once thought to have provided a ceiling for the population growth in the Middle Ages, recent studies by Campbell and David Stone have shown that the technology of Medieval agriculture was always sufficient for the needs of the people under normal circumstances, and that it was only during exceptionally harsh times, such as the terrible weather of 1315–17, that the needs of the population could not be met.
627	Modern developments  After 1492, a global exchange of previously local crops and livestock breeds occurred.
627	Key crops involved in this exchange included the tomato, maize, potato, manioc, cocoa bean and tobacco going from the New World to the Old, and several varieties of wheat, spices, coffee, and sugar cane going from the Old World to the New.
627	The most important animal exportation from the Old World to the New were those of the horse and dog (dogs were already present in the pre-Columbian Americas but not in the numbers and breeds suited to farm work).
627	Although not usually food animals, the horse (including donkeys and ponies) and dog quickly filled essential production roles on western-hemisphere farms.
627	The potato became an important staple crop in northern Europe.
627	Since being introduced by Portuguese in the 16th century, maize and manioc have replaced traditional African crops as the continent's most important staple food crops.
627	By the early 19th century, agricultural techniques, implements, seed stocks and cultivar had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in the Middle Ages.
627	Although there is a vast and interesting history of crop cultivation before the dawn of the 20th century, there is little question that the work of Charles Darwin and Gregor Mendel created the scientific foundation for plant breeding that led to its explosive impact over the past 150 years.
627	With the rapid rise of mechanization in the late 19th century and the 20th century, particularly in the form of the tractor, farming tasks could be done with a speed and on a scale previously impossible.
627	These advances have led to efficiencies enabling certain modern farms in the United States, Argentina, Israel, the United Kingdom, Germany, and a few other nations to output volumes of high-quality produce per land unit at what may be the practical limit.
627	The Haber-Bosch method for synthesizing ammonium nitrate represented a major breakthrough and allowed crop yields to overcome previous constraints.
627	In the past century agriculture has been characterized by enhanced productivity, the substitution of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labor, water pollution, and farm subsidies.
627	In recent years there has been a backlash against the external environmental effects of conventional agriculture, resulting in the organic movement.
627	The cereals rice, corn, and wheat provide 60% of human food supply.
627	Between 1700 and 1980, "the total area of cultivated land worldwide increased 466%" and yields increased dramatically, particularly because of selectively bred high-yielding varieties, fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation, and machinery.
627	For example, irrigation increased corn yields in eastern Colorado by 400 to 500% from 1940 to 1997.
627	However, concerns have been raised over the sustainability of intensive agriculture.
627	Intensive agriculture has become associated with decreased soil quality in India and Asia, and there has been increased concern over the effects of fertilizers and pesticides on the environment, particularly as population increases and food demand expands.
627	The monocultures typically used in intensive agriculture increase the number of pests, which are controlled through pesticides.
627	Integrated pest management (IPM), which "has been promoted for decades and has had some notable successes" has not significantly affected the use of pesticides because policies encourage the use of pesticides and IPM is knowledge-intensive.
627	Agricultural exploration expeditions, since the late 19th century, have been mounted to find new species and new agricultural practices in different areas of the world.
627	Two early examples of expeditions include Frank N.
627	Meyer's fruit- and nut-collecting trip to China and Japan from 1916 to 1918 and the Dorsett-Morse Oriental Agricultural Exploration Expedition to China, Japan, and Korea from 1929–1931 to collect soybean germplasm to support the rise in soybean agriculture in the United States.
627	Green Revolution  The Green Revolution refers to a series of research, development, and technology transfer initiatives, occurring between the 1940s and the late 1970s, that increased agriculture production around the world, beginning most markedly in the late 1960s.
627	The initiatives, led by Norman Borlaug, the "Father of the Green Revolution" credited with saving over a billion people from starvation, involved the development of high-yielding varieties of cereal grains, expansion of irrigation infrastructure, modernization of management techniques, distribution of hybridized seeds, synthetic fertilizers, and pesticides to farmers.
627	Synthetic nitrogen, along with mined rock phosphate, pesticides and mechanization, have greatly increased crop yields in the early 20th century.
627	Increased supply of grains has led to cheaper livestock as well.
627	Further, global yield increases were experienced later in the 20th century when high-yield varieties of common staple grains such as rice, wheat, and corn (maize) were introduced as a part of the Green Revolution.
627	The Green Revolution exported the technologies (including pesticides and synthetic nitrogen) of the developed world to the developing world.
627	Thomas Malthus famously predicted that the Earth would not be able to support its growing population, but technologies such as the Green Revolution have allowed the world to produce a surplus of food.
627	Although the "Green Revolution" significantly increased rice yields in Asia, yield increases have not occurred in the past 15–20 years.
627	The genetic "yield potential" has increased for wheat, but the yield potential for rice has not increased since 1966, and the yield potential for maize has "barely increased in 35 years".
627	It takes a decade or two for herbicide-resistant weeds to emerge, and insects become resistant to insecticides within about a decade.
627	Crop rotation helps to prevent resistances.
627	Contemporary agriculture  In the past century agriculture has been characterized by enhanced productivity, the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, selective breeding, mechanization, water contamination, and farm subsidies.
627	Proponents of organic farming such as Sir Albert Howard argued in the early 20th century that the overuse of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers damages the long-term fertility of the soil.
627	While this feeling lay dormant for decades, as environmental awareness has increased in the 21st century there has been a movement towards sustainable agriculture by some farmers, consumers, and policymakers.
627	In recent years there has been a backlash against perceived external environmental effects of mainstream agriculture, particularly regarding water pollution, resulting in the organic movement.
627	One of the major forces behind this movement has been the European Union, which first certified organic food in 1991 and began reform of its Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in 2005 to phase out commodity-linked farm subsidies, also known as decoupling.
627	The growth of organic farming has renewed research in alternative technologies such as integrated pest management and selective breeding.
627	Recent mainstream technological developments include genetically modified food.
627	In late 2007, several factors pushed up the price of grains consumed by humans as well as used to feed poultry and dairy cows and other cattle, causing higher prices of wheat (up 58%), soybean (up 32%), and maize (up 11%) over the year.
627	Food riots took place in several countries across the world.
627	Contributing factors included drought in Australia and elsewhere, increasing demand for grain-fed animal products from the growing middle classes of countries such as China and India, diversion of foodgrain to biofuel production and trade restrictions imposed by several countries.
627	An epidemic of stem rust on wheat caused by race Ug99 is currently spreading across Africa and into Asia and is causing major concern.
627	Approximately 40% of the world's agricultural land is seriously degraded.
627	In Africa, if current trends of soil degradation continue, the continent might be able to feed just 25% of its population by 2025, according to UNU's Ghana-based Institute for Natural Resources in Africa.
627	In 2009, the agricultural output of China was the largest in the world, followed by the European Union, India and the United States, according to the International Monetary Fund (see below).
627	Economists measure the total factor productivity of agriculture and by this measure agriculture in the United States is roughly 2.6 times more productive than it was in 1948.
627	Six countries – the US, Canada, France, Australia, Argentina and Thailand – supply 90% of grain exports.
627	Water deficits, which are already spurring heavy grain imports in numerous middle-sized countries, including Algeria, Iran, Egypt, and Mexico, may soon do the same in larger countries, such as China or India.
627	Many governments have subsidized agriculture for a variety of political and economic reasons.
627	These agricultural subsidies are often linked to the production of certain commodities such as wheat, corn (maize), rice, soybeans, and milk.
627	The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) leads international efforts to defeat hunger and provides a neutral forum where nations meet as equals to negotiate agreements and debate food policy and the regulation of agriculture.
627	According to Dr.
627	Samuel Jutzi, director of FAO's animal production and health division, lobbying by "powerful" big food corporations has stopped reforms that would improve human health and the environment.
627	The "real, true issues are not being addressed by the political process because of the influence of lobbyists, of the true powerful entities," he said, speaking at the Compassion in World Farming annual forum.
627	For example, recent proposals for a voluntary code of conduct for the livestock industry that would have provided incentives for improving standards for health, and environmental regulations, such as the number of animals an area of land can support without long-term damage, were successfully defeated due to large food company pressure.
627	Agricultural safety  Agriculture remains a hazardous industry, and farmers worldwide remain at high risk of work-related injuries, lung disease, noise-induced hearing loss, skin diseases, as well as certain cancers related to chemical use and prolonged sun exposure.
627	On industrialized farms, injuries frequently involve the use of agricultural machinery.
627	The most common cause of fatal agricultural injuries in the United States is tractor rollovers, which can be prevented by the use of roll over protection structures which limit the risk of injury in case a tractor rolls over.
627	Pesticides and other chemicals used in farming can also be hazardous to worker health, and workers exposed to pesticides may experience illnesses or birth defects.
627	As an industry in which families commonly share in work and live on the farm itself, entire families can be at risk for injuries, illness, and death.
627	Agriculture is an especially dangerous industry for younger workers, accounting for nearly half of work-related fatalities in the United States between 1992 and 2000.
627	Common causes of fatal injuries among young farm worker include drowning, machinery and motor vehicle-related accidents.
627	To reduce the extent of farm-related youth injuries, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation have issued a set of guidelines known as [http://www.nagcat.org/nagcat/?page=guideline_search the North American Guidelines for Children's Agricultural Tasks (NAGCAT)] based on child development principles that matched children's abilities with the requirements of specific farm work.
627	These guidelines have proven effective at reducing work-related injury rates among youth, based on the results of a randomized control trial conducted by NIOSH.
627	Agricultural production systems  Crop cultivations systems  Cropping systems vary among farms depending on the available resources and constraints; geography and climate of the farm; government policy; economic, social and political pressures; and the philosophy and culture of the farmer.
627	Shifting cultivation (or slash and burn) is a system in which forests are burnt, releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and then perennial crops for a peing nutrients riod of several years.
627	Then the plot is left fallow to regrow forest, and the farmer moves to a new plot, returning after many more years (10–20).
627	This fallow period is shortened if population density grows, requiring the input of nutrients (fertilizer or manure) and some manual pest control.
627	Annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no fallow period.
627	This requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs.
627	Further industrialization lead to the use of monocultures, when one cultivar is planted on a large acreage.
627	Because of the low biodiversity, nutrient use is uniform and pests tend to build up, necessitating the greater use of pesticides and fertilizers.
627	Multiple cropping, in which several crops are grown sequentially in one year, and intercropping, when several crops are grown at the same time are other kinds of annual cropping systems known as polycultures.
627	In subtropical and arid environments, the timing and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall, either not allowing multiple annual crops in a year, or requiring irrigation.
627	In all of these environments perennial crops are grown (coffee, chocolate) and systems are practiced such as agroforestry.
627	In temperate environments, where ecosystems were predominantly grassland or prairie, highly productive annual cropping is the dominant farming system.
627	The last century has seen the intensification, concentration and specialization of agriculture, relying upon new technologies of agricultural chemicals (fertilizers and pesticides), mechanization, and plant breeding (hybrids and GMO's).
627	In the past few decades, a move towards sustainability in agriculture has also developed, integrating ideas of socio-economic justice and conservation of resources and the environment within a farming system.
627	This has led to the development of many responses to the conventional agriculture approach, including organic agriculture, urban agriculture, community supported agriculture, ecological or biological agriculture, integrated farming and holistic management, as well as an increased trend towards agricultural diversification.
627	Crop statistics  Important categories of crops include grains and pseudograins, pulses (legumes), forage, and fruits and vegetables.
627	Specific crops are cultivated in distinct growing regions throughout the world.
627	In millions of metric tons, based on FAO estimate.
627	Livestock production systems  Animals, including horses, mules, oxen, camels, llamas, alpacas, and dogs, are often used to help cultivate fields, harvest crops, wrangle other animals, and transport farm products to buyers.
627	Animal husbandry not only refers to the breeding and raising of animals for meat or to harvest animal products (like milk, eggs, or wool) on a continual basis, but also to the breeding and care of species for work and companionship.
627	Livestock production systems can be defined based on feed source, as grassland – based, mixed, and landless.
627	Grassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such as shrubland, rangeland, and pastures for feeding ruminant animals.
627	Outside nutrient inputs may be used, however manure is returned directly to the grassland as a major nutrient source.
627	This system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil, representing 30–40 million pastoralists.
627	Mixed production systems use grassland, fodder crops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and monogastic (one stomach; mainly chickens and pigs) livestock.
627	Manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops.
627	Approximately 68% of all agricultural land is permanent pastures used in the production of livestock.
627	Landless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm, representing the de-linking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in OECD member countries.
627	In the U.S., 70% of the grain grown is fed to animals on feedlots.
627	Synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure utilization becomes a challenge as well as a source for pollied upon for croplution.
627	Production practices  Tillage is the practice of plowing soil to prepare for planting or for nutrient incorporation or for pest control.
627	Tillage varies in intensity from conventional to no-till.
627	It may improve productivity by warming the soil, incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds, but also renders soil more prone to erosion, triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing CO2, and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organisms.
627	Pest control includes the management of weeds, insects/mites, and diseases.
627	Chemical (pesticides), biological (biocontrol), mechanical (tillage), and cultural practices are used.
627	Cultural practices include crop rotation, culling, cover crops, intercropping, composting, avoidance, and resistance.
627	Integrated pest management attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss, and recommends pesticides as a last resort.
627	Nutrient management includes both the source of nutrient inputs for crop and livestock production, and the method of utilization of manure produced by livestock.
627	Nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic fertilizers, manure, green manure, compost and mined minerals.
627	Crop nutrient use may also be managed using cultural techniques such as crop rotation or a fallow period.
627	Manure is used either by holding livestock where the feed crop is growing, such as in managed intensive rotational grazing, or by spreading either dry or liquid formulations of manure on cropland or pastures.
627	Water management is where rainfall is insufficient or variable, which occurs to some degree in most regions of the world.
627	Some farmers use irrigation to supplement rainfall.
627	In other areas such as the Great Plains in the U.S.
627	Canada, farmers use a fallow year to conserve soil moisture to use for growing a crop in the following year.
627	Agriculture represents 70% of freshwater use worldwide.
627	Processing, distribution, and marketing  In the United States, food costs attributed to processing, distribution, and marketing have risen while the costs attributed to farming have declined.
627	This is related to the greater efficiency of farming, combined with the increased level of value addition (e.g.
627	From 1960 to 1980 the farm share was around 40%, but by 1990 it had declined to 30% and by 1998, 22.2%.
627	Market concentration has increased in the sector as well, with the top 20 food manufacturers accounting for half the food-processing value in 1995, over double that produced in 1954.
627	As of 2000 the top six US supermarket groups had 50% of sales compared to 32% in 1992.
627	Although the total effect of the increased market concentration is likely increased efficiency, the changes redistribute economic surplus from producers (farmers) and consumers, and may have negative implications for rural communities.
627	Crop alteration and biotechnology  Crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years, since the beginning of civilization.
627	Altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic make-up of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans, for example, larger fruits or seeds, drought-tolerance, or resistance to pests.
627	Significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist Gregor Mendel.
627	His work on dominant and recessive alleles gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and brought great insights to the techniques utilized by plant breeders.
627	Crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits, self-pollination and cross-pollination, and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism.
627	Domestication of plants has, over the centuries increased yield, improved disease resistance and drought tolerance, eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants.
627	Careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants.
627	Plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved pasture (grasses and clover) in New Zealand.
627	Extensive X-ray and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts (i.e.
627	The Green Revolution popularized the use of conventional hybridization to increase yield many folds by creating "high-yielding varieties".
627	For example, average yields of corn (maize) in the USA have increased from around 2.5 tons per hectare (t/ha) (40 bushels per acre) in 1900 to about 9.4 t/ha (150 bushels per acre) in 2001.
627	Similarly, worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 t/ha in 1900 to more than 2.5 t/ha in 1990.
627	South American average wheat yields are around 2 t/ha, African under 1 t/ha, Egypt and Arabia up to 3.5 to 4 t/ha with irrigation.
627	In contrast, the average wheat yield in countries such as France is over 8 t/ha.
627	Variations in yields are due mainly to variation in climate, genetics, and the level of intensive farming techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical pest control, growth control to avoid lodging).
627	Genetic engineering  Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology.
627	Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops.
627	After mechanical tomato-harvesters were developed in the early 1960s, agricultural scientists genetically modified tomatoes to be more resistant to mechanical handling.
627	More recently, genetic engineering is being employed in various parts of the world, to create crops with other beneficial traits.
627	New research on woodland strawberry genome was found to be short and easy to manipulate.
627	Researchers now have tools to improve strawberry flavors and aromas of cultivated strawberries as stated in a publication by Nature Genetics.
627	Herbicide-tolerant GMO crops  Roundup Ready seed has a herbicide resistant gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to glyphosate.
627	Roundup is a trade name for a glyphosate-based product, which is a systemic, nonselective herbicide used to kill weeds.
627	Roundup Ready seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with glyphosate to control weeds without harming the resistant crop.
627	Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide.
627	Today, 92% of soybean acreage in the US is planted with genetically modified herbicide-tolerant plants.
627	With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays.
627	In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides.
627	Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.
627	Insect-resistant GMO crops  Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects.
627	These crops protect plants from damage by insects; one such crop is Starlink.
627	Another is cotton, which accounts for 63% of US cotton acreage.
627	Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination with wild species.
627	In some cases, wild species are the primary source of resistance traits; some tomato cultivars that have gained resistance to at least 19 diseases did so through crossing with wild populations of tomatoes.
627	Costs and benefits of GMOs  Genetic engineers may someday develop transgenic plants which would allow for irrigation, drainage, conservation, sanitary engineering, and maintaining or increasing yields while requiring fewer fossil fuel derived inputs than conventional crops.
627	Such developments would be particularly important in areas which are normally arid and rely upon constant irrigation, and on large scale farms.
627	However, genetic engineering of plants has proven to be controversial.
627	Many issues surrounding food security and environmental impacts have risen regarding GMO practices.
627	For example, GMOs are questioned by some ecologists and economists concerned with GMO practices such as terminator seeds, which is a genetic modification that creates sterile seeds.
627	Terminator seeds are currently under strong international opposition and face continual efforts of global bans.
627	Another controversial issue is the patent protection given to companies that develop new types of seed using genetic engineering.
627	Since companies have intellectual ownership of their seeds, they have the power to dictate terms and conditions of their patented product.
627	Currently, ten seed companies control over two-thirds of the global seed sales.
627	Vandana Shiva argues that these companies are guilty of biopiracy by patenting life and exploiting organisms for profit Farmers using patented seed are restricted from saving seed for subsequent plantings, which forces farmers to buy new seed every year.
627	Since seed saving is a traditional practice for many farmers in both developing and developed countries, GMO seeds legally bind farmers to change their seed saving practices to buying new seed every year.
627	Locally adapted seeds are an essential heritage that has the potential to be lost with current hybridized crops and GMOs.
627	Locally adapted seeds, also called land races or crop eco-types, are important because they have adapted over time to the specific micro-climates, soils, other environmental conditions, field designs, and ethnic preference indigenous to the exact area of cultivation.
627	Introducing GMOs and hybridized commercial seed to an area brings the risk of cross-pollination with local land races Therefore, GMOs pose a threat to the sustainability of land races and the ethnic heritage of cultures.
627	Once seed contains transgenic material, it becomes subject to the conditions of the seed company that owns the patent of the transgenic material.
627	GMO regulation  Food security issues also coincide with food safety and food labeling concerns.
627	Currently a global treaty, the BioSafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs.
627	The EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, whereas the US does not require transparent labeling of GMO foods.
627	Since there are still questions regarding the safety and risks associated with GMO foods, some believe the public should have the freedom to choose and know what they are eating and require all GMO products to be labeled.
627	Environmental impact  Agriculture imposes external costs upon society through pesticides, nutrient runoff, excessive water usage, and assorted other problems.
627	A 2000 assessment of agriculture in the UK determined total external costs for 1996 of £2,343 million, or £208 per hectare.
627	A 2005 analysis of these costs in the USA concluded that cropland imposes approximately $5 to 16 billion ($30 to $96 per hectare), while livestock production imposes $714 million.
627	Both studies concluded that more should be done to internalize external costs, and neither included subsidies in their analysis, but noted that subsidies also influence the cost of agriculture to society.
627	Both focused on purely fiscal impacts.
627	The 2000 review included reported pesticide poisonings but did not include speculative chronic effects of pesticides, and the 2004 review relied on a 1992 estimate of the total impact of pesticides.
627	In 2010, the International Resource Panel of the United Nations Environment Programme published a report assessing the environmental impacts of consumption and production.
627	The study found that agriculture and food consumption are two of the most important drivers of environmental pressures, particularly habitat change, climate change, water use and toxic emissions.
627	Agriculture accounts for 70 per cent of withdrawals of freshwater resources.
627	However, increasing pressure being placed on water resources by industry, cities and the involving biofuels industry means that water scarcity is increasing and agriculture is facing the challenge of producing more food for the world's growing population with fewer water resources.
627	Scientists are also realising that water resources need to be allocated to maintain natural environmental services, such as protecting towns from flooding, cleaning ecosystems and supporting fish stocks.
627	In the book Out of Water: From abundance to scarcity and how to solve the world's water problems, authors Colin Chartres and Samyukta Varma of the International Water Management Institute lay down a six-point plan of action for addressing the global challenge of producing sufficient food for the world with dwindling water resources.
627	One of the actions they say is required is to ensure all water systems, such as lakes and rivers, have water allocated to environmental flow.
627	Livestock issues  A senior UN official and co-author of a UN report detailing this problem, Henning Steinfeld, said "Livestock are one of the most significant contributors to today's most serious environmental problems".
627	Livestock production occupies 70% of all land used for agriculture, or 30% of the land surface of the planet.
627	It is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases, responsible for 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as measured in CO2 equivalents.
627	By comparison, all transportation emits 13.5% of the CO2.
627	It produces 65% of human-related nitrous oxide (which has 296 times the global warming potential of CO2,2.
627	It also generates 64% of the ammonia emission.
627	Livestock expansion is cited as a key factor driving deforestation, in the Amazon basin 70% of previously forested area is now occupied by pastures and the remainder used for feedcrops.
627	Through deforestation and land degradation, livestock is also driving reductions in biodiversity.
627	Land transformation and degradation  Land transformation, the use of land to yield goods and services, is the most substantial way humans alter the Earth's ecosystems, and is considered the driving force in the loss of biodiversity.
627	Estimates of the amount of land transformed by humans vary from 39–50%.
627	Land degradation, the long-term decline in ecosystem function and productivity, is estimated to be occurring on 24% of land worldwide, with cropland overrepresented.
627	The UN-FAO report cites land management as the driving factor behind degradation and reports that 1.5 billion people rely upon the degrading land.
627	Degradation can be deforestation, desertification, soil erosion, mineral depletion, or chemical degradation (acidification and salinization).
627	Eutrophication  Eutrophication, excessive nutrients in aquatic ecosystems resulting in algal blooms and anoxia, leads to fish kills, loss of biodiversity, and renders water unfit for drinking and other industrial uses.
627	Excessive fertilization and manure application to cropland, as well as high livestock stocking densities cause nutrient (mainly nitrogen and phosphorus) runoff and leaching from agricultural land.
627	These nutrients are major nonpoint pollutants contributing to eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems.
627	Pesticides  Pesticide use has increased since 1950 to 2.5 million tons annually worldwide, yet crop loss from pests has remained relatively constant.
627	The World Health Organization estimated in 1992 that 3 million pesticide poisonings occur annually, causing 220,000 deaths.
627	Pesticides select for pesticide resistance in the pest population, leading to a condition termed the 'pesticide treadmill' in which pest resistance warrants the development of a new pesticide.
627	An alternative argument is that the way to 'save the environment' and prevent famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming, a view exemplified by a quote heading the Center for Global Food Issues website: 'Growing more per acre leaves more land for nature'.
627	However, critics argue that a trade-off between the environment and a need for food is not inevitable, and that pesticides simply replace good agronomic practices such as crop rotation.
627	Climate change  Climate change has the potential to affect agriculture through changes in temperature, rainfall (timing and quantity), CO2, solar radiation and the interaction of these elements.
627	Extreme events, such as droughts and floods, are forecast to increase as climate change takes hold.
627	Agriculture is among sectors most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change; water supply for example, will be critical to sustain agricultural production and provide the increase in food output required to sustain the world's growing population.
627	Transformational approaches will be needed to manage natural resources in future.
627	For example, policies, practices and tools promoting climate-smart agriculture will be important, as will better use of scientific information on climate for assessing risks and vulnerability.
627	Planners and policy-makers will need to help create suitable policies that encourage funding for such agricultural transformation.
627	Agriculture can both mitigate or worsen global warming.
627	Some of the increase in CO2 in the atmosphere comes from the decomposition of organic matter in the soil, and much of the methane emitted into the atmosphere is caused by the decomposition of organic matter in wet soils such as rice paddies, as well as the normal digestive activities of farm animals.
627	Further, wet or anaerobic soils also lose nitrogen through denitrification, releasing the greenhouse gases nitric oxide and nitrous oxide.
627	Changes in management can reduce the release of these greenhouse gases, and soil can further be used to sequester some of the CO2 in the atmosphere.
627	Sustainability Some major organisations are hailing farming within agroecosystems as the way forward for mainstream agriculture.
627	Current farming methods have resulted in over-stretched water resources, high levels of erosion and reduced soil fertility.
627	According to a report by the International Water Management Institute and UNEP, there is not enough water to continue farming using current practices; therefore how we use critical water, land, and ecosystem resources to boost crop yields must be reconsidered.
627	The report suggested that we need to assign value to ecosystems, recognize environmental and livelihood tradeoffs, and balance the rights of a variety of users and interests.
627	We would also need to address inequities that result when such measures are adopted, such as the reallocation of water from poor to rich, the clearing of land to make way for more productive farmland, or the preservation of a wetland system that limits fishing rights.
627	Technological advancements help provide farmers with tools and resources to make farming more sustainable.
627	New technologies have given rise to innovations like conservation tillage, a farming process which helps prevent land loss to erosion, water pollution and enhances carbon sequestration.
627	International economics and market reports  Differences in economic development, population density and culture mean that the farmers of the world operate under very different conditions.
627	A US cotton farmer may receive US$230 in government subsidies per acre planted (in 2003), while farmers in Mali and other third-world countries do without.
627	When prices decline, the heavily subsidized US farmer is not forced to reduce his output, making it difficult for cotton prices to rebound, but his Mali counterpart may go broke in the meantime.
627	A livestock farmer in South Korea can calculate with a (highly subsidized) sales price of US$1300 for a calf produced.
627	A South American Mercosur country rancher calculates with a calf's sales price of US$120–200 (both 2008 figures).
627	With the former, scarcity and high cost of land is compensated with public subsidies, the latter compensates absence of subsidies with economics of scale and low cost of land.
627	In the Peoples Republic of China, a rural household's productive asset may be one hectare of farmland.
627	In Brazil, Paraguay and other countries where local legislature allows such purchases, international investors buy thousands of hectares of farmland or raw land at prices of a few hundred US$ per hectare.
627	To promote exports of agricultural products, many government agencies publish on the web economic studies and reports categorized by product and country.
627	Among these agencies include four of the largest exporters of agricultural products, such as the FAS of the United States Department of Agriculture, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC), Austrade, and NZTE .
627	The Federation of International Trade Associations publishes studies and reports by FAS and AAFC, as well as other non-governmental organizations on its website GlobalTrade.net.
627	List of countries by agricultural output  Below is a list of countries by agricultural output in 2011.
627	Energy and agriculture  Since the 1940s, agricultural productivity has increased dramatically, due largely to the increased use of energy-intensive mechanization, fertilizers and pesticides.
627	The vast majority of this energy input comes from fossil fuel sources.
627	Between 1950 and 1984, the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the globe, with world grain production increasing by 250% as world population doubled.
627	Modern agriculture's heavy reliance on petrochemicals and mechanization has raised concerns that oil shortages could increase costs and reduce agricultural output, causing food shortages.
627	Modern or industrialized agriculture is dependent on fossil fuels in two fundamental ways: 1) direct consumption on the farm and 2) indirect consumption to manufacture inputs used on the farm.
627	Direct consumption includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate farm vehicles and machinery; and use of gas, liquid propane, and electricity to power dryers, pumps, lights, heaters, and coolers.
627	American farms directly consumed about 1.2 exajoules (1.1 quadrillion BTU) in 2002, or just over 1 percent of the nation's total energy.
627	Indirect consumption is mainly oil and natural gas used to manufacture fertilizers and pesticides, which accounted for 0.6 exajoules (0.6 quadrillion BTU) in 2002.
627	The energy used to manufacture farm machinery is also a form of indirect agricultural energy consumption, but it is not included in USDA estimates of U.S.
627	Together, direct and indirect consumption by U.S.
627	Direct and indirect energy consumption by U.S.
627	"ncseonline.org"/> Food systems encompass not just agricultural production, but also off-farm processing, packaging, transporting, marketing, consumption, and disposal of food and food-related items.
627	Agriculture accounts for less than one-fifth of food system energy use in the United States.
627	In 2007, higher incentives for farmers to grow non-food biofuel crops combined with other factors (such as overdevelopment of former farm lands, rising transportation costs, climate change, growing consumer demand in China and India, and population growth) to cause food shortages in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Mexico, as well as rising food prices around the globe.
627	As of December 2007, 37 countries faced food crises, and 20 had imposed some sort of food-price controls.
627	Some of these shortages resulted in food riots and even deadly stampedes.
627	The biggest fossil fuel input to agriculture is the use of natural gas as a hydrogen source for the Haber-Bosch fertilizer-creation process.
627	Natural gas is used because it is the cheapest currently available source of hydrogen.
627	When oil production becomes so scarce that natural gas is used as a partial stopgap replacement, and hydrogen use in transportation increases, natural gas will become much more expensive.
627	If the Haber Process is unable to be commercialized using renewable energy (such as by electrolysis) or if other sources of hydrogen are not available to replace the Haber Process, in amounts sufficient to supply transportation and agricultural needs, this major source of fertilizer would either become extremely expensive or unavailable.
627	This would either cause food shortages or dramatic rises in food prices.
627	Mitigation of effects of petroleum shortages  In the event of a petroleum shortage (see peak oil for global concerns), organic agriculture can be more attractive than conventional practices that use petroleum-based pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers.
627	Some farmers using modern organic-farming methods have reported yields as high as those available from conventional farming.
627	Organic farming may however be more labor-intensive and would require a shift of the workforce from urban to rural areas.
627	The reconditioning of soil to restore nutrients lost during the use of monoculture agriculture techniques also takes time.
627	It has been suggested that rural communities might obtain fuel from the biochar and synfuel process, which uses agricultural waste to provide charcoal fertilizer, some fuel and food, instead of the normal food vs fuel debate.
627	As the synfuel would be used on-site, the process would be more efficient and might just provide enough fuel for a new organic-agriculture fusion.
627	It has been suggested that some transgenic plants may some day be developed which would allow for maintaining or increasing yields while requiring fewer fossil-fuel-derived inputs than conventional crops.
627	The possibility of success of these programs is questioned by ecologists and economists concerned with unsustainable GMO practices such as terminator seeds.
627	While there has been some research on sustainability using GMO crops, at least one prominent multi-year attempt by Mon some researchsanto Company has been unsuccessful, though during the same period traditional breeding techniques yielded a more sustainable variety of the same crop.
627	Electrical energy efficiency on farms  Policy  Agricultural policy focuses on the goals and methods of agricultural production.
627	At the policy level, common goals of agriculture include: * Conservation * Economic stability * Environmental sustainability * Food quality: Ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality.
627	Food safety: Ensuring that the food supply is free of contamination.
627	Food security: Ensuring that the food supply meets the population's needs.

628	Aldous Leonard Huxley (26 July 1894 – 22 November 1963) was an English writer and one of the most prominent members of the famous Huxley family.
628	Best known for his novels including Brave New World and a wide-ranging output of essays, Huxley also edited the magazine Oxford Poetry, and published short stories, poetry, travel writing, film stories and scripts.
628	Huxley spent the later part of his life in the United States, living in Los Angeles from 1937 until his death.
628	Aldous Huxley was a humanist, pacifist, and satirist, and he was latterly interested in spiritual subjects such as parapsychology and philosophical mysticism.
628	He is also well known for advocating and taking psychedelics.
628	By the end of his life Huxley was widely acknowledged as one of the pre-eminent intellectuals of his time.
628	Early life  Aldous Huxley was born in Godalming, Surrey, England, in 1894.
628	He was the third son of the writer and schoolmaster Leonard Huxley and his first wife, Julia Arnold, who founded Prior's Field School.
628	Julia was the niece of poet and critic Matthew Arnold and the sister of Mrs.
628	Humphrey Ward.
628	Aldous was the grandson of Thomas Henry Huxley, the zoologist, agnostic and controversialist ("Darwin's Bulldog").
628	His brother Julian Huxley and half-brother Andrew Huxley also became outstanding biologists.
628	Aldous had another brother, Noel Trevelyan Huxley (1891–1914), who committed suicide after a period of clinical depression.
628	Huxley began his learning in his father's well-equipped botanical laboratory, then continued in a school named Hillside.
628	His teacher was his mother, who supervised him for several years until she became terminally ill.
628	After Hillside, he was educated at Eton College.
628	Huxley's mother died in 1908 when he was 14.
628	In 1911, he suffered an illness (keratitis punctata) which "left [him] practically blind for two to three years".
628	Aldous' near-blindness disqualified him from service in the First World War.
628	Once his eyesight recovered sufficiently, he was able to study English literature at Balliol College, Oxford.
628	In 1916 he edited Oxford Poetry and later graduated (B.A.) with first class honours.
628	His brother Julian wrote, I believe his blindness was a blessing in disguise.
628	For one thing, it put paid to his idea of taking up medicine as a career ...
628	His uniqueness lay in his universalism.
628	He was able to take all knowledge for his province.
628	Following his education at Balliol, Huxley was financially indebted to his father and had to earn a living.
628	He taught French for a year at Eton, where Eric Blair (later to become George Orwell) and Stephen Runciman were among his pupils, but was remembered as an incompetent and hopeless teacher who couldn’t keep discipline.
628	Nevertheless, Blair and others were impressed by his use of words.
628	For a short while in 1918, he was employed acquiring provisions at the Air Ministry.
628	Significantly, Huxley also worked for a time in the 1920s at the technologically advanced Brunner and Mond chemical plant in Billingham, Teesside, and the most recent introduction to his famous science fiction novel Brave New World (1932) states that this experience of "an ordered universe in a world of planless incoherence" was one source for the novel.
628	Career Huxley completed his first (unpublished) novel at the age of 17 and began writing seriously in his early 20s.
628	His first published novels were social satires, beginning with Crome Yellow (1921).
628	Bloomsbury set  During the First World War, Huxley spent much of his time at Garsington Manor, home of Lady Ottoline Morrell, working as a farm labourer.
628	Here he met several Bloomsbury figures including Bertrand Russell and Clive Bell.
628	Later, in Crome Yellow (1921) he caricatured the Garsington lifestyle.
628	In 1919 he married Maria Nys, a Belgian woman he met at Garsington; they had one son.
628	The family lived in Italy part of the time in the 1920s, where Huxley would visit his friend D.
628	H.
628	Lawrence.
628	Following Lawrence's death in 1930, Huxley edited Lawrence's letters (1933).
628	Works of this period included important novels on the dehumanising aspects of scientific progress, most famously Brave New World, and on pacifist themes (for example, Eyeless in Gaza).
628	In Brave New World Huxley portrays a society operating on the principles of mass production and Pavlovian conditioning.
628	Huxley was strongly influenced by F.
628	Matthias Alexander and included him as a character in Eyeless in Gaza.
628	Starting from this period, Huxley began to write and edit non-fiction works on pacifist issues, including Ends and Means, An Encyclopedia of Pacifism, and Pacifism and Philosophy, and was an active member of the Peace Pledge Union.
628	The U.S.
628	In 1937, Huxley moved to Hollywood, with his wife Maria, son Matthew, and friend Gerald Heard.
628	He lived in the U.S., mainly in southern California, until his death, but also for a time in Taos, New Mexico, where he wrote Ends and Means (published in 1937).
628	In this work he examines the fact that although most people in modern civilisation agree that they want a world of "liberty, peace, justice, and brotherly love", they have not been able to agree on how to achieve it.
628	Heard introduced Huxley to Vedanta (Upanishad-centered philosophy), meditation, and vegetarianism through the principle of ahimsa.
628	In 1938 Huxley befriended J.
628	Krishnamurti, whose teachings he greatly admired.
628	He also became a Vedantist in the circle of Hindu Swami Prabhavananda, and introduced Christopher Isherwood to this circle.
628	Not long after, Huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas, The Perennial Philosophy, which discussed the teachings of renowned mystics of the world.
628	Huxley's book affirmed a sensibility that insists there are realities beyond the generally accepted "five senses" and that there is genuine meaning for humans beyond both sensual satisfactions and sentimentalities.
628	Huxley became a close friend of Remsen Bird, president of Occidental College.
628	He spent much time at the college, which is in the Eagle Rock neighbourhood of Los Angeles.
628	The college appears as "Tarzana College" in his satirical novel After Many a Summer (1939).
628	The novel won Huxley that year's James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction.
628	Huxley also incorporated Bird into the novel.
628	During this period Huxley earned some Hollywood income as a writer.
628	In March 1938, his friend Anita Loos, a novelist and screenwriter, put him in touch with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer who hired Huxley for Madame Curie which was originally to star Greta Garbo and be directed by George Cukor.
628	The film was eventually completed by MGM in 1943 with a different director and cast.) Huxley received screen credit for Pride and Prejudice (1940) and was paid for his work on a number of other films, including Jane Eyre (1944).
628	His experience in Hollywood was not a success.
628	When he wrote a synopsis of Alice in Wonderland, Walt Disney rejected it on the grounds that "he could only understand every third word".
628	Huxley's leisurely development of ideas, it seemed, was not suitable for the movie moguls, who demanded fast, dynamic dialogue above all else.
628	For Dick Huemer, during the 1940s, Huxley went to the first of a five meetings' session to elaborate the script of Alice in Wonderland but never came again.
628	For author John Grant, although the movie's character the Caterpillar displays some characteristics familiar from Huxley's discussion of his experiments with hallucinogens, Huxley's contribution to the movie is nonexistent.
628	On 21 October 1949, Huxley wrote to George Orwell, author of Nineteen Eighty-Four, congratulating him on "how fine and how profoundly important the book is".
628	In his letter to Orwell, he predicted: Within the next generation I believe that the world's leaders will discover that infant conditioning and narco-hypnosis are more efficient, as instruments of government, than clubs and prisons, and that the lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging them and kicking them into obedience.
628	Huxley had deeply felt apprehensions about the future the developed world might make for itself.
628	From these he put forward some warnings in his writings and talks.
628	In a 1958 televised interview conducted by journalist Mike Wallace, Huxley outlined several major concerns: the difficulties and dangers of world overpopulation; the tendency toward distieral major concerns: the difficulties and dangers nctly hierarchical social organization; the crucial importance of evaluating the use of technology in mass societies susceptible to wily persuasion; the tendency to promote modern politicians, to a naive public, as well-marketed commodities.
628	Post World War II  After the Second World War, Huxley applied for United States citizenship.
628	His application was continuously deferred on the grounds that he would not say he would take up arms to defend the U.S.
628	He claimed a philosophical, rather than a religious objection, and therefore was not exempt under the McCarran Act.
628	He withdrew his application.
628	Nevertheless, he remained in the country; and in 1959 he turned down an offer of a Knight Bachelor by the Macmillan government.
628	During the 1950s, Huxley's interest in the field of psychical research grew keener, and his later works are strongly influenced by both mysticism and his experiences with psychedelic drugs.
628	In October 1930, the English occultist Aleister Crowley dined with Huxley in Berlin, and to this day rumours persist that Crowley introduced Huxley to peyote on that occasion.
628	He was introduced to mescaline (the key active ingredient of peyote) by the psychiatrist Humphry Osmond in 1953, taking for his first time during the evening of May 5.
628	Through Dr.
628	Osmond, Huxley met millionaire Alfred Matthew Hubbard who would deal with LSD on a wholesale basis.
628	On 24 December 1955, Huxley took his first dose of LSD.
628	Indeed, Huxley was a pioneer of self-directed psychedelic drug use "in a search for enlightenment", famously taking 100 micrograms of LSD as he lay dying.
628	His psychedelic drug experiences are described in the essays The Doors of Perception (the title deriving from some lines in the book The Marriage of Heaven and Hell by William Blake), and Heaven and Hell.
628	Some of his writings on psychedelics became frequent reading among early hippies.
628	While living in Los Angeles, Huxley was a friend of Ray Bradbury.
628	According to Sam Weller's biography of Bradbury, the latter was dissatisfied with Huxley, especially after Huxley encouraged Bradbury to take psychedelic drugs.
628	Association with Vedanta  Beginning in 1939 and continuing until his death in 1963, Huxley had an extensive association with the Vedanta Society of Southern California, founded and headed by Swami Prabhavananda.
628	Together with Gerald Heard, Christopher Isherwood, and other followers he was initiated by the Swami and was taught meditation and spiritual practices.
628	In 1944 Huxley wrote the introduction to the "Bhagavad Gita: The Song of God", translated by Swami Prabhavanada and Christopher Isherwood, which was published by The Vedanta Society of Southern California.
628	From 1941 through 1960 Huxley contributed 48 articles to Vedanta and the West, published by the Society.
628	He also served on the editorial board with Isherwood, Heard, and playwright John van Druten from 1951 through 1962.
628	Huxley also occasionally lectured at the Hollywood and Santa Barbara Vedanta temples.
628	Two of those lectures have been released on CD: Knowledge and Understanding and Who Are We from 1955.
628	After the publication of The Doors of Perception, Huxley and the Swami disagreed about the meaning and importance of the LSD drug experience, which may have caused the relationship to cool, but Huxley continued to write articles for the Society's journal, lecture at the temple, and attend social functions.
628	Eyesight  With respect to details about the true quality of Huxley's eyesight at specific points in his life, there are differing accounts.
628	Around 1939, Huxley encountered the Bates Method for better eyesight, and a teacher, Margaret Corbett, who was able to teach him in the method.
628	In 1940, Huxley relocated from Hollywood to a 40 acre ranchito in the high desert hamlet of Llano, California, in northernmost Los Angeles County.
628	Huxley then said that his sight improved dramatically with the Bates Method and the extreme and pure natural lighting of the southwestern American desert.
628	He reported that for the first time in over 25 years, he was able to read without glasses and without strain.
628	He even tried driving a car along the dirt road beside the ranch.
628	He wrote a book about his successes with the Bates Method, The Art of Seeing, which was published in 1942 (US), 1943 (UK).
628	It was from this period, with the publication of the generally disputed theories contained in the latter book, that a growing degree of popular controversy arose over the subject of Huxley’s eyesight.
628	It was, and to a noticeable extent still is, widely held that, for most of his life, since the illness in his teens which left Huxley nearly blind, that his eyesight was exceedingly poor (despite the partial recovery which had enabled him to study at Oxford).
628	For instance, some ten years after publication of The Art of Seeing, in 1952, Bennett Cerf was present when Huxley spoke at a Hollywood banquet, wearing no glasses and apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty: "Then suddenly he faltered—and the disturbing truth became obvious.
628	He wasn't reading his address at all.
628	He had learned it by heart.
628	To refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes.
628	When it was only an inch or so away he still couldn't read it, and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him.
628	It was an agonising moment."
628	On the other hand, Huxley's second wife, Laura Archera Huxley, would later emphasise in her biographical account, This Timeless Moment: "One of the great achievements of his life: that of having regained his sight."
628	After revealing a letter she wrote to the Los Angeles Times disclaiming the label of Huxley as a "poor fellow who can hardly see" by Walter C.
628	Alvarez, she tempers this: "Although I feel it was an injustice to treat Aldous as though he were blind,she tempers this:  it is true there were many indications of his impaired vision.
628	For instance, although Aldous did not wear glasses, he would quite often use a magnifying lens."
628	Laura Huxley proceeds to elaborate a few nuances of inconsistency peculiar to Huxley's vision.
628	Her account, in this respect, is discernibly congruent with the following sample of Huxley's own words from The Art of Seeing.
628	"The most characteristic fact about the functioning of the total organism, or any part of the organism, is that it is not constant, but highly variable."
628	Nevertheless, the topic of Huxley’s eyesight continues to endure similar, significant controversy, regardless of how trivial a subject matter it might initially appear.
628	Personal life He married Maria Nys (10 September 1899 – 12 February 1955), a Belgian he met at Garsington, in 1919.
628	They had one child, Matthew Huxley (19 April 1920 – 10 February 2005), who had a career as an author, anthropologist, and prominent epidemiologist.
628	In 1955, Maria died of breast cancer.
628	In 1956 he married Laura Archera (1911–2007), also an author.
628	She wrote This Timeless Moment, a biography of Huxley.
628	In 1960 Huxley himself was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer, and in the years that followed, with his health deteriorating, he wrote the Utopian novel Island, and gave lectures on "Human Potentialities" at the Esalen Institute, which were fundamental to the forming of the Human Potential Movement.
628	Despite his interest in spirituality and mysticism, Huxley called himself an agnostic.
628	The most substantial collection of Huxley's few remaining papers (following the destruction of most in a fire) is at the Library of the University of California, Los Angeles.
628	Some are also at the Stanford University Library.
628	Death  On his deathbed, unable to speak, Huxley made a written request to his wife Laura for "LSD, 100 µg, intramuscular".
628	According to her account of his death in This Timeless Moment, she obliged with an injection at 11:45 am and a second one a few hours later; Huxley died aged 69, at 5:20 pm on 22 November 1963.
628	Media coverage of Huxley's passing was overshadowed by the assassination of President John F.
628	Kennedy, on the same day, as was the death of the British author C.
628	S.
628	Lewis, who also died on 22 November.
628	This coincidence was the inspiration for Peter Kreeft's book Between Heaven and Hell: A Dialog Somewhere Beyond Death with John F.
628	Kennedy, C.
628	S.
628	Lewis, & Aldous Huxley.
628	Huxley's ashes were interred in the family grave at the Watts Cemetery, home of the Watts Mortuary Chapel in Compton, a village near Guildford, Surrey, England.
628	Huxley's literary legacy continues to be represented by the literary agency headed by Georges Borchardt.

633	Algae ( or; singular alga, Latin for "seaweed") are a very large and diverse group of simple, typically autotrophic organisms, ranging from unicellular to multicellular forms, such as the giant kelps that grow to 65 meters in length.
633	Most are photosynthetic like plants, and "simple" because they lack the many distinct cell and organ types found in land plants.
633	The largest and most complex marine forms are called seaweeds.
633	Though the prokaryotic cyanobacteria are informally referred to as blue-green algae, this usage is incorrect  since they are regarded as bacteria.
633	The term algae is now restricted to eukaryotic organisms.
633	All true algae therefore have a nucleus enclosed within a membrane and plastids bound in one or more membranes.
633	Algae constitute a paraphyletic and polyphyletic group, as they do not include all the descendants of the last universal ancestor nor do they all descend from a common algal ancestor, although their plastids seem to have a single origin.
633	Diatoms are also examples of algae.
633	Algae exhibit a wide range of reproductive strategies, from simple, asexual cell division to complex forms of sexual reproduction.
633	Algae lack the various structures that characterize land plants, such as the leaf-like phyllids of bryophytes, rhizoids in nonvascular plants and the roots, leaves and other organs that are found in tracheophytes (vascular plants).
633	Many are phototrophic, although some groups contain members that are mixotrophic, deriving energy both from photosynthesis and uptake of organic carbon either by osmotrophy, myzotrophy, or phagotrophy.
633	Some unicellular species rely entirely on external energy sources and have limited or no photosynthetic apparatus.
633	Nearly all algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from cyanobacteria, and so produce oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis, unlike other photosynthetic bacteria such as purple and green sulfur bacteria.
633	Fossilized filamentous algae from the Vindhya basin have been dated back to 1.6 to 1.7 billion years ago.
633	Etymology and study  The singular alga is the Latin word for a particular seaweed and retains that meaning in English.
633	The etymology is obscure.
633	Although some speculate that it is related to Latin algēre, "be cold", there is no known reason to associate seaweed with temperature.
633	A more likely source is alliga, "binding, entwining."
633	The Ancient Greek word for seaweed was φῦκος (fūkos or phykos), which could mean either the seaweed (probably red algae) or a red dye derived from it.
633	The Latinization, fūcus, meant primarily the cosmetic rouge.
633	The etymology is uncertain, but a strong candidate has long been some word related to the Biblical פוך (pūk), "paint" (if not that word itself), a cosmetic eye-shadow used by the ancient Egyptians and other inhabitants of the eastern Mediterranean.
633	It could be any color: black, red, green, blue.
633	Accordingly the modern study of marine and freshwater algae is called either phycology or algology, depending on whether the Greek or Latin root is used.
633	The name Fucus appears in a number of taxa.
633	Classification While cyanobacteria have been traditionally considered algae, recent works usually exclude them due to large differences such as the lack of membrane-bound organelles, the presence of a single circular chromosome, the presence of peptidoglycan in the cell walls, and ribosomes different in size and content from those of the Eukaryotes.
633	Rather than in chloroplasts, they conduct photosynthesis on specialized infolded cytoplasmic membranes called thylakoid membranes.
633	Therefore, they differ significantly from algae despite occupying similar ecological niches.
633	By modern definitions, algae are Eukaryotes and conduct photosynthesis within membrane-bound organelles called chloroplasts.
633	Chloroplasts contain circular DNA and are similar in structure to cyanobacteria, presumably representing reduced cyanobacterial endosymbionts.
633	The exact nature of the chloroplasts is different among separate lineages of algae, reflecting different endosymbiotic events.
633	The table below describes the composition of the three major groups of algae.
633	Their lineage relationships are shown in the figure in the upper right.
633	Many of these groups contain some members that are no longer photosynthetic.
633	Some retain plastids, but not chloroplasts, while others have lost plastids entirely.
633	Phylogeny based on plastid not nucleocytoplasmic genealogy: W.H.Harvey (1811—1866) was the first to divide algae into four divisions based on their pigmentation.
633	This is the first use of a biochemical criterion in plant systematics.
633	Harvey's four divisions are: red algae (Rhodophyta), brown algae (Heteromontophyta), green algae (Chlorophyta) and Diatomaceae.
633	Relationship to higher plants The first plants on earth probably evolved from shallow freshwater algae much like Chara some 400 million years ago.
633	These probably had an isomorphic alternation of generations and were probably filamentous.
633	Fossils of isolated land plant spores suggest land plants may have been around as long as 475 million years ago.
633	Morphology A range of algal morphologies are exhibited, and convergence of features in unrelated groups is common.
633	The only groups to exhibit three dimensional multicellular thalli are the reds and browns, and some chlorophytes.
633	Apical growth is constrained to subsets of these groups: the florideophyte reds, various browns, and the charophytes.
633	The form of charophytes is quite different to those of reds and browns, because have distinct nodes, separated by internode 'stems'; whorls of branches reminiscent of the horsetails occur at the nodes.
633	Conceptacles are another polyphyletic trait; they appear in the coralline algae and the Hildenbrandiales, as well as the browns.
633	Most of the simpler algae are unicellular flagellates or amoeboids, but colonial and non-motile forms have developed independently among several of the groups.
633	Some of the more common organizational levels, more than one of which may occur in the life cycle of a species, are * Colonial: small, regular groups of motile cells * Capsoid: individual non-motile cells embedded in mucilage * Coccoid: individual non-motile cells with cell walls * Palmelloid: non-motile cells embedded in mucilage * Filamentous: a string of non-motile cells connected together, sometimes branching * Parenchymatous: cells forming a thallus with partial differentiation of tissues In three lines even higher levels of organization have been reached, with full tissue differentiation.
633	These are the brown algae,—some of which may reach 50 m in length (kelps)—the red algae, and the green algae.
633	The most complex forms are found among the green algae (see Charales and Charophyta), in a lineage that eventually led to nd among the green algaethe higher land plants.
633	The point where these non-algal plants begin and algae stop is usually taken to be the presence of reproductive organs with protective cell layers, a characteristic not found in the other alga groups.
633	Physiology Many algae, particularly members of the characeae, have served as model experimental organisms to understand the mechanisms of the water permeability of membranes, osmoregulation, turgor regulation, salt tolerance, cytoplasmic streaming, and the generation of action potentials.
633	Symbiotic algae Some species of algae form symbiotic relationships with other organisms.
633	In these symbioses, the algae supply photosynthates (organic substances) to the host organism providing protection to the algal cells.
633	The host organism derives some or all of its energy requirements from the algae.
633	Examples are as follows.
633	Lichens Lichens are defined by the International Association for Lichenology to be "an association of a fungus and a photosynthetic symbiont resulting in a stable vegetative body having a specific structure."
633	The fungi, or mycobionts, are from the Ascomycota with a few from the Basidiomycota.
633	They are not found alone in nature but when they began to associate is not known.
633	One mycobiont associates with the same phycobiont species, rarely two, from the green algae, except that alternatively the mycobiont may associate with the same species of cyanobacteria (hence "photobiont" is the more accurate term).
633	A photobiont may be associated with many specific mycobionts or live independently; accordingly, lichens are named and classified as fungal species.
633	The association is termed a morphogenesis because the lichen has a form and capabilities not possessed by the symbiont species alone (they can be experimentally isolated).
633	It is possible that the photobiont triggers otherwise latent genes in the mycobiont.
633	Coral reefs  Coral reefs are accumulated from the calcareous exoskeletons of marine invertebrates of the order Scleractinia (stony corals).
633	As animals they metabolize sugar and oxygen to obtain energy for their cell-building processes, including secretion of the exoskeleton, with water and carbon dioxide as byproducts.
633	As the reef is the result of a favorable equilibrium between construction by the corals and destruction by marine erosion, the rate at which metabolism can proceed determines the growth or deterioration of the reef.
633	Dinoflagellates (algal protists) are often endosymbionts in the cells of marine invertebrates, where they accelerate host-cell metabolism by generating immediately available sugar and oxygen through photosynthesis using incident light and the carbon dioxide produced by the host.
633	Stony corals that are reef-building corals (hermatypic corals) require endosymbiotic algae from the genus Symbiodinium to be in a healthy condition.
633	The loss of Symbiodinium from the host is known as coral bleaching, a condition which leads to the deterioration of a reef.
633	Sea sponges Green algae live close to the surface of some sponges, for example, breadcrumb sponge (Halichondria panicea).
633	The alga is thus protected from predators; the sponge is provided with oxygen and sugars which can account for 50 to 80% of sponge growth in some species.
633	Life-cycle Rhodophyta, Chlorophyta and Heterokontophyta, the three main algal Phyla, have life-cycles which show tremendous variation with considerable complexity.
633	In general there is an asexual phase where the seaweed's cells are diploid, a sexual phase where the cells are haploid followed by fusion of the male and female gametes.
633	Asexual reproduction is advantageous in that it permits efficient population increases, but less variation is possible.
633	Sexual reproduction allows more variation, but is more costly.
633	Often there is no strict alternation between the sporophyte and also because there is often an asexual phase, which could include the fragmentation of the thallus.
633	Numbers The Algal Collection of the US National Herbarium (located in the National Museum of Natural History) consists of approximately 320,500 dried specimens, which, although not exhaustive (no exhaustive collection exists), gives an idea of the order of magnitude of the number of algal species (that number remains unknown).
633	Estimates vary widely.
633	For example, according to one standard textbook, in the British Isles the UK Biodiversity Steering Group Report estimated there to be 20000 algal species in the UK.
633	Another checklist reports only about 5000 species.
633	Regarding the difference of about 15000 species, the text concludes: "It will require many detailed field surveys before it is possible to provide a reliable estimate of the total number of species ..."
633	Regional and group estimates have been made as well:  *5000–5500 species of red algae worldwide *"some 1300 in Australian Seas" *400 seaweed species for the western coastline of South Africa, and 212 species from the coast of KwaZulu-Natal.
633	Some of these are duplicates as the range extends across both coasts, and the total recorded is probably about 500 species.
633	Most of these are listed in List of seaweeds of South Africa.
633	These exclude phytoplankton and crustose corallines.
633	California (US) *642 in the check-list of Britain and Ireland and so on, but lacking any scientific basis or reliable sources, these numbers have no more credibility than the British ones mentioned above.
633	Most estimates also omit microscopic algae, such as phytoplankton.
633	The most recent estimate suggests a total number of 72,500 algal species worldwide.
633	Distribution The topic of distribution of algal species has been fairly well studied since the founding of phytogeography in the mid-19th century AD.
633	Algae spread mainly by the dispersal of spores analogously to the dispersal of Plantae by seeds and spores.
633	Spores are everywhere in all parts of the Earth: the waters fresh and marine, the atmosphere, free-floating and in precipitation or mixed with dust, the humus and in other organisms, such as humans.
633	Whether a spore is to grow into an organism depends on the combination of the species and the environmental conditions of where the spore lands.
633	The spores of fresh-water algae are dispersed mainly by running water and wind, as well as by living carriers.
633	The bodies of water into which they are transported are chemically selective.
633	Marine spores are spread by currents.
633	Ocean water is temperature selective, resulting in phytogeographic zones, regions and provinces.
633	To some degree the distribution of algae is subject to floristic discontinuities caused by geographical features, such as Antarctica, long distances of ocean or general land masses.
633	It is therefore possible to identify species occurring by locality, such as "Pacific Algae" or "North Sea Algae".
633	When they occur out of their localities, it is usually possible to hypothesize a transport mechanism, such as the hulls of ships.
633	For example, Ulva reticulata and Ulva fasciata travelled from the mainland to Hawaii in this manner.
633	Mapping is possible for select species only: "there are many valid examples of confined distribution patterns."
633	For example, Clathromorphum is an arctic genus and is not mapped far south of there.
633	On the other hand, scientists regard the overall data as insufficient due to the "difficulties of undertaking such studies."
633	Locations Algae are prominent in bodies of water, common in terrestrial environments and are found in unusual environments, such as on snow and on ice.
633	Seaweeds grow mostly in shallow marine waters, under 100 m; however some have been recorded to a depth of 360 m.
633	The various sorts of algae play significant roles in aquatic ecology.
633	Microscopic forms that live suspended in the water column (phytoplankton) provide the food base for most marine food chains.
633	In very high densities (algal blooms) these algae may discolor the water and outcompete, poison, or asphyxiate other life forms.
633	Algae are variously sensitive to different factors, which has made them useful as biological indicators in the Ballantine Scale and its modification.
633	Uses Agar Agar, a gelatinous substance derived from red algae, has a number of commercial uses.
633	It is a good medium for bacteria.
633	Alginates Between 100,000 and 170,000 wet tons of Macrocystis are harvested annually in California for alginate extraction and abalone feed.
633	Energy source To be competitive and independent from fluctuating support from (local) policy on the long run, biofuels should equal or beat the cost level of fossil fuels.
633	Here, algae based fuels hold great promise, directly related to the potential to produce more biomass per unit area in a year than any other form of biomass.
633	The break-even point for algae-based biofuels is estimated to occur in about ten to fifteen years.
633	Fertilizer For centuries seaweed has been used as a fertilizer; George Owen of Henllys writing in the 16th century referring to drift weed in South Wales:This kind of ore they often gather and lay on great heapes, where it heteth and rotteth, and will have a strong and loathsome smell; when being so rotten they cast on the land, as they do their muck, and thereof springeth good corn, especially barley ...
633	After spring-tydes or great rigs of the sea, they fetch it in sacks on horse backes, and carie the same three, four, or five miles, and cast it on the lande, which doth very much better the ground for corn and grass.
633	Today, algae are used by humans in many ways; for example, as fertilizers, soil conditioners and livestock feed.
633	Aquatic and microscopic species are cultured in clear tanks or ponds and are either harvested or used to treat effluents pumped through the ponds.
633	Algaculture on a large scale is an important type of aquaculture in some places.
633	Maerl is commonly used as a soil conditioner.
633	Nutrition Naturally growing seaweeds are an important source of food, especially in Asia.
633	They provide many vitamins including: A, B1, B2, B6, niacin and C, and are rich in iodine, potassium, iron, magnesium and calcium.
633	In addition commercially cultivated microalgae, including both algae and cyanobacteria, are marketed as nutritional supplements, such as Spirulina, Chlorella and the Vitamin-C supplement, Dunaliella, high in beta-carotene.
633	Algae are national foods of many nations: China consumes more than 70 species, including fat choy, a cyanobacterium considered a vegetable; Japan, over 20 species; Ireland, dulse; Chile, cochayuyo.
633	Laver is used to make "laver bread" in Wales where it is known as bara lawr; in Korea, gim; in Japan, nori and aonori.
633	It is also used along the west coast of North America from California to British Columbia, in Hawaii and by the Māori of New Zealand.
633	Sea lettuce and badderlocks are a salad ingredient in Scotland, Ireland, Greenland and Iceland.
633	The oils from some algae have high levels of unsaturated fatty acids.
633	For example, Parietochloris incisa is very high in arachidonic acid, where it reaches up to 47% of the triglyceride pool.
633	Some varieties of algae favored by vegetarianism and veganism contain the long-chain, essential omega-3 fatty acids, Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA).
633	Fish oil contains the omega-3 fatty acids, but the original source is algae (microalgae in particular), which are eaten by marine life such as copepods and are passed up the food chain.
633	Algae has emerged in recent years as a popular source of omega-3 fatty acids for vegetarians who cannot get long-chain EPA and DHA from other vegetarian sources such as flaxseed oil, which only contains the short-chain Alpha-Linolenic acid (ALA).
633	Pollution control * Sewage can be treated with algae, reducing the need for greater amounts of toxic chemicals than are already used.
633	Algae can be used to capture fertilizers in runoff from farms.
633	When subsequently harvested, the enriched algae itself can be used as fertilizer.
633	Aquariums and ponds can be filtered using algae, which absorb nutrients from the water in a device called an algae scrubber, also known as an "ATS".
633	Agricultural Research Service scientists found that 60-90% of nitrogen runoff and 70-100% of phosphorus runoff can be captured from manure effluents using an algal turf scrubber (ATS).
633	Scientists developed the ATS, which are shallow, 100-foot raceways of nylon netting where algae colonies can form, and studied its efficacy for three years.
633	They found that algae can readily be used to reduce the nutrient runoff from agricultural fields and increase the quality of water flowing into rivers, streams, and oceans.
633	The enriched algae itself also can be used as a fertilizer.
633	Researchers collected and dried the nutrient-rich algae from the ATS and studied its potential as an organic fertilizer.
633	They found that cucumber and corn seedlings grew just as well using ATS organic fertilizer as they did with commercial fertilizers.
633	Pigments The natural pigments produced by algae can be used as an alternative to chemical dyes and coloring agents.
633	Stabilizing substances Carrageenan, from the red alga Chondrus crispus, is used as a stabilizer in milk products.
634	In statistics, analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a collection of statistical models, and their associated procedures, in which the observed variance in a particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation.
634	In its simplest form, ANOVA provides a statistical test of whether or not the means of several groups are all equal, and therefore generalizes t-test to more than two groups.
634	Doing multiple two-sample t-tests would result in an increased chance of committing a type I error.
634	For this reason, ANOVAs are useful in comparing three, or more means.
634	Background and terminology ANOVA is a particular form of statistical hypothesis testing heavily used in the analysis of experimental data.
634	A statistical hypothesis test is a method of making decisions using data.
634	A test  result (calculated from the null hypothesis and the sample) is called statistically significant if it is deemed unlikely to have occurred by chance, assuming the truth of the null hypothesis.
634	A statistically significant result (when a probability (p-value) is less than a threshold (significance level)) justifies the rejection of the null hypothesis.
634	In the typical application of ANOVA, the null hypothesis is that all groups are simply random samples of the same population.
634	This implies that all treatments have the same effect (perhaps none).
634	Rejecting  the null hypothesis implies that different treatments result in altered effects.
634	By construction, hypothesis testing limits the rate  of Type I errors (false positives leading to false scientific claims)  to a significance level.
634	Experimenters also wish to limit Type II  errors (false negatives resulting in missed scientific discoveries).
634	The Type II error rate is a function of several things including  sample size (positively correlated with experiment cost), significance  level (when the standard of proof is high, the chances of overlooking  a discovery are also high) and effect size (when the effect is  obvious to the casual observer, Type II error rates are low).
634	The terminology of ANOVA is largely from the statistical  design of experiments.
634	The experimenter adjusts factors and  measures responses in an attempt to determine an effect.
634	Factors are  assigned to experimental units by a combination of randomization and  blocking to ensure the validity of the results.
634	Blinding keeps the weighing impartial.
634	Responses show a variability that is partially  the result of the effect and is partially random error.
634	ANOVA is the synthesis of several ideas and it is used for multiple  purposes.
634	As a consequence, it is difficult to define concisely or precisely.
634	"Classical ANOVA for balanced data does three things at once: # As exploratory data analysis, an ANOVA is an organization of an additive data decomposition, and its sums of squares indicate the variance of each component of the decomposition (or, equivalently, each set of terms of a linear model).
634	Comparisons of mean squares, along with F-tests ...
634	Closely related to the ANOVA is a linear model fit with coefficient estimates and standard errors."
634	In short, ANOVA is a statistical tool used in several ways to develop and confirm an explanation for the observed data.
634	Additionally: # It is computationally elegant and relatively robust against violations to its assumptions.
634	ANOVA provides industrial strength (multiple sample comparison) statistical analysis.
634	It has been adapted to the analysis of a variety of experimental designs.
634	As a result: ANOVA "has long enjoyed the status of being the most used (some would  say abused) statistical technique in psychological research."
634	ANOVA "is probably the most useful technique in the field of  statistical inference."
634	ANOVA is difficult to teach, particularly for complex experiments, with split-plot designs being notorious.
634	In some cases the proper  application of the method is best determined by problem pattern recognition  followed by the consultation of a classic authoritative test.
634	Design-of-experiments terms (Condensed from the NIST Engineering Statistics handbook: Section 5.7.
634	A  Glossary of DOE Terminology.) ; Balanced design: An experimental design where all cells (i.e.
634	Blocking: A schedule for conducting treatment combinations in an experimental study such that any effects on the experimental results due to a known change in raw materials, operators, machines, etc., become concentrated in the levels of the blocking variable.
634	The reason for blocking is to isolate a systematic effect and prevent it from obscuring the main effects.
634	Blockinr blocking ig is achieved by restricting randomization.
634	Design: A set of experimental runs which allows the fit of a particular model and the estimate of effects.
634	DOE: Design of experiments.
634	An approach to problem solving involving collection of data that will support valid, defensible, and supportable conclusions.
634	Effect: How changing the settings of a factor changes the response.
634	The effect of a single factor is also called a main effect.
634	Error: Unexplained variation in a collection of observations.
634	DOE's typically require understanding of both random error and lack of fit error.
634	Experimental unit: The entity to which a specific treatment combination is applied.
634	Factors: Process inputs an investigator manipulates to cause a change in the output.
634	Lack-of-fit error: Error that occurs when the analysis omits one or more important terms or factors from the process model.
634	Including replication in a DOE allows separation of experimental error into its components: lack of fit and random (pure) error.
634	Model: Mathematical relationship which relates changes in a given response to changes in one or more factors.
634	Random error: Error that occurs due to natural variation in the process.
634	Random error is typically assumed to be normally distributed with zero mean and a constant variance.
634	Random error is also called experimental error.
634	Randomization: A schedule for allocating treatment material and for conducting treatment combinations in a DOE such that the conditions in one run neither depend on the conditions of the previous run nor predict the conditions in the subsequent runs.
634	Replication: Performing the same treatment combination more than once.
634	Including replication allows an estimate of the random error independent of any lack of fit error.
634	Responses: The output(s) of a process.
634	Sometimes called dependent variable(s).
634	Treatment: A treatment is a specific combination of factor levels whose effect is to be compared with other treatments.
634	Classes of models There are three classes of models used in the analysis of variance, and these are outlined here.
634	Fixed-effects models (Model 1) The fixed-effects model of analysis of variance applies to situations in which the experimenter applies one or more treatments to the subjects of the experiment to see if the response variable values change.
634	This allows the experimenter to estimate the ranges of response variable values that the treatment would generate in the population as a whole.
634	Random-effects models (Model 2) Random effects models are used when the treatments are not fixed.
634	This occurs when the various factor levels are sampled from a larger population.
634	Because the levels themselves are random variables, some assumptions and the method of contrasting the treatments (a multi-variable generalization of simple differences) differ from the fixed-effects model.
634	Mixed-effects models (Model 3) A mixed-effects model contains experimental factors of both fixed and random-effects types, with appropriately different interpretations and analysis for the two types.
634	Example: Teaching experiments could be performed by a university department  to find a good introductory textbook, with each text considered a  treatment.
634	The fixed-effects model would compare a list of candidate  texts.
634	The random-effects model would determine whether important  differences exist among a list of randomly selected texts.
634	The  mixed-effects model would compare the (fixed) incumbent texts to  randomly selected alternatives.
634	Defining fixed and random effects has proven elusive, with competing  definitions arguably leading toward a linguistic quagmire.
634	Assumptions of ANOVA The analysis of variance has been studied from several approaches, the most common of which uses a linear model that relates the response to the treatments and blocks.
634	Even when the statistical model is nonlinear, it can be approximated by a linear model for which an analysis of variance may be appropriate.
634	Textbook analysis using a normal distribution The analysis of variance can be presented in terms of a linear model, which makes the following assumptions about the probability distribution of the responses: * Independence of observations – this is an assumption of the model that simplifies the statistical analysis.
634	Normality – the distributions of the residuals are normal.
634	Equality (or "homogeneity") of variances, called homoscedasticity — the variance of data in groups should be the same.
634	The separate assumptions of the textbook model imply that the errors are independently, identically, and normally distributed for fixed effects models, that is, that the errors ('s) are independent and Randomization-based analysis In a randomized controlled experiment, the treatments are randomly assigned to experimental units, following the experimental protocol.
634	This randomization is objective and declared before the experiment is carried out.
634	The objective random-assignment is used to test the significance of the null hypothesis, following the ideas of C.
634	S.
634	Peirce and Ronald A.
634	Fisher.
634	This design-based analysis was discussed and developed by Francis J.
634	Anscombe at Rothamsted Experimental Station and by Oscar Kempthorne at Iowa State University.
634	Kempthorne and his students make an assumption of unit treatment additivity, which is discussed in the books of Kempthorne and David R.
634	Cox.
634	Unit-treatment additivity In its simplest form, the assumption of unit-treatment additivity states that the observed response  from experimental unit  when receiving treatment  can be written as the sum of >iCritical (Numerator DF, Denominator DF, α) then reject the null hypothesis.
634	The computer method calculates the probability (p-value) of a value of  F greater than or equal to the observed value.
634	The null hypothesis is  rejected if this probability is less than or equal to the significance  level (α).
634	The two methods produce the same result.
634	The ANOVA F-test is known to be nearly optimal in the sense of  minimizing false negative errors for a fixed rate of false positive  errors (maximizing power for a fixed significance level).
634	To test the hypothesis that all treatments have exactly the same effect, the F-test's p-values closely approximate the permutation test's p-values: The approximation is particularly close when the design is balanced.
634	Such permutation tests characterize tests with maximum power against all alternative hypotheses, as observed by Rosenbaum.
634	The ANOVA F–test (of the null-hypothesis that all treatments have exactly the same effect) is recommended as a practical test, because of its robustness against many alternative distributions.
634	Extended logic ANOVA consists of separable parts; partitioning sources of variance  and hypothesis testing can be used individually.
634	ANOVA is used to  support other statistical tools.
634	Regression is first used to fit more  complex models to data, then ANOVA is used to compare models with the  objective of selecting simple(r) models that adequately describe the  data.
634	"Such models could be fit without any reference to ANOVA, but  ANOVA tools could then be used to make some sense of the fitted models,  and to test hypotheses about batches of coefficients."
634	"[W]e think of the analysis of variance as a way of understanding and structuring  multilevel models—not as an alternative to regression but as a tool  for summarizing complex high-dimensional inferences ..."
634	ANOVA for a single factor The simplest experiment suitable for ANOVA analysis is the completely  randomized experiment with a single factor.
634	More complex experiments  with a single factor involve constraints on randomization and include  completely randomized blocks and Latin squares (and variants:  Graeco-Latin squares, etc.).
634	The more complex experiments share many  of the complexities of multiple factors.
634	A relatively complete  discussion of the analysis (models, data summaries, ANOVA table) of  the completely randomized experiment is  available.
634	ANOVA for multiple factors ANOVA generalizes to the study of the effects of multiple factors.
634	When the experiment includes observations at all combinations of  levels of each factor, it is termed factorial.
634	Factorial experiments  are more efficient than a series of single factor experiments and the  e].
634	Factorial exfficiency grows as the number of factors increases.
634	Consequently, factorial designs are heavily used.
634	The use of ANOVA to study the effects of multiple factors has a  complication.
634	In a 3-way ANOVA with factors x, y and z, the ANOVA  model includes terms for the main effects (x, y, z) and  terms for interactions (xy, xz, yz, xyz).
634	All terms require hypothesis tests.
634	The proliferation of interaction  terms increases the risk  that some hypothesis test will produce a false positive by chance.
634	Fortunately, experience says that high order interactions are rare.
634	The ability to detect interactions is a major advantage of multiple  factor ANOVA.
634	Testing one factor at a time hides interactions, but  produces apparently inconsistent experimental results.
634	Caution is advised when encountering interactions; Test   interaction terms first and expand the analysis beyond ANOVA if  interactions are found.
634	Texts vary in their recommendations regarding  the continuation of the ANOVA procedure after encountering an  interaction.
634	Interactions complicate the interpretation of  experimental data.
634	Neither the calculations of significance nor the  estimated treatment effects can be taken at face value.
634	"A  significant interaction will often mask the significance of main  effects."
634	Graphical methods are recommended to enhance understanding.
634	Regression is often useful.
634	A lengthy discussion of interactions is available in Cox (1958).
634	Some  interactions can be removed (by transformations) while others cannot.
634	A variety of techniques are used with multiple factor ANOVA to reduce  expense.
634	One technique used in factorial designs is to minimize  replication (possibly no replication with support of  analytical trickery) and to combine  groups when effects are found to be  statistically (or practically) insignificant.
634	An experiment with many  insignificant factors may collapse into one with a few factors  supported by many replications.
634	Worked numeric examples Several fully worked numerical examples are available.
634	A  simple case uses one-way (a single  factor) analysis.
634	A more complex case  uses two-way (two-factor) analysis.
634	Associated analysis Some analysis is required in support of the design of the  experiment while other analysis is performed after changes in the  factors are formally found to produce statistically significant  changes in the responses.
634	Because experimentation is iterative, the  results of one experiment alter plans for following experiments.
634	Preparatory analysis The number of experimental units In the design of an experiment, the number of experimental units is planned to satisfy the goals of the experiment.
634	Experimentation is often sequential.
634	Early experiments are often designed to provide mean-unbiased estimates of treatment effects and of experimental error.
634	Later experiments are often designed to test a hypothesis that a treatment effect has an important magnitude; in this case, the number of experimental units is chosen so that the experiment is within budget and has adequate power, among other goals.
634	Reporting sample size analysis is generally required in psychology.
634	"Provide information on sample size and the process that led to sample  size decisions."
634	The analysis, which is written in the experimental protocol before the experiment is conducted, is examined in grant applications and administrative review boards.
634	Besides the power analysis, there are less formal methods for selecting the number of experimental units.
634	These include graphical methods based on limiting the probability of false negative errors, graphical methods based on an expected variation increase (above the residuals) and methods based  on achieving a desired confident interval.
634	Power analysis Power analysis is often applied in the context of ANOVA in order to assess the probability of successfully rejecting the null hypothesis if we assume a certain ANOVA design, effect size in the population, sample size and significance level.
634	Power analysis can assist in study design by determining what sample size would be required in order to have a reasonable chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true.
634	Effect size Several standardized measures of effect gauge the strength of the association between a predictor (or set of predictors) and the dependent variable.
634	Effect-size estimates facilitate the comparison of findings in studies and across disciplines.
634	A non-standardized measure of effect size with meaningful units may  be preferred for reporting purposes.
634	Eta-squared describes the ratio of variance explained in the dependent variable by a predictor while controlling for other predictors.
634	Eta-squared is a biased estimator of the variance explained by the model in the population (it estimates only the effect size in the sample).
634	On average it overestimates the variance explained in the population.
634	As the sample size gets larger the amount of bias gets smaller, Cohen (1992) suggests effect sizes for various indexes, including ƒ (where 0.1 is a small effect, 0.25 is a medium effect and 0.4 is a large effect).
634	He also offers a conversion table (see Cohen, 1988, p. 283) for eta squared (η2) where 0.0099 constitutes a small effect, 0.0588 a medium effect and 0.1379 a large effect.
634	Followup analysis It is always appropriate to carefully consider outliers.
634	They have a  disproportionate impact on statistical conclusions and are often the result of errors.
634	Model confirmation It is prudent to verify that the assumptions of ANOVA have been met.
634	Residuals are examined or analyzed to confirm homoscedasticity  and gross normality.
634	Residuals should have the appearance of (zero mean normal distribution)  noise when plotted as a function of anything including time and  modeled data values.
634	Trends hint at interactions among factors or  among observations.
634	One rule of thumb: "If the largest standard deviation  is less than twice the smallest standard deviation, we can use methods  based on the assumption of equal standard deviations and our results  will still be approximately correct."
634	Follow-up tests A statistically significant effect in ANOVA is often followed up with one or more different follow-up tests.
634	This can be done in order to assess which groups are different from which other groups or to test various other focused hypotheses.
634	Follow-up tests are often distinguished in terms of whethero test variou they are planned (a priori) or post hoc.
634	Planned tests are determined before looking at the data and post hoc tests are performed after looking at the data.
634	Often one of the "treatments" is none, so the treatment group can act  as a control.
634	Dunnett's test (a modification of the t-test)  tests whether each of the other treatment groups has the same  mean as the control.
634	Post hoc tests such as Tukey's range test most commonly compare every group mean with every other group mean and typically incorporate some method of controlling for Type I errors.
634	Comparisons, which are most commonly planned, can be either simple or compound.
634	Simple comparisons compare one group mean with one other group mean.
634	Compound comparisons typically compare two sets of groups means where one set has two or more groups (e.g., compare average group means of group A, B and C with group D).
634	Comparisons can also look at tests of trend, such as linear and quadratic relationships, when the independent variable involves ordered levels.
634	Following ANOVA with pair-wise multiple-comparison tests has been  criticized on several grounds.
634	There are many such tests (10 in one table) and recommendations  regarding their use are vague or conflicting.
634	Study designs and ANOVAs There are several types of ANOVA.
634	Many statisticians base ANOVA on the design of the experiment, especially on the protocol that specifies the random assignment of treatments to subjects; the protocol's description of the assignment mechanism should include a specification of the structure of the treatments and of any blocking.
634	It is also common to apply ANOVA to observational data using an appropriate statistical model.
634	Some popular designs use the following types of ANOVA: *One-way ANOVA is used to test for differences among two or more independent groups (means),e.g.
634	Typically, however, the one-way ANOVA is used to test for differences among at least three groups, since the two-group case can be covered by a t-test.
634	When there are only two means to compare, the t-test and the ANOVA F-test are equivalent; the relation between ANOVA and t is given by F = t2.
634	Factorial ANOVA is used when the experimenter wants to study the interaction effects among the treatments.
634	Repeated measures ANOVA is used when the same subjects are used for each treatment (e.g., in a longitudinal study).
634	Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) is used when there is more than one response variable.
634	ANOVA cautions Balanced experiments (those with an equal sample size for each  treatment) are relatively easy to interpret; Unbalanced  experiments offer more complexity.
634	For single factor (one way) ANOVA,  the adjustment for unbalanced data is easy, but the unbalanced  analysis lacks both robustness and power.
634	For more complex designs the lack of balance leads to further complications.
634	"The orthogonality  property of main effects and interactions present in balanced data  does not carry over to the unbalanced case.
634	This  means that the usual analysis of variance techniques do not apply.
634	Consequently, the analysis of unbalanced factorials is much more  difficult than that for balanced designs."
634	In the  general case, "The analysis of variance can also be applied to  unbalanced data, but then the sums of squares, mean squares, and  F-ratios will depend on the order in which the sources of variation  are considered."
634	The simplest techniques for  handling unbalanced data restore balance by either throwing out data  or by synthesizing missing data.
634	More complex techniques use  regression.
634	ANOVA is (in part) a significance test.
634	The American Psychological Association holds the view that simply reporting significance is  insufficient and that reporting confidence bounds is preferred.
634	While ANOVA is conservative (in maintaining a significance level)  against multiple comparisons in one dimension, it is not conservative  against comparisons in multiple dimensions.
634	Generalizations ANOVA is considered to be a special case of linear regression  which in turn is a special case of the general linear model.
634	All consider the observations to be the sum of a model (fit) and a residual (error) to be minimized.
634	The Kruskal–Wallis test and the Friedman test are nonparametric tests, which  do not rely on an assumption of normality.
634	History While the analysis of variance reached fruition in the 20th century, antecedents extend centuries into the past according to Stigler.
634	These include hypothesis testing, the partitioning of sums of  squares, experimental techniques and the additive model.
634	Laplace was performing hypothesis testing in the 1770s.
634	The development of least-squares methods by Laplace and Gauss circa  1800 provided an improved method of combining observations (over the  existing practices of astronomy and geodesy).
634	It also initiated much  study of the contributions to sums of squares.
634	Laplace soon knew how  to estimate a variance from a residual (rather than a total) sum of  squares.
634	By 1827 Laplace was using least  squares methods to address ANOVA problems regarding measurements of  atmospheric tides.
634	Before 1800 astronomers had isolated observational errors resulting  from reaction times (the "personal equation") and had developed  methods of reducing the errors.
634	The  experimental methods used in the study of the personal equation were  later accepted by the emerging field of psychology  which developed strong  (full factorial) experimental methods to which randomization and  blinding were soon added.
634	An eloquent  non-mathematical explanation of the additive effects model was available in 1885.
634	Sir Ronald Fisher introduced the term "variance&quler (1986, pp&ot; and proposed a formal analysis of variance in a 1918 article The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance.
634	His first application of the analysis of variance was published in 1921.
634	Analysis of variance became widely known after being included in Fisher's 1925 book Statistical Methods for Research Workers.
634	Randomization models were developed by several.
634	The first was  published in Polish by Neyman in 1923.
634	One of the attributes of ANOVA which ensured its early popularity was  computational elegance.
634	The structure of the additive model allows  solution for the additive coefficients by simple algebra rather than  by matrix calculations.
634	In the era of mechanical calculators this  simplicity was critical.
634	The determination of statistical  significance also required access to tables of the F function which  were supplied by early statistics texts.
639	Alkanes , or paraffins (a still-used historical name for alkanes), are saturated hydrocarbons.
639	They consist only of hydrogen and carbon atoms, all bonds are single bonds, and the carbon atoms are not joined in cyclic structures but instead form a simple chain.
639	They have the general chemical formula CnH2n+2.
639	Alkanes belong to a homologous series of organic compounds in which the members differ by a molecular mass of 14 (one carbon atom of mass 12, and two hydrogen atoms of collective mass 2).
639	There are two main commercial sources: crude oil and natural gas.
639	Each carbon atom has 4 bonds (either C-H or C-C bonds), and each hydrogen atom is joined to a carbon atom (H-C bonds).
639	A series of linked carbon atoms is known as the carbon skeleton or carbon backbone.
639	The number of carbon atoms is used to define the size of the alkane (e.g., C2-alkane).
639	An alkyl group, generally abbreviated with the symbol R, is a functional group or side-chain that, like an alkane, consists solely of single-bonded carbon and hydrogen atoms, for example a methyl or ethyl group.
639	The simplest possible alkane (the parent molecule) is methane, CH4.
639	There is no limit to the number of carbon atoms that can be linked together, the only limitation being that the molecule is acyclic, is saturated, and is a hydrocarbon.
639	Saturated oils and waxes are examples of larger alkanes where the number of carbons in the carbon backbone is greater than 10.
639	Alkanes are not very reactive and have little biological activity.
639	Alkanes can be viewed as a molecular tree upon which can be hung the more biologically active/reactive portions (functional groups) of the molecule.
639	Structure classification Saturated hydrocarbons can be: * linear (general formula ) wherein the carbon atoms are joined in a snake-like structure * branched (general formula , n > 3) wherein the carbon backbone splits off in one or more directions * cyclic (general formula , n > 2) wherein the carbon backbone is linked so as to form a loop.
639	According to the definition by IUPAC, the former two are alkanes, whereas the third group is called cycloalkanes.
639	Saturated hydrocarbons can also combine any of the linear, cyclic (e.g., polycyclic) and branching structures, and they are still alkanes (no general formula) as long as they are acyclic (i.e., having no loops).They also have single covalent bonds between their carbons.
639	Isomerism Alkanes with more than three carbon atoms can be arranged in various different ways, forming structural isomers.
639	The simplest isomer of an alkane is the one in which the carbon atoms are arranged in a single chain with no branches.
639	This isomer is sometimes called the n-isomer (n for "normal", although it is not necessarily the most common).
639	However the chain of carbon atoms may also be branched at one or more points.
639	The number of possible isomers increases rapidly with the number of carbon atoms .
639	For example: * C1: no isomers: methane * C2: no isomers: ethane * C3: no isomers: propane * C4: 2 isomers: n-butane & isobutane * C5: 3 isomers: pentane, isopentane, neopentane * C6: 5 isomers: hexane, 2-Methylpentane, 3-Methylpentane, 2,3-Dimethylbutane & 2,2-Dimethylbutane ne, chiral.
639	For example 3-methylhexane and its higher homologues are chiral due to their stereogenic center at carbon atom number 3.
639	In addition to these isomers, the chain of carbon atoms may form one or more loops.
639	Such compounds are called cycloalkanes.
639	Nomenclature The IUPAC nomenclature (systematic way of naming compounds) for alkanes is based on identifying hydrocarbon chains.
639	Unbranched, saturated hydrocarbon chains are named systematically with a Greek numerical prefix denoting the number of carbons and the suffix "-ane".
639	In 1866, August Wilhelm von Hofmann suggested systematizing nomenclature by using the whole sequence of vowels a, e, i, o and u to create suffixes -ane, -ene, -ine (or -yne), -one, -une, for the hydrocarbons  CnH2n+2, CnH2n, CnH2n-2, CnH2n-4, CnH2n-6.
639	Now, the first three name hydrocarbons with single, double and triple bonds; "-one" represents a ketone; "-ol" represents an alcohol or OH group; "-oxy-" means an ether and refers to oxygen between two carbons, so that methoxy-methane is the IUPAC name for dimethyl ether.
639	It is difficult or impossible to find compounds with more than one IUPAC name.
639	This is because shorter chains attached to longer chains are prefixes and the convention includes brackets.
639	Numbers in the name, referring to which carbon a group is attached to, should be as low as possible, so that 1- is implied and usually omitted from names of organic compounds with only one side-group.
639	Symmetric compounds will have two ways of arriving at the same name.
639	Linear alkanes Straight-chain alkanes are sometimes indicated by the prefix n- (for normal) where a non-linear isomer exists.
639	Although this is not strictly necessary, the usage is still common in cases where there is an important difference in properties between the straight-chain and branched-chain isomers, e.g., n-hexane or 2- or 3-methylpentane.
639	The members of the series (in terms of number of carbon atoms) are named as follows: methane, CH4 - one carbon and four hydrogen ethane, C2H6 - two carbon and six hydrogen propane, C3H8 - three carbon and 8 hydrogen butane, C4H10 - four carbon and 10 hydrogen pentane, C5H12 - five carbon and 12 hydrogen hexane, C6H14 - six carbon and 14 hydrogen These names were derived from methanol, ether, propionic acid and butyric acid, respectively.
639	Alkanes with five or more carbon atoms are named by adding the suffix -ane to the appropriate numerical multiplier prefix with elision of any terminal vowel (-a or -o) from the basic numerical term.
639	Hence, pentane, C5H12; hexane, C6H14; heptane, C7H16; octane, C8H18; etc.
639	The prefix is generally Greek, with the exceptions of nonane which has a Latin prefix, and undecane and tridecane which have mixed-language prefixes.
639	For a more complete list, see List of alkanes.
639	Branched alkanes Simple branched alkanes often have a common name using a prefix to distinguish them from linear alkanes, for example n-pentane, isopentane, and neopentane.
639	IUPAC naming conventions can be used to produce a systematic name.
639	The key steps in the naming of more complicated branched alkanes are as follows: * Identify the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms * Name this longest root chain using standard naming rules * Name each side chain by changing the suffix of the name of the alkane from "-ane" to "-yl" * Number the root chain so that sum of the numbers assigned to each side group will be as low as possible * Number and name the side chains before the name of the root chain * If there are multiple side chains of the same type, use prefixes such as "di-" and "tri-" to indicate it as such, and number each one.
639	Add side chain names in alphabetical (disregarding "di-" etc.
639	Cyclic alkanes So-called cyclic alkanes are, in the technical sense, not alkanes, but cycloalkanes.
639	They are hydrocarbons just like alkanes, but contain one or more rings.
639	Simple cycloalkanes have a prefix "cyclo-" to distinguish them from alkanes.
639	Cycloalkanes are named as per their acyclic counterparts with respect to the number of carbon atoms, e.g., cyclopentane (C5H10) is a cycloalkane with 5 carbon atoms just like pentane (C5H12), but they are joined up in a five-membered ring.
639	In a similar manner, propane and cyclopropane, butane and cyclobutane, etc.
639	Substituted cycloalkanes are named similar to substituted alkanes — the cycloalkane ring is stated, and the substituents are according to their position on the ring, with the numbering decided by Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules.
639	Trivial names The trivial (non-systematic) name for alkanes is paraffins.
639	Together, alkanes are known as the paraffin series.
639	Trivial names for compounds are usually historical artifacts.
639	They were coined before the development of systematic names, and have been retained due to familiar usage in industry.
639	Cycloalkanes are also called naphthenes.
639	It is almost certain that the term paraffin stems from the petrochemical industry.
639	Branched-chain alkanes are called isoparaffins.
639	The use of the term "paraffin" is a general term and often does not distinguish between pure compounds and mixtures of isomers, i.e., compounds with the same chemical formula, e.g., pentane and isopentane.
639	Examples The following trivial names are retained in the IUPAC system: * isobutane for 2-methylpropane * isopentane for 2-methylbutane * neopentane for 2,2-dimethylpropane.
639	Physical properties Table of alkanes Boiling point Alkanes experience inter-molecular van der Waals forces.
639	Stronger inter-molecular van der Waals forces give rise to greater boiling points of alkanes.
639	There are two determinants for the strength of the van der Waals forces: * the number of electrons surrounding the molecule, which increases with the alkane's molecular weight * the surface area of the molecule Under standard conditions, from CH4 to C4H10 alkanes are gaseous; from C5H12 to C17H36 they are liquids; and after C18H38 they are solids.
639	As the boiling point of alkanes is primarily determined by weight, it should not be a surprise that the boiling point has almost a linear relationship with the size (molecular weight) of the molecule.
639	As a rule of thumb, the boiling point rises 20–30 °C for each carbon added to the chain; this rule applies to other homologous series.
639	A straight-chain alkane will have a boiling point higher than a branched-chain alkane due to the greater surface area in contact, thus the greater van der Waals forces, between adjacent molecules.
639	For example, compare isobutane (2-methylpropane) and n-butane (butane), which boil at −12 and 0 °C, and 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,3-dimethylbutane which boil at 50 and 58 °C, respectively.
639	For the latter case, two molecules 2,3-dimethylbutane can "lock" into each other better than the cross-shaped 2,2-dimethylbutane, hence the greater van der Waals forces.
639	On the other hand, cycloalkanes tend to have higher boiling points than their linear counterparts due to the locked conformations of the molecules, which give a plane of intermolecular contact.
639	Melting point The melting points of the alkanes follow a similar trend to boiling points for the same reason as outlined above.
639	That is, (all other things being equal) the larger the molecule the higher the melting point.
639	There is one significant difference between boiling points and melting points.
639	Solids have more rigid and fixed structure than liquids.
639	This rigid structure requires energy to break down.
639	Thus the better put together solid structures will require more energy to break apart.
639	For alkanes, this can be seen from the graph above (i.e., the blue line).
639	The odd-numbered alkanes have a lower trend in melting points than even numbered alkanes.
639	This is because even numbered alkanes pack well in the solid phase, forming a well-organized structure, which requires more energy to break apart.
639	The odd-number alkanes pack less well and so the "looser" organized solid packing structure requires less energy to break apart.
639	The melting points of branched-chain alkanes can be either higher or lower than those of the corresponding straight-chain alkanes, again depending on the ability of the alkane in question to pack well in the solid phase: This is particularly true for isoalkanes (2-methyl isomers), which often have melting points higher than those of the linear analogues.
639	Conductivity and solubility Alkanes do not conduct electricity, nor are they substantially polarized by an electric field.
639	For this reason they do not form hydrogen bonds and are insoluble in polar solvents such as water.
639	Since the hydrogen bonds between individual water molecules are aligned away from an alkane molecule, the coexistence of an alkane and water leads to an increase in molecular order (a reduction in entropy).
639	As there is no significant bonding between water molecules and alkane molecules, the second law of thermodynamics suggests that this reduction in entropy should be minimized by minimizing the contact between alkane and water: Alkanes are said to be hydrophobic in that they repel water.
639	Their solubility in nonpolar solvents is relatively good, a property that is called lipophilicity.
639	Different alkanes are, for example, miscible in all proportions among themselves.
639	The density of the alkanes usually increases with increasing number of carbon atoms, but remains less than that of water.
639	Hence, alkanes form the upper layer in an alkane-water mixture.
639	Molecular geometry The molecular structure of the alkanes directly affects their physical and chemical characteristics.
639	It is derived from the electron configuration of carbon, which has four valence electrons.
639	The carbon atoms in alkanes are always sp3 hybridized, that is to say that the valence electrons are said to be in four equivalent orbitals derived from the combination of tt the valence electrons he 2s orbital and the three 2p orbitals.
639	These orbitals, which have identical energies, are arranged spatially in the form of a tetrahedron, the angle of cos−1(−⅓) ≈ 109.47° between them.
639	Bond lengths and bond angles An alkane molecule has only C – H and C – C single bonds.
639	The former result from the overlap of a sp³-orbital of carbon with the 1s-orbital of a hydrogen; the latter by the overlap of two sp³-orbitals on different carbon atoms.
639	The bond lengths amount to 1.09×10−10 m for a C – H bond and 1.54×10−10 m for a C – C bond.
639	The spatial arrangement of the bonds is similar to that of the four sp³-orbitals—they are tetrahedrally arranged, with an angle of 109.47° between them.
639	Structural formulae that represent the bonds as being at right angles to one another, while both common and useful, do not correspond with the reality.
639	Conformation The structural formula and the bond angles are not usually sufficient to completely describe the geometry of a molecule.
639	There is a further degree of freedom for each carbon – carbon bond: the torsion angle between the atoms or groups bound to the atoms at each end of the bond.
639	The spatial arrangement described by the torsion angles of the molecule is known as its conformation.
639	Ethane forms the simplest case for studying the conformation of alkanes, as there is only one C – C bond.
639	If one looks down the axis of the C – C bond, one will see the so-called Newman projection.
639	The hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have an angle of 120° between them, resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane.
639	However, the torsion angle between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between 0° and 360°.
639	This is a consequence of the free rotation about a carbon – carbon single bond.
639	Despite this apparent freedom, only two limiting conformations are important: eclipsed conformation and staggered conformation.
639	The two conformations, also known as rotamers, differ in energy: The staggered conformation is 12.6 kJ/mol lower in energy (more stable) than the eclipsed conformation (the least stable).
639	This difference in energy between the two conformations, known as the torsion energy, is low compared to the thermal energy of an ethane molecule at ambient temperature.
639	There is constant rotation about the C-C bond.
639	The time taken for an ethane molecule to pass from one staggered conformation to the next, equivalent to the rotation of one CH3-group by 120° relative to the other, is of the order of 10−11 seconds.
639	The case of higher alkanes is more complex but based on similar principles, with the antiperiplanar conformation always being the most favored around each carbon-carbon bond.
639	For this reason, alkanes are usually shown in a zigzag arrangement in diagrams or in models.
639	The actual structure will always differ somewhat from these idealized forms, as the differences in energy between the conformations are small compared to the thermal energy of the molecules: Alkane molecules have no fixed structural form, whatever the models may suggest.
639	Spectroscopic properties Virtually all organic compounds contain carbon – carbon and carbon – hydrogen bonds, and so show some of the features of alkanes in their spectra.
639	Alkanes are notable for having no other groups, and therefore for the absence of other characteristic spectroscopic features.
639	Infrared spectroscopy The carbon–hydrogen stretching mode gives a strong absorption between 2850 and 2960 cm−1, while the carbon–carbon stretching mode absorbs between 800 and 1300 cm−1.
639	The carbon–hydrogen bending modes depend on the nature of the group: methyl groups show bands at 1450 cm−1 and 1375 cm−1, while methylene groups show bands at 1465 cm−1 and 1450 cm−1.
639	Carbon chains with more than four carbon atoms show a weak absorption at around 725 cm−1.
639	NMR spectroscopy The proton resonances of alkanes are usually found at δH 0.5 – 1.5.
639	The carbon-13 resonances depend on the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon: δC   8 – 30 (primary, methyl, -CH3), 15 – 55 (secondary, methylene, -CH2-), 20 – 60 (tertiary, methyne, C-H) and quaternary.
639	The carbon-13 resonance of quaternary carbon atoms is characteristically weak, due to the lack of Nuclear Overhauser effect and the long relaxation time, and can be missed in weak samples, or samples that have not been run for a sufficiently long time.
639	Mass spectrometry Alkanes have a high ionization energy, and the molecular ion is usually weak.
639	The fragmentation pattern can be difficult to interpret, but, in the case of branched chain alkanes, the carbon chain is preferentially cleaved at tertiary or quaternary carbons due to the relative stability of the resulting free radicals.
639	The fragment resulting from the loss of a single methyl group (M−15) is often absent, and other fragment are often spaced by intervals of fourteen mass units, corresponding to sequential loss of CH2-groups.
639	Chemical properties Alkanes are only weakly reactive with ionic and other polar substances.
639	The acid dissociation constant (pKa) values of all alkanes are above 60, hence they are practically inert to acids and bases (see: carbon acids).
639	This inertness is the source of the term paraffins (with the meaning here of "lacking affinity").
639	In crude oil the alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of years.
639	However redox reactions of alkanes, in particular with oxygen and the halogens, are possible as the carbon atoms are in a strongly reduced condition; in the case of methane, the lowest possible oxidation state for carbon (−4) is reached.
639	Reaction with oxygen (if present in sufficient quantity to satisfy the reaction stoichiometry) leads to combustion without any smoke, producing carbon dioxide and water.
639	Free radical halogenation reactions occur with halogens, leading to the production of haloalkanes.
639	In addition, alkanes have been shown to interact with, and bind to, certain transition metal complexes in (See: carbon-hydrogen bond activation).
639	Free radicals, molecules with unpaired electrons, play a large role in most reactions of alkanes, such as cracking and reformation where long-chain alkanes are converted into shorter-chain alkanes and straight-chain alkanes into branched-chain isomers.
639	In highly branched alkanes, the bond angle may differ significantly from the optimal value (109.5°) in order to allow the different groups sufficient space.
639	This causes a tension in the molecule, known as steric hindrance, and can substantially increase the reactivity.
639	Reactions with oxygen (combustion reaction) All alkanes react with oxygen in a combustion reaction, although they become increasingly difficult to ignite as the number of carbon atoms increases.
639	The general equation for complete combustion is: CnH2n+2 + (1.5on for complete combustion is: CnH2n+22 → (n+1)H2O + nCO2 or CnH2n+2 + ((3n+1)/2)O2 → (n+1)H2O + nCO2  In the absence of sufficient oxygen, carbon monoxide or even soot can be formed, as shown below: CnH(2n+2) + (n+0.5)O2 → (n+1)H2O + nCO CnH(2n+2) + (0.5n+0.5)O2 → (n+1)H2O + nC For example methane: 2CH4 + 3O2 → 2CO + 4H2O CH4 + 1.5O2 → CO + 2H2O See the alkane heat of formation table for detailed data.
639	The standard enthalpy change of combustion, ΔcHo, for alkanes increases by about 650 kJ/mol per CH2 group.
639	Branched-chain alkanes have lower values of ΔcHo than straight-chain alkanes of the same number of carbon atoms, and so can be seen to be somewhat more stable.
639	Reactions with halogens Alkanes react with halogens in a so-called free radical halogenation reaction.
639	The hydrogen atoms of the alkane are progressively replaced by halogen atoms.
639	Free-radicals are the reactive species that participate in the reaction, which usually leads to a mixture of products.
639	The reaction is highly exothermic, and can lead to an explosion.
639	These reactions are an important industrial route to halogenated hydrocarbons.
639	There are three steps: * Initiation the halogen radicals form by homolysis.
639	Usually, energy in the form of heat or light is required.
639	Chain reaction or Propagation then takes place—the halogen radical abstracts a hydrogen from the alkane to give an alkyl radical.
639	This reacts further.
639	Chain termination where step the radicals recombine.
639	Experiments have shown that all halogenation produces a mixture of all possible isomers, indicating that all hydrogen atoms are susceptible to reaction.
639	The mixture produced, however, is not a statistical mixture: Secondary and tertiary hydrogen atoms are preferentially replaced due to the greater stability of secondary and tertiary free-radicals.
639	An example can be seen in the monobromination of propane: [In the Figure below, the Statistical Distribution should be 25% and 75%] Cracking Cracking breaks larger molecules into smaller ones.
639	This can be done with a thermal or catalytic method.
639	The thermal cracking process follows a homolytic mechanism with formation of free-radicals.
639	The catalytic cracking process involves the presence of acid catalysts (usually solid acids such as silica-alumina and zeolites), which promote a heterolytic (asymmetric) breakage of bonds yielding pairs of ions of opposite charges, usually a carbocation and the very unstable hydride anion.
639	Carbon-localized free-radicals and cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement, C-C scission in position beta (i.e., cracking) and intra- and intermolecular hydrogen transfer or hydride transfer.
639	In both types of processes, the corresponding reactive intermediates (radicals, ions) are permanently regenerated, and thus they proceed by a self-propagating chain mechanism.
639	The chain of reactions is eventually terminated by radical or ion recombination.
639	Isomerization and reformation Dragan and his colleague were the first to report about isomerization in alkanes.
639	Isomerization and reformation are processes in which straight-chain alkanes are heated in the presence of a platinum catalyst.
639	In isomerization, the alkanes become branched-chain isomers.
639	In other words, it does not lose any carbons or hydrogens, keeping the same molecular weight.
639	In reformation, the alkanes become cycloalkanes or aromatic hydrocarbons, giving off hydrogen as a by-product.
639	Both of these processes raise the octane number of the substance.
639	Butane is the most common alkane that is put under the process of isomerization, as it makes many branched alkanes with high octane numbers.
639	Other reactions Alkanes will react with steam in the presence of a nickel catalyst to give hydrogen.
639	Alkanes can be chlorosulfonated and nitrated, although both reactions require special conditions.
639	The fermentation of alkanes to carboxylic acids is of some technical importance.
639	In the Reed reaction, sulfur dioxide, chlorine and light convert hydrocarbons to sulfonyl chlorides.
639	Nucleophilic Abstraction can be used to separate an alkane from a metal.
639	Alkyl groups can be transferred from one compound to another by transmetalation reactions.
639	Occurrence Occurrence of alkanes in the Universe Alkanes form a small portion of the atmospheres of the outer gas planets such as Jupiter (0.1% methane, 0.0002% ethane), Saturn (0.2% methane, 0.0005% ethane), Uranus (1.99% methane, 0.00025% ethane) and Neptune (1.5% methane, 1.5 ppm ethane).
639	Titan (1.6% methane), a satellite of Saturn, was examined by the Huygens probe, which indicated that Titan's atmosphere periodically rains liquid methane onto the moon's surface.
639	Also on Titan, a methane-spewing volcano was spotted and this volcanism is believed to be a significant source of the methane in the atmosphere.
639	There also appear to be Methane/Ethane lakes near the north polar regions of Titan, as discovered by Cassini's radar imaging.
639	Methane and ethane have also been detected in the tail of the comet Hyakutake.
639	Chemical analysis showed that the abundances of ethane and methane were roughly equal, which is thought to imply that its ices formed in interstellar space, away from the Sun, which would have evaporated these volatile molecules.
639	Alkanes have also been detected in meteorites such as carbonaceous chondrites.
639	Occurrence of alkanes on Earth Traces of methane gas (about 0.0002% or 1745 ppb) occur in the Earth's atmosphere, produced primarily by methanogenic microorganisms, such as Archaea in the gut of ruminants.
639	The most important commercial sources for alkanes are natural gas and oil.
639	Natural gas contains primarily methane and ethane, with some propane and butane: oil is a mixture of liquid alkanes and other hydrocarbons.
639	These hydrocarbons were formed when dead marine animals and plants (zooplankton and phytoplankton) died and sank to the bottom of ancient seas and were covered with sediments in an anoxic environment and converted over many millions of years at high temperatures and high pressure to their current form.
639	Natural gas resulted thereby for example from the following reaction: C6H12O6 → 3CH4 + 3CO2 These hydrocarbon deposits, collected in porous rocks trapped beneath impermeable cap rocks, comprise commercial oil fields.
639	They have formed over millions of years and once exhausted cannot be readily replaced.
639	The depletion of these hydrocarbons reserves is the basis for what is known as the energy crisis.
639	Methane is also present in what is called biogas, produced by animals and decaying matter, which is a possible renewable energy source.
639	Alkanes have a low solubility in water, so the content in the oceans is negligible; however, at high pressures and low temperatures (such as at the bottom of the oceans), methane can co-crystallize with water to form a solid methane clathrate (methane hydrate).
639	Although this cannot be commercially exploited at the present time, the amount of combustible energy of the known methane clathrate fields exceeds the energy content of all the natural gas and oil deposits put together.
639	Methane extracted from methane clathrate is therefore a candidate for future fuels.
639	Biological occurrence Although alkanes occur in nature in various way, they do not rank biologically among the essential materials.
639	Cycloalkanes with 14 to 18 carbon atoms occur in musk, extracted from deer of the family Moschidae.
639	All further information refers to (acyclic) alkanes.
639	Bacteria and archaea Certain types of bacteria can metabolize alkanes: they prefer even-numbered carbon chains as they are easier to degrade than odd-numbered chains.
639	On the other hand, certain archaea, the methanogens, produce large quantities of methane by the metabolism of carbon dioxide or other oxidized organic compounds.
639	The energy is released by the oxidation of hydrogen: CO2 + 4H2 → CH4 + 2H2O Methanogens are also the producers of marsh gas in wetlands, and release about two billion tonnes of methane per year—the atmospheric content of this gas is produced nearly exclusively by them.
639	The methane output of cattle and other herbivores, which can release up to 150 liters per day, and of termites, is also due to methanogens.
639	They also produce this simplest of all alkanes in the intestines of humans.
639	Methanogenic archaea are, hence, at the end of the carbon cycle, with carbon being released back into the atmosphere after having been fixed by photosynthesis.
639	It is probable that our current deposits of natural gas were formed in a similar way.
639	Fungi and plants Alkanes also play a role, if a minor role, in the biology of the three eukaryotic groups of organisms: fungi, plants and animals.
639	Some specialized yeasts, e.g., Candida tropicale, Pichia sp., Rhodotorula sp., can use alkanes as a source of carbon and/or energy.
639	The fungus Amorphotheca resinae prefers the longer-chain alkanes in aviation fuel, and can cause serious problems for aircraft in tropical regions.
639	In plants, the solid long-chain alkanes are found in the plant cuticle and epicuticular wax of many species, but are only rarely major constituents.
639	They protect the plant against water loss, prevent the leaching of important minerals by the rain, and protect against bacteria, fungi, and harmful insects.
639	The carbon chains in plant alkanes are usually odd-numbered, between twenty-seven and thirty-three carbon atoms in length and are made by the plants by decarboxylation of even-numbered fatty acids.
639	The exact composition of the layer of wax is not only species-dependent, but changes also with the season and such environmental factors as lighting conditions, temperature or humidity.
639	More volatile short-chain alkanes are also produced by and found in plant tissues.
639	The Jeffrey pine is noted for producing exceptionally high levels of n-heptane in its resin, for which reason its distillate was designated as the zero point for one octane rating.
639	Floral scents have also long been known to contain volatile alkane components, and n-nonane is a significant component in the scent of some roses.
639	Emission of gaseous and volatile alkanes such as ethane, pentane, and hexane by plants has also been documented at low levels, though they are not generally considered to be a major component of biogenic air pollution.
639	Edible vegetable oils also typically contain small fractions of biogenic alkanes with a wide spectrum of carbon numbers, mainly 8 to 35, usually peaking in the low to upper 20s, with concentrations up to dozens of milligrams per kilogram (parts per million by weight) and sometimes over a hundred for the total alkane fraction.
639	Animals Alkanes are found in animal products, although they are less important than unsaturated hydrocarbons.
639	One example is the shark liver oil, which is approximately 14% pristane (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane, C19H40).
639	They are important as pheromones, chemical messenger materials, on which insects depend for communication.
639	In some species, e.g.
639	Xylotrechus colonus, pentacosane (C25H52), 3-methylpentaicosane (C26H54) and 9-methylpentaicosane (C26H54) are transferred by body contact.
639	With others like the tsetse fly Glossina morsitans morsitans, the pheromone contains the four alkanes 2-methylheptadecane (C18H38), 17,21-dimethylheptatriacontane (C39H80), 15,19-dimethylheptatriacontane (C39H80) and 15,19,23-trimethylheptatriacontane (C40H82), and acts by smell over longer distances.
639	Waggle-dancing honey bees produce and release two alkanes, tricosane and pentacosane.
639	Ecological relations One example, in which both plant and animal alkanes play a role, is the ecological relationship between the sand bee (Andrena nigroaenea) and the early spider orchid (Ophrys sphegodes); the latter is dependent for pollination on the former.
639	Sand bees use pheromones in order to identify a mate; in the case of A.
639	C23H48), pentacosane (C25H52) and heptacosane (C27H56) in the ratio 3:3:1, and males are attracted by specifically this odor.
639	The orchid takes advantage of this mating arrangement to get the male bee to collect and disseminate its pollen; parts of its flower not only resemble the appearance of sand bees, but also produce large quantities of the three alkanes in the same ratio as female sand bees.
639	As a result numerous males are lured to the blooms and attempt to copulate with their imaginary partner: although this endeavor is not crowned with success for the bee, it allows the orchid to transfer its pollen, which will be dispersed after the departure of the frustrated male to different blooms.
639	Production Petroleum refining As stated earlier, the most important source of alkanes is natural gas and crude oil.
639	Alkanes are separated in an oil refinery by fractional distillation and processed into many different products.
639	Fischer-Tropsch The Fischer-Tropsch process is a method to synthesize liquid hydrocarbons, including alkanes, from carbon monoxide and hydrogen.
639	This method is used to produce substitutes for petroleum distillates.
639	Laboratory preparation There is usually little need for alkanes to be synthesized in the laboratory, since they are usually commercially available.
639	Also, alkanes are generally non-reactive chemically or biologically, and do not undergo functional group interconversions cleanly.
639	When alkanes are produced in the laboratory, it is often a side-product of a reaction.
639	For example, the use of n-butyllithium as a strong base gives the conjugate acid, n-butane as a side-product: C4H9Li + H2O → C4H10 + LiOH However, at times it may be desirable to make a portion of a molecule into an alkane like functionality (alkyl group) using the above or similar methods.
639	For example, an ethyl group is an alkyl group; when this is attached to a hydroxy group, it gives ethanol, which is not an alkane.
639	To do so, the best-known methods are hydrogenation of alkenes: RCHCH2 + H2 → RCH2CH3 (R   alkyl) Alkanes or alkyl groups can also be prepared directly from alkyl halides in the Corey-House-Posner-Whitesides reaction.
639	The Barton-McCombie deoxygenation removes hydroxyl groups from alcohols e.g.
639	Clemmensen reduction removes carbonyl groups from aldehydes and ketones to form alkanes or alkyl-substituted compounds e.g.: Applications The applications of a certain alkane can be determined quite well according to the number of carbon atoms.
639	The first four alkanes are used mainly for heating and cooking purposes, and in some countries for electricity generation.
639	Methane and ethane are the main components of natural gas; they are normally stored as gases under pressure.
639	It is, however, easier to transport them as liquids: This requires both compression and cooling of the gas.
639	Propane and butane can be liquefied at fairly low pressures, and are well known as liquified petroleum gas (LPG).
639	Propane, for example, is used in the propane gas burner and as a fuel for cars, butane in disposable cigarette lighters.
639	The two alkanes are used as propellants in aerosol sprays.
639	From pentane to octane the alkanes are reasonably volatile liquids.
639	They are used as fuels in internal combustion engines, as they vaporise easily on entry into the combustion chamber without forming droplets, which would impair the uniformity of the combustion.
639	Branched-chain alkanes are preferred as they are much less prone to premature ignition, which causes knocking, than their straight-chain homologues.
639	This propensity to premature ignition is measured by the octane rating of the fuel, where 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (isooctane) has an arbitrary value of 100, and heptane has a value of zero.
639	Apart from their use as fuel) has an arbits, the middle alkanes are also good solvents for nonpolar substances.
639	Alkanes from nonane to, for instance, hexadecane (an alkane with sixteen carbon atoms) are liquids of higher viscosity, less and less suitable for use in gasoline.
639	They form instead the major part of diesel and aviation fuel.
639	Diesel fuels are characterized by their cetane number, cetane being an old name for hexadecane.
639	However, the higher melting points of these alkanes can cause problems at low temperatures and in polar regions, where the fuel becomes too thick to flow correctly.
639	Alkanes from hexadecane upwards form the most important components of fuel oil and lubricating oil.
639	In the latter function, they work at the same time as anti-corrosive agents, as their hydrophobic nature means that water cannot reach the metal surface.
639	Many solid alkanes find use as paraffin wax, for example, in candles.
639	This should not be confused however with true wax, which consists primarily of esters.
639	Alkanes with a chain length of approximately 35 or more carbon atoms are found in bitumen, used, for example, in road surfacing.
639	However, the higher alkanes have little value and are usually split into lower alkanes by cracking.
639	Some synthetic polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene are alkanes with chains containing hundreds of thousands of carbon atoms.
639	These materials are used in innumerable applications, and billions of kilograms of these materials are made and used each year.
639	Environmental transformations When released in the environment, alkanes don't undergo rapid biodegradation, because they have no functional groups (like hydroxyl or carbonyl) that are needed by most organisms in order to metabolize the compound.
639	However, some bacteria can metabolize some alkanes (especially those linear and short), by oxidizing the terminal carbon atom.
639	The product is an alcohol, that could be next oxidized to an aldehyde, and finally to a carboxylic acid.
639	The resulting fatty acid could be metabolized through the fatty acid degradation pathway.
639	Hazards Methane is explosive when mixed with air (1 – 8% CH4).
639	Other lower alkanes can also form explosive mixtures with air.
639	The lighter liquid alkanes are highly flammable, although this risk decreases with the length of the carbon chain.
639	Pentane, hexane, heptane, and octane are classed as dangerous for the environment and harmful.
639	The straight-chain isomer of hexane is a neurotoxin.
639	Considerations for detection /risk control: * Methane is lighter than air (possibility of accumulation on roofs) * Ethane is slightly Heavier than air (possibility of pooling at ground levels / pits) * Propane is Heavier than air (possibility of pooling at ground levels / pits) * Butane is Heavier than air (possibility of pooling at ground levels / pits)
640	In United States appellate procedure, an appeal is a petition for review of a case that has been decided by a court of law.
640	The petition is made to a higher court for the purpose of overturning the lower court's decision.
640	The specific procedures for appealing, including even whether there is a right of appeal from a particular type of decision, can vary greatly from state to state.
640	The right to file an appeal can also vary from state to state; for example, the New Jersey Constitution vests judicial power in a Supreme Court, a Superior Court, and other courts of limited jurisdiction, with an appellate court being part of the Superior Court.
640	The nature of an appeal can vary greatly depending on the type of case and the rules of the court in the jurisdiction where the case was prosecuted.
640	There are many types of standard of review for appeals, such as de novo and abuse of discretion.
640	An appellate court is a court that hears cases on appeal from another court.
640	Depending on the particular legal rules that apply to each circumstance, a party to a court case who is unhappy with the result might be able to challenge that result in an appellate court on specific grounds.
640	These grounds typically could include errors of law, fact, procedure or due process.
640	In different jurisdictions, appellate courts are also called appeals courts, courts of appeals, superior courts, or supreme courts.
640	Access to appellant status A party who files an appeal is called an "appellant", "plaintiff in error", "petitioner" or "pursuer", and a party on the other side is called a "appellee".
640	A "cross-appeal" is an appeal brought by the respondent.
640	For example, suppose at trial the judge found for the plaintiff and ordered the defendant to pay $50,000.
640	If the defendant files an appeal arguing that he should not have to pay any money, then the plaintiff might file a cross-appeal arguing that the defendant should have to pay $200,000 instead of $50,000.
640	The appellant is the party who, having lost part or all their claim in a lower court decision, is appealing to a higher court to have their case reconsidered.
640	This is usually done on the basis that the lower court judge erred in the application of law, but it may also be possible to appeal on the basis of court misconduct, or that a finding of fact was entirely unreasonable to make on the evidence.
640	The appellant in the new case can be either the plaintiff (or claimant), defendant, third-party intervenor, or respondent (appellee) from the lower case, depending on who was the losing party.
640	The winning party from the lower court, however, is now the respondent.
640	In unusual cases the appellant can be the victor in the court below, but still appeal.
640	An appellee is the party to an appeal in which the lower court judgment was in its favor.
640	The appellee is required to respond to the petition, oral arguments, and legal briefs of the appellant.
640	In general, the appellee takes the procedural posture that the lower court's decision should be affirmed.
640	Ability to appeal An appeal "as of right" is one that is guaranteed by statute or some underlying constitutional or legal principle.
640	The appellate court cannot refuse to listen to the appeal.
640	An appeal "by leave" or "permission" requires the appellant to obtain leave to appeal; in such a situation either or both of the lower court and the appellate court may have the discretion to grant or refuse the appellant's demand to appeal the lower court's decision.
640	In the Supreme Court, review in most cases is available only if the Court exercises its discretion and grants a writ of certiora in most cri.
640	In tort, equity, or other civil matters either party to a previous case may file an appeal.
640	In criminal matters, however, the state or prosecution generally has no appeal "as of right".
640	And due to the double jeopardy principle, the state or prosecution may never appeal a jury or bench verdict of acquittal.
640	But in some jurisdictions, the state or prosecution may appeal "as of right" from a trial court's dismissal of an indictment in whole or in part or from a trial court's granting of a defendant's suppression motion.
640	Likewise, in some jurisdictions, the state or prosecution may appeal an issue of law "by leave" from the trial court and/or the appellate court.
640	The ability of the prosecution to appeal a decision in favor of a defendant varies significantly internationally.
640	All parties must present grounds to appeal, or it will not be heard.
640	By convention in some law reports, the appellant is named first.
640	This can mean that where it is the defendant who appeals, the name of the case in the law reports reverses (in some cases twice) as the appeals work their way up the court hierarchy.
640	This is not always true, however.
640	In the federal courts, the parties' names always stay in the same order as the lower court when an appeal is taken to the circuit courts of appeals, and are re-ordered only if the appeal reaches the Supreme Court.
640	Direct or collateral: Appealing criminal convictions Many jurisdictions recognize two types of appeals, particularly in the criminal context.
640	The first is the traditional "direct" appeal in which the appellant files an appeal with the next higher court of review.
640	The second is the collateral appeal or post-conviction petition, in which the petitioner-appellant files the appeal in a court of first instance—usually the court that tried the case.
640	The key distinguishing factor between direct and collateral appeals is that the former occurs in state courts, and the latter in federal courts.
640	Relief in post-conviction is rare and is most often found in capital or violent felony cases.
640	The typical scenario involves an incarcerated defendant locating DNA evidence demonstrating the defendant's actual innocence.
640	Appellate review "Appellate review" is the general term for the process by which courts with appellate jurisdiction take jurisdiction of matters decided by lower courts.
640	It is distinguished from judicial review, which refers to the court's overriding constitutional or statutory right to determine if a legislative act or administrative decision is defective for jurisdictional or other reasons (which may vary by jurisdiction).
640	In most jurisdictions the normal and preferred way of seeking appellate review is by filing an appeal of the final judgment.
640	Generally, an appeal of the judgment will also allow appeal of all other orders or rulings made by the trial court in the course of the case.
640	This is because such orders cannot be appealed "as of right".
640	However, certain critical interlocutory court orders, such as the denial of a request for an interim injunction, or an order holding a person in contempt of court, can be appealed immediately although the case may otherwise not have been fully disposed of.
640	There are two distinct forms of appellate review, "direct" and "collateral".
640	For example, a criminal defendant may be convicted in state court, and lose on "direct appeal" to higher state appellate courts, and if unsuccessful, mount a "collateral" action such as filing for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal courts.
640	Generally speaking, "[d]irect appeal statutes afford defendants the opportunity to challenge the merits of a judgment and allege errors of law or fact.
640	Collateral review], on the other hand, provide[s] an independent and civil inquiry into the validity of a conviction and sentence, and as such are generally limited to challenges to constitutional, jurisdictional, or other fundamental violations that occurred at trial."
640	"Graham v.
640	Borgen", 483 F 3d.
640	Cir.
640	In Anglo-American common law courts, appellate review of lower court decisions may also be obtained by filing a petition for review by prerogative writ in certain cases.
640	There is no corresponding right to a writ in any pure or continental civil law legal systems, though some mixed systems such as Quebec recognize these prerogative writs.
640	Direct Appeal After exhausting the first appeal as of right, defendants usually petition the highest state court to review the decision.
640	This appeal is known as a direct appeal.
640	The highest state court, generally known as the Supreme Court, exercises discretion over whether it will review the case.
640	On direct appeal, a prisoner challenges the grounds of the conviction based on an error that occurred at trial or some other stage in the adjudicative process.
640	Preservation Issues An appellant's claim(s) must usually be preserved at trial.
640	This mean that the defendant had to object to the error when it occurred in the trial.
640	Because constitutional claims are of great magnitude, appellate courts might be more lenient to review the claim even if it was not preserved.
640	For example Connecticut applies the following standard to review unpreserved claims: 1.the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; 2.
640	State Post Conviction Relief: Collateral Appeal All States have a post-conviction relief process.
640	Similar to federal post-conviction relief, an appellant can petition the court to correct alleged fundamental errors that were not corrected on direct review.
640	Habeas Corpus Notice of appeal A "notice of appeal" is a form or document that in many cases is required to begin an appeal.
640	The form is completed by the appellant or by the appellant's legal representative.
640	The nature of this form can vary greatly from country to country and from court to court within a country.
640	The specific rules of the legal system will dictate exactly how the appeal is officially begun.
640	For example, the appellant might have to file the notice of appeal with the appellate court, or with the court from which the appeal is taken, or both.
640	Some courts have samples of a notice of appeal on the court's own web site.
640	In New Jersey, for example, the Administrative Office of the Court has promulgated a form of notice of appeal for use by appellants, though using this exact form is not mandatory and the failure to use it is not a jurisdictional defect provided that all pertinent information is set forth in whatever form of notice of appeal is used.
640	The deadline for beginning an appeal can often be very short: traditionally, it is measured in days, not months.
640	This can vary from country to country, as well as within a country, depending on the specific rules in force.
640	In the U.S.
642	Generally, an answer is a reply to a question or is a solution, a retaliation, or a response that is relevant to the said question.
642	In law, an answer was originally a solemn assertion in opposition to someone or something, and thus generally any counter-statement or defense, a reply to a question or response, or objection, or a correct solution of a problem.
642	In the common law, an answer is the first pleading by a defendant, usually filed and served upon the plaintiff within a certain strict time limit after a civil complaint or criminal information or indictment has been served upon the defendant.
642	It may have been preceded by an optional "pre-answer" motion to dismiss or demurrer; if such a motion is unsuccessful, the defendant must file an answer to the complaint or risk an adverse default judgment.
642	In a criminal case, there is usually an arraignment or some other kind of appearance before the defendant comes to court.
642	The pleading in the criminal case, which is entered on the record in open court, is usually either guilty or not guilty.
642	Generally speaking in private, civil cases there is no plea entered of guilt or innocence.
642	There is only a judgment that grants money damages or some other kind of equitable remedy such as restitution or a permanent injunction.
642	Criminal cases may lead to fines or other punishment, such as imprisonment.
642	The famous Latin Responsa nishmentPrudentium ("answers of the learned ones") were the accumulated views of many successive generations of Roman lawyers, a body of legal opinion which gradually became authoritative.
642	In music an "answer" (also known as countersubject) is the technical name in counterpoint for the repetition or modification by one part or instrument of a theme proposed by another.
643	An appellate court, commonly called an appeals court or court of appeals (American English) or appeal court (British English) or court of second instance or second instance court, is any court of law that is empowered to hear an appeal of a trial court or other lower tribunal.
643	In most jurisdictions, the court system is divided into at least three levels: the trial court, which initially hears cases and reviews evidence and testimony to determine the facts of the case; at least one intermediate appellate court; and a supreme court (or court of last resort) which primarily reviews the decisions of the intermediate courts.
643	A jurisdiction's supreme court is that jurisdiction's highest appellate court.
643	Appellate courts nationwide can operate by varying rules.
643	The authority of appellate courts to review decisions of lower courts varies widely from one jurisdiction to another.
643	In some places, the appellate court has limited powers of review.
643	"Generally speaking, an appellate court's judgment provides 'the final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed, setting out with specificity the court's determination that the action appealed from should be affirmed, reversed, remanded or modified'".
643	United States  In the United States, both state and federal appellate courts are usually restricted to examining whether the lower court made the correct legal determinations, rather than hearing direct evidence and determining what the facts of the case were.
643	Furthermore, U.S.
643	Hence, such an appellate court will not consider an appellant's argument if it is based on a theory that is raised for the first time in the appeal.
643	In most U.S.
643	U.S.
643	This means that a party who is unsatisfied with the outcome of a trial may bring an appeal to contest that outcome.
643	However, appeals may be costly, and the appellate court must find an error on the part of the court below that justifies upsetting the verdict.
643	Therefore, only a small proportion of trial court decisions result in appeals.
643	Some appellate courts, particularly supreme courts, have the power of discretionary review, meaning that they can decide whether they will hear an appeal brought in a particular case.
643	Institutional titles Many U.S.
643	Historically, others have titled their appellate court a court of errors (or court of errors and appeals), on the premise that it was intended to correct errors made by lower courts.
643	Examples of such courts include the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals (which existed from 1844 to 1947), the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors (which has been renamed the Connecticut Supreme Court), the Kentucky Court of Errors (renamed the Kentucky Supreme Court), and the Mississippi High Court of Errors and Appeals (since renamed the Supreme Court of Mississippi).
643	In some jurisdictions, courts able to hear appeals are known as an appellate division.
643	The phrase "court of appeals" most often refers to intermediate appellate courts.
643	However, the New York system is different: the "New York Court of Appeals" is the highest appellate court; and the phrase "New York Supreme Court" applies to the trial court of general jurisdiction.
643	Depending on the system, certain courts may serve as both trial courts and appellate courts, hearing appeals of decisions made by courts with more limited jurisdiction.
643	Some jurisdictions have specialized appellate courts, such as the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which only hears appeals raised in criminal cases, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which has general jurisdiction but derives most of its caseload from patent cases, on one hand, and appeals from the Court of Federal Claims on the other.
649	Arraignment is a formal reading of a criminal charging document in the presence of the defendant to inform the defendant of the charges against him or her.
649	In response to arraignment, the accused is expected to enter a plea.
649	Acceptable pleas vary among jurisdictions, but they generally include "guilty", "not guilty", and the peremptory pleas (or pleas in bar) setting out reasons why a trial cannot proceed.
649	Pleas of "nolo contendere" (no contest) and the "Alford plea" are allowed in some circumstances.
649	In England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Australia, arraignment is the first of eleven stages in a criminal trial, and involves the clerk of the court reading out the indictment.
649	The defendant is asked whether he or she pleads guilty or not guilty to each charge.
649	In federal courts of the United States, arraignment takes place in two stages.
649	The first is called the initial arraignment and must take place within 48 hours of an individual's arrest, 72 hours if the individual was arrested on the weekend and not able to go before a judge until Monday.
649	During this arraignment the defendant is informed of the pending legal charges and is informed of his or her right to retain counsel.
649	The presiding judge also decides at what amount, if any, to set bail.
649	During the second arraignment, a post-indictment arraignment or PIA, the defendant is allowed to enter a plea.
649	Form of the arraignment The wording of the arraignment varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
649	However, it generally conforms with the following principles: # The accused person (defendant) is addressed by name; # The charge against the accused person is read, including the alleged date, time, and place of offense (and sometimes the names of the state's witnesses and the range of punishment for the charge(s)); and, # The accused person is asked formally how he or she pleads.
649	Video arraignment Video arraignment is the act of conducting the arraignment process using some form of videoconferencing technology.
649	Use of video arraignment system allows the courts to conduct the requisite arraignment process without the need to transport the defendant to the courtroom by using an audio-visual link between the location where the offender is being held and the courtroom.
649	Use of the video arraignment process addresses the problems associated with having to transport offenders.
649	The transportation of offenders requires time, puts additional demands on the public safety organizations to provide for the safety of the public, court personnel and for the security of the offender population.
649	It also addresses the rising costs of transportation.
649	Guilty and not-guilty pleas If the defendant pleads guilty, an evidentiary hearing usually follows.
649	The court is not required to accept a guilty plea.
649	During the hearing, the judge assesses the offense, the mitigating factors, and the defendant's character, and passes sentence.
649	If the defendant pleads not guilty, a date is set for a preliminary hearing or a trial.
649	In the past, a defendant who refused to plead (or "stood mute") was subject to peine forte et dure (Law French for "strong and hard punishment").
649	Today in common-law jurisdictions, the court enters a plea of not guilty for a defendant who refuses to enter a plea.
649	The rationale for this is the defendant's right to silence.
649	Pre-trial release This is also often the stage at which arguments for or against pre-trial release and bail may be made, depending on the alleged crime and jurisdiction.
649	United States Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure Under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, "arraignment shall [...] [consist of an] open [...] reading [of] the indictment [...] to the defendant [...] and call[] on him to plead thereto.
649	He/she shall be given a copy of the indictment [...] before he/she is called upon to plead."
651	"America the Beautiful" is an American patriotic song.
651	The lyrics were written by Katharine Lee Bates, and the music was composed by church organist and choirmaster Samuel A.
651	Ward.
651	Bates originally wrote the words as a poem, Pikes Peak, first published in the Fourth of July edition of the church periodical The Congregationalist in 1895.
651	At that time, the poem was titled America for publication.
651	Ward had originally written the music, Materna, for the hymn O Mother dear, Jerusalem in 1882, though it was not first published until 1892.
651	Ward's music combined with the Bates poem was first published in 1910 and titled America the Beautiful.
651	The song is one of the most popular of the many American patriotic songs.
651	History In 1893, at the age of thirty-three, Bates, an English professor at Wellesley College, had taken a train trip to Colorado Springs, Colorado, to teach a short summer school session at Colorado College.
651	Several of the sights on her trip inspired her, and they found their way into her poem, including the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, the "White City" with its promise of the future contained within its alabaster buildings; the wheat fields of America's heartland Kansas, through which her train was riding on July 16; and the majestic view of the Great Plains from high atop Zebulon's Pikes Peak.
651	On the pinnacle of that mountain, the words of the poem started to come to her, and she wrote them down upon returning to her hotel room at the original Antlers Hotel.
651	The poem was initially published two years later in The Congregationalist, to commemorate the Fourth of July.
651	It quickly caught the public's fancy.
651	Amended versions were published in 1904 and 1913.
651	Several existing pieces of music were adapted to the poem.
651	A hymn tune composed by Samuel A.
651	Ward was generally considered the best music as early as 1910 and is still the popular tune today.
651	Just as Bates had been inspired to write her poem, Ward too was inspired to compose his tune.
651	The tune came to him while he was on a ferryboat trip from Coney Island back to his home in New York City, after a leisurely summer day in 1882, and he immediately wrote it down.
651	He was so anxious to capture the tune in his head, he asked fellow passenger friend Harry Martin for his shirt cuff to write the tune on.
651	He composed the tune for the old hymn "O Mother Dear, Jerusalem", retitling the work "Materna".
651	Ward's music combined with Bates' poem were first published together in 1910 and titled, America the Beautiful.
651	Ward died in 1903, not knowing the national stature his music would attain, as the music was only first applied to the song in 1904.
651	Bates was more fortunate, as the song's popularity was well established by the time of her death in 1929.
651	At various times in the more than 100 years that have elapsed since the song was written, particularly during the John F.
651	Kennedy administration, there have been efforts to give "America the Beautiful" legal status either as a national hymn, or as a national anthem equal to, or in place of, "The Star-Spangled Banner", but so far this has not succeeded.
651	Proponents prefer "America the Beautiful" for various reasons, saying it is easier to sing, more melodic, and more adaptable to new orchestrations while still remaining as easily recognizable as "The Star-Spangled Banner."
651	Some prefer "America the Beautiful" over "The Star-Spangled Banner" due to the latter's war-oriented imagery.
651	Others prefer "The Star-Spangled Banner" for the same reason.
651	While that national dichotomy has stymied any effort at changing the tradition of the national anthem, "America the Beautiful" continues to be held in high esteem by a large number of Americans.
651	When Richard Nixon visited China in 1972, this song was played as the welcome music.
651	The song is often included in songbooks in a wide variety of religious congregations in the United States.

651	Popular versions Possibly the most notable current version of "America the Beautiful" is the setting for band and symphonic orchestra by the late arranger/conductor/composer Carmen Dragon.
651	Performed thousands of times in recent years, Mr.
651	Dragon's arrangement has been played for state occasions such as the memorial services for Presidents Ford and Reagan and at tribute concerts for events such as the Oklahoma City bombing and 9/11.
651	Three different renditions of the song have entered the Hot Country Shoma Citongs charts.
651	The first was by Charlie Rich, which went to number 22 in 1976.
651	A second, by Mickey Newbury, peaked at number 82 in 1980.
651	An all-star version of "America the Beautiful" performed by country singers Trace Adkins, Billy Dean, Vince Gill, Carolyn Dawn Johnson, Toby Keith, Brenda Lee, Lonestar, Martina McBride, Jamie O'Neal, Kenny Rogers and Keith Urban reached number 58 in July 2001.
651	The song re-entered the chart following the September 11 terrorist attacks.
651	Popularity of the song increased greatly following the September 11, 2001 attacks; at some sporting events it was sung in addition to the traditional singing of the national anthem.
651	During the first taping of the Late Show with David Letterman following the attacks, CBS newsman Dan Rather cried briefly as he quoted the fourth verse.
651	Ray Charles is credited with the song's most well known rendition in current times (although Elvis Presley had success with it in the 1970s).
651	Charles' recording is very commonly played at major sporting and entertainment events, such as the Super Bowl, and WrestleMania; Charles gave a live performance of the song prior to Super Bowl XXXV, the last Super Bowl played before the September 11 terrorist attacks, as well as during Game 2 of the 2001 World Series after the attacks.
651	He places the third verse first, after which he sings the usual first verse.
651	In the third verse (see above), the author scolds the materialistic and self-serving robber barons of her day, and urges America to live up to its noble ideals and to honor, with both word and deed, the memory of those who died for their country.
651	He also performed the song on Red Sox opening day at Fenway Park in 2003, though the game was eventually rained out.
651	A version with Alicia Keys was included in Charles' 2005 duets album Genius & Friends.
651	Symbolically, Marian Anderson (a noted opera singer of her day) sang a rendition of "America the Beautiful" on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in 1939 after being refused use of Constitution Hall by the Daughters of the American Revolution because of her skin color.
651	Years later, in 1986, concert singer Robbie Britt sang the song at the beginning of a Professional Bowlers Tour telecat on ESPN prior to the first match, with that telecast airing just around the 4th of July.
651	In 2009, on her album Running for the Drum, Buffy Sainte-Marie released a new version of "America the Beautiful".
651	Her version contained some new lyrics, as well as a small modification of the melody.
651	This version includes only two verses, the second of which returns to Bates' original intention (see below).
651	O beautiful for vision clear, That sees beyond the years, The nightime sky, our hopes that fly, Undimmed by human tears.
651	America!
651	America!
651	God shed His grace on thee, 'Til selfish gain no longer stain, The banner of the free.
651	And crown thy good with brotherhood, From sea to shining sea.
651	Wellesley students honor Bates with a version at graduation, substituting And crown thy good with SISTERhood, From sea to shining sea.
651	Idioms "From sea to shining sea" is an American idiom meaning from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean (or vice versa).
651	Many songs have used this term, including the American patriotic songs "America, The Beautiful" and "God Bless the USA".
651	In addition to these, it is also featured in Schoolhouse Rock's "Elbow Room".
651	A term similar to this is the Canadian motto A Mari Usque Ad Mare ("From sea to sea.") "Purple mountain majesties" refers to the shade of the Rocky Mountains, which Kate looked at while writing the poem.
651	Books *Lynn Sherr's 2001 book America the Beautiful discusses the origins of the song and the backgrounds of its authors in depth.
651	The book points out that the poem has the same meter as that of "Auld Lang Syne"; the songs can be sung interchangeably.
651	Additionally, Sherr points out that this was the original third verse written by Bates: America!
651	America!
651	God shed His grace on thee, 'Til selfish gain no longer stain, The banner of the free.
651	Barbara Younger has written a children's book about the writing of the song: Purple Mountain Majesties: The Story of Katharine Lee Bates and "America the Beautiful".
651	The book has illustrations by artist Stacey Schuett.
651	This song is also used in Ellen Raskin's The Westing Game".
653	Assistive Technology is an umbrella term that includes assistive, adaptive, and rehabilitative devices for people with disabilities and also includes the process used in selecting, locating, and using them.
653	AT promotes greater independence by enabling people to perform tasks that they were formerly unable to accomplish, or had great difficulty accomplishing, by providing enhancements to, or changing methods of interacting with, the technology needed to accomplish such tasks.
653	Assistive Technology anof interacd Adaptive Technology  The term Adaptive Technology is often used as the synonym for Assistive Technology, however, they are different terms.
653	Assistive Technology refers to “any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially, modified, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities”, while Adaptive Technology covers items that are specifically designed for persons with disabilities and would seldom be used by non-disabled persons.
653	In other words, “Assistive Technology is any object or system that increases or maintains the capabilities of people with disabilities”, while Adaptive Technology is “any object or system that is specifically designed for the purpose of increasing or maintaining the capabilities of people with disabilities”.
653	Consequently, Adaptive Technology is a subset of Assistive Technology.
653	Adaptive Technology often refers specifically to electronic and Information Technology access.
653	Mobility impairment and wheelchairs Wheelchairs are devices that can be manually propelled or electrically propelled and that include a seating system and are designed to be a substitute for the normal mobility that most people enjoy.
653	Wheelchairs and other mobility devices allow people to perform mobility related Activities of Daily Living which include Feeding, Toileting, Dressing Grooming and Bathing.
653	The devices comes in a number of variations where they can be propelled either by hand or by motors where the occupant uses electrical controls to manage motors and seating control actuators through a joystick or other input devices.
653	Often there are handles behind the seat for someone else to do the pushing or input devices for caregivers.
653	Wheelchairs are used by people for whom walking is difficult or impossible due to illness, injury, or disability.
653	People with both sitting and walking disability often need to use a wheelchair or walker.
653	Mobility impairment and walkers A walker or walking frame or Rollator is a tool for disabled people who need additional support to maintain balance or stability while walking.
653	It consists of a frame that is about waist high, approximately twelve inches deep and slightly wider than the user.
653	Walkers are also available in other sizes such as Pediatric or Bariatric.
653	Modern walkers are height adjustable.
653	The front two legs of the walker may or may not have wheels attached depending on the strength and abilities of the person using it.
653	It is also common to see caster wheels or glides on the back legs of a walker with wheels on the front.
653	Personal Emergency Response Systems Personal Emergency Response Systems (PERS), or Telecare (UK term), are a particular sort of Assistive Technology that use electronic sensors connected to an alarm system to help caregivers manage risk and help vulnerable people stay independent at home longer.
653	An example would be the systems being put in place for senior people such as fall detectors, thermometers (for hypothermia risk), flooding and unlit gas sensors (for people with mild dementia).
653	Notably, these alerts can be customized to the particular person's risks.
653	When the alert is triggered, a message is sent to a caregiver or contact center who can respond appropriately.
653	Accessibility software In human–computer interaction, computer accessibility (also known as Accessible computing) refers to the accessibility of a computer system to all people, regardless of disability or severity of impairment, examples include Web accessibility guidelines.
653	Another approach is for the user to present a token to the computer terminal, such as a smart card, that has configuration information to adjust the computer speed, text size, etc.
653	This is useful where users want to access public computer based terminals in Libraries, ATM, Information kiosks etc.
653	The concept is encompassed by the CEN EN 1332-4 Identification Card Systems - Man-Machine Interface.
653	This development of this standard has been supported in Europe by SNAPI and has been successfully incorporated into the Lasseo specifications, but with limited success due to the lack of interest from public computer terminal suppliers.
653	Assistive Technology for visual impairment Many people with serious visual impairments live independently, using a wide range of tools and techniques.
653	Examples of Assistive Technology for visually impairment include the Canadian currency tactile feature, which a system of raised dots in one corner, based on Braille cells but not standard Braille.
653	For general computer use access technology such as screen readers, screen magnifiers and refreshable Braille displays has been widely taken up along with  standalone reading aids that integrate a scanner, optical character recognition (OCR) software, and speech software in a single machine.
653	These function together without a separate PC.
653	Augmentative and alternative communication Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) is an umbrella term that encompasses methods of communication for those with impairments or restrictions on the production or comprehension of spoken or written language.
653	AAC systems are extremely diverse and depend on the capabilities of the user.
653	They may be as basic as pictures on a board that the are used to request food, drink, or other care; or they can be advanced speech generating devices, based on speech synthesis, that are capable of storing hundreds of phrases and words.
653	Assistive Technology for Cognition Assistive Technology for Cognition (ATC) is the use of technology (usually high tech) to augment and assistive cognitive4, 5-39.
653	Systematic reviews of the field have found that the number of ATC are growing rapidly, but have focused on memory and planning, that there is emerging evidence for efficacy, that a lot of scope exists to develop new ATC.
653	Examples of ATC include: NeuroPage which prompt users about meetings, Wakamaru, which  provides companionship and reminds users to take medicine and calls for help if something is wrong, and telephone Reassurance systems.
653	Prosthesis A prosthesis, prosthetic, or prosthetic limb  is a device that replaces a missing body part.
653	It is part of the field of biomechatronics, the science of using mechanical devices with human muscle, skeleton, and nervous systems to assist or enhance motor control lost by trauma, disease, or defect.
653	Prostheses are typically used to replace parts lost by injury (traumatic) or missing from birth (congenital) or to supplement defective body parts.
653	Inside the body, artificial heart valves are in common use with artificial hearts and lungs seeing less common use but under active technology development.
653	Other medical devices and aids that can be considered prosthetics include hearing aids, artificial eyes, palatal obturator, gastric bands, and dentures.
653	Prosthetics are specifically not orthotics, although given certain circumstances a prosthetic might end up performing some or all of the same functionary benefits as an orthotic.
653	Prostheses are technically the complete finished item.
653	For instance, a C-Leg knee alone is not a prosthesis, but only a prosthetic part.
653	The complete prosthesis would consist of the stump attachment system — usually a "socket", and all the attachment hardware parts all the way down to and including the foot.
653	Keep this in mind as nomenclature is often interchanged.
653	Assistive Technology and sports Assistive Technology and sports is an area of technology design that is growing.
653	Assistive Technology is the array of new devices created to  enable sports enthusiasts who have disabilities to play.
653	Assistive Technology may be used in adaptive sports, where an existing sport is modified to enable players with a disability to participate; or, Assistive Technology may be used to invent completely new sports with athletes with disabilities exclusively in mind.
653	An increasing number of people with disabilities are participating in sports, leading to the development of new Assistive Technology.
653	Assistive Technology devices can be simple, or "low-tech", or they may use highly advanced technology, with some even using computers.
653	Assistive technology for sports may also be simple, or advanced.
653	Accordingly, Assistive Technology can be found in sports ranging from local community recreation to elite Paralympic games.
653	More complex Assistive Technology devices have been developed over time, and as a result, sports for people with disabilities "have changed from being a clinical therapeutic tool to an increasingly competition-oriented activity".
653	Computer accessibility One of the largest problems that affect patients with disabilities is discomfort with prosthesis.
653	A new computer program is used to create the most comfortable and useful prosthetics.
653	An experiment performed in Massachusetts utilized 20 patients with various sensors attached to their arms.
653	The patients tried different arm exercises, and the sensors recorded their movements.
653	All of the data helped engineers develop new engineering concepts that for prosthetics.
653	Alternatively, Assistive Technology may attempt to improve the ergonomics of the devices themselves such as  Dvorak and other alternative layouts, which offer more ergonomic layouts of the keys.
655	The abacus (plural abaci or abacuses), also called a counting frame, is a calculating tool used primarily in parts of Asia for performing arithmetic processes.
655	Today, abaci are often constructed as a bamboo frame with beads sliding on wires, but originally they were beans or stones moved in grooves in sand or on tablets of wood, stone, or metal.
655	The abacus was in use centuries before the adoption of the written modern numeral system and is still widely used by merchants, traders and clerks in Asia, Africa, and elsewhere.
655	The user of an abacus is called an abacist.
655	Etymology The use of the word abacus dates before 1387 AD, when a Middle English work borrowed the word from Latin to describe a sandboard abacus.
655	The Latin word came from Greek ἄβαξ abax "board strewn with sand or dust used for drawing geometric figures or calculating" (the exact shape of the Latin perhaps reflects the genitive form of the Greek word, ἄβακoς abakos).
655	Greek ἄβαξ itself is probably a borrowing of a Northwest Semitic, perhaps Phoenician, word akin to Hebrew ʾābāq (אבק), "dust" (since dust strewn on wooden boards to draw figures in).
655	The preferred plural of abacus is a subject of disagreement, with both abacuses and abaci in use.
655	Examples Mesopotamian The period 2700–2300 BC saw the first appearance of the Sumerian abacus, a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their sexagesimal number system.
655	Some scholars point to a character from the Babylonian cuneiform which may have been derived from a representation of the abacus.
655	It is the belief of Old Babylonian scholars such as Carruccio that Old Babylonians "may have used the abacus for the operations of addition and subtraction; however, this primitive device proved difficult to use for more complex calculations".
655	Egyptian The use of the abacus in Ancient Egypt is mentioned by the Greek historian Herodotus, who writes that the Egyptians manipulated the pebbles from right to left, opposite in direction to the Greek left-to-right method.
655	Archaeologists have found ancient disks of various sizes that are thought to have been used as counters.
655	However, wall depictions of this instrument have not been discovered, casting some doubt over the extent to which this instrument was used.
655	Persian During the Achaemenid Persian Empire, around 600 BC the Persians first began to use the abacus.
655	Under Parthian and Sassanian Iranian empires, scholars concentrated on exchanging knowledge and inventions by the countries around them – India, China, and the Roman Empire, when it is thought to be expanded over the other countries.
655	Greek The earliest archaeological evidence for the use of the Greek abacus dates to the 5th century BC.
655	The Greek abacus was a table of wood or marble, pre-set with small counters in wood or metal for mathematical calculations.
655	This Greek abacus saw use in Achaemenid Persia, the Etruscan civilization, Ancient Rome and, until the French Revolution, the Western Christian world.
655	A tablet found on the Greek island Salamis in 1846 AD (the Salamis Tablet), dates back to 300 BC, making it the oldest counting board discovered so far.
655	It is a slab of white marble 149 cm long, 75 cm wide, and  thick, on which are 5 groups of markings.
655	In the center of the tablet is a set of 5 parallel lines equally divided by a vertical line, capped with a semicircle at the intersection of the bottom-most horizontal line and the single vertical line.
655	Below these lines is a wide space with a horizontal crack dividing it.
655	Below this crack is another group of eleven parallel lines, again divided into two sections by a line perpendicular to them, but with the semicircle at the top of the intersection; the third, sixth and ninth of these lines are marked with a cross where they intersect with the vertical line.
655	Roman The normal method of calculation in ancient Rome, as in Greece, was by moving counters on a smooth table.
655	Originally pebbles (calculi) were used.
655	Later, and in medieval Europe, jetons were manufactured.
655	Marked lines indicated units, fives, tens etc.
655	Roman numeral system.
655	This system of 'counter casting' continued into the late Roman empire and in medieval Europe, and persisted in limited use into the nineteenth century.
655	Due to Pope Sylvester II's reintroduction of the abacus with very useful modifications, it became widely used in Europe once again during the 11th century Writing in the 1st century BC, Horace refers to the wax abacus, a board covered with a thin layer of black wax on which columns and figures were inscribed using a stylus.
655	One example of archaeological evidence of the Roman abacus, shown here in reconstruction, dates to the 1st century AD.
655	It has eight long grooves containing up to five beads in each and eight shorter grooves having either one or no beads in each.
655	The groove marked I indicates units, X tens, and so on up to millions.
655	The beads in the shorter grooves denote fives –five units, five tens etc., essentially in a bi-quinary coded decimal system, obviously related to the Roman numerals.
655	The short grooves on the right may have been used for marking Roman ounces.
655	Chinese The earliest known written documentation of the Chinese abacus dates to the 2nd century BC.
655	The Chinese abacus, known as the suànpán (算盤, lit.
655	"Counting tray"), is typically 20 cm tall and comes in various widths depending on the operator.
655	It usually has more than seven rods.
655	There are two beads on each rod in the upper deck and five beads each in the bottom for both decimal and hexadecimal computation.
655	The beads are usually rounded and made of a hardwood.
655	The beads are counted by moving them up or down towards the beam.
655	If you move them toward the beam, you count their value.
655	If you move away, you don't count their value.
655	The suanpan can be reset to the starting position instantly by a quick jerk along the horizontal axis to spin all the beads away from the horizontal beam at the center.
655	Suanpans can be used for functions other than counting.
655	Unlike the simple counting board used in elementary schools, very efficient suanpan techniques have been developed to do multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, square root and cube root operations at high speed.
655	There are currently schools teaching students how to use it.
655	In the famous long scroll Along the River During the Qingming Festival painted by Zhang Zeduan (1085–1145 AD) during the Song Dynasty (960–1297 AD), a suanpan is clearly seen lying beside an account book and doctor's prescriptions on the counter of an apothecary's (Feibao).
655	The similarity of the Roman abacus to the Chinese one suggests that one could have inspired the other, as there is some evidence of a trade relationship between the Roman Empire and China.
655	However, no direct connection can be demonstrated, and the similarity of the abaci may be coincidental, both ultimately arising from counting with five fingers per hand.
655	Where the Roman model (like most modern Japanese) has 4 plus 1 bead per decimal place, the standard suanpan has 5 plus 2, allowing use with a hexadecimal numeral system.
655	Instead of running on wires as in the Chinese and Japanese models, the beads of Roman model run in grooves, presumably making arithmetic calculations much slower.
655	Another possible source of the suanpan is Chinese counting rods, which operated with a decimal system but lacked the concept of zero as a place holder.
655	The zero was probably introduced to the Chinese in the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD) when travel in the Indian Ocean and the Middle East would have provided direct contact with India, allowing them to acquire the concept of zero and the decimal point from Indian merchants and mathematicians.
655	Indian First century sources, such as the Abhidharmakosa describe the knowledge and use of abacus in India.
655	Around the 5th century, Indian clerks were already finding new wayns|Langer|2001|p=44}}&lts of recording the contents of the Abacus.
655	Hindu texts used the term shunya (zero) to indicate the empty column on the abacus.
655	Japanese In Japanese, the abacus is called soroban (, lit.
655	"Counting tray"), imported from China around 1600.
655	The 1/4 abacus, which is suited to decimal calculation, appeared circa 1930, and became widespread as the Japanese abandoned hexadecimal weight calculation which was still common in China.
655	The abacus is still manufactured in Japan today even with the proliferation, practicality, and affordability of pocket electronic calculators.
655	The use of the soroban is still taught in Japanese primary schools as part of mathematics, primarily as an aid to faster mental calculation.
655	Using visual imagery of a soroban, one can arrive at the answer in the same time as, or even faster than, is possible with a physical instrument.
655	Korean The Chinese abacus migrated from China to Korea around 1400 AD.
655	Koreans call it jupan (주판), supan (수판) or jusan (주산).
655	Native American Some sources mention the use of an abacus called a nepohualtzintzin in ancient Mayan culture.
655	This Mesoamerican abacus used a 5-digit base-20 system.
655	The word Nepōhualtzintzin comes from the Nahuatl and it is formed by the roots; Ne - personal -; pōhual or pōhualli - the account -; and tzintzin - small similar elements.
655	And its complete meaning was taken as: counting with small similar elements by somebody.
655	Its use was taught in the Calmecac to the temalpouhqueh, who were students dedicated to take the accounts of skies, from childhood.
655	Unfortunately the Nepōhualtzintzin and its teaching were among the victims of the conquering destruction, when a diabolic origin was attributed to them after observing the tremendous properties of representation, precision and speed of calculations.
655	This arithmetic tool was based on the vigesimal system (base 20).
655	For the Aztec the count by 20s was completely natural.
655	The amount of 4, 5, 13, 20 and other cyclees meant cycles.
655	The Nepōhualtzintzin was divided in two main parts separated by a bar or intermediate cord.
655	In the left part there were four beads, which in the first row have unitary values (1, 2, 3, and 4), and in the right side there are three beads with values of 5, 10, and 15 respectively.
655	In order to know the value of the respective beads of the upper rows, it is enough to multiply by 20 (by each row), the value of the corresponding account in the first row.
655	Altogether, there were 13 rows with 7 beads in each one, which made up 91 beads in each Nepōhualtzintzin.
655	This was a basic number to understand, 7 times 13, a close relation conceived between natural phenomena, the underworld and the cycles of the heavens.
655	One Nepōhualtzintzin (91) represented the number of days that a season of the year lasts, two Nepōhualtzitzin (182) is the number of days of the corn's cycle, from its sowing to its harvest, three Nepōhualtzintzin (273) is the number of days of a baby's gestation, and four Nepōhualtzintzin (364) completed a cycle and approximate a year (1 days short).
655	The Nepōhualtzintzin amounted to the rank from 10 to the 18 in floating point, which calculated stellar as well as infinitesimal amounts with absolute precision, meant that no round off was allowed, when translated into modern computer arithmetic.
655	The rediscovery of the Nepōhualtzintzin was due to the Mexican engineer David Esparza Hidalgo, who in his wanderings throughout Mexico found diverse engravings and paintings of this instrument and reconstructed several of them made in gold, jade, encrustations of shell, etc.
655	There have also been found very old Nepōhualtzintzin attributed to the Olmeca culture, and even some bracelets of Mayan origin, as well as a diversity of forms and materials in other cultures.
655	George I.
655	Sanchez, "Arithmetic in Maya", Austin-Texas, 1961 found another base 5, base 4 abacus in the Yucatán that also computed calendar data.
655	This was a finger abacus, on one hand 0 1,2, 3, and 4 were used; and on the other hand used 0, 1, 2 and 3 were used.
655	Note the use of zero at the beginning and end of the two cycles.
655	Sanchez worked with Sylvanus Morley, a noted Mayanist.
655	The quipu of the Incas was a system of knotted cords used to record numerical data, like advanced tally sticks – but not used to perform calculations.
655	Calculations were carried out using a yupana (Quechua for "counting tool"; see figure) which was still in use after the conquest of Peru.
655	The working principle of a yupana is unknown, but in 2001 an explanation of the mathematical basis of these instruments was proposed by Italian mathematician Nicolino De Pasquale.
655	By comparing the form of several yupanas, researchers found that calculations were based using the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and powers of 10, 20 and 40 as place values for the different fields in the instrument.
655	Using the Fibonacci sequence would keep the number of grains within any one field at minimum.
655	Russian The Russian abacus, the schoty (счёты), usually has a single slanted deck, with ten beads on each wire (except one wire, usually positioned near the user, with four beads for quarter-ruble fractions).
655	Older models have another 4-bead wire for quarter-kopeks, which were minted until 1916.
655	The Russian abacus is often used vertically, with wires from left to right in the manner of a book.
655	The wires are usually bowed to bulge upward in the center, to keep the beads pinned to either of the two sides.
655	It is cleared when all the beads are moved to the right.
655	During manipulation, beads are moved to the left.
655	For easy viewing, the middle 2 beads on each wire (the 5th and 6th bead) usually are of a different colour from the other eight beads.
655	Likewise, the left bead of the thousands wire (and the million wire, if present) may have a different color.
655	As a simple, cheap e thousands wire (and the million wire, if present) may have a different coloand reliable device, the Russian abacus was in use in all shops and markets throughout the former Soviet Union, and the usage of it was taught in most schools until the 1990s.
655	Even the 1874 invention of mechanical calculator, Odhner arithmometer, had not replaced them in Russia and likewise the mass production of Felix arithmometers since 1924 did not significantly reduce their use in the Soviet Union.
655	Russian abacus began to lose popularity only after the mass production of microcalculators had started in the Soviet Union in 1974.
655	Today it is regarded as an archaism and replaced by the handheld calculator.
655	The Russian abacus was brought to France around 1820 by the mathematician Jean-Victor Poncelet, who served in Napoleon's army and had been a prisoner of war in Russia.
655	The abacus had fallen out of use in western Europe in the 16th century with the rise of decimal notation and algorismic methods.
655	To Poncelet's French contemporaries, it was something new.
655	Poncelet used it, not for any applied purpose, but as a teaching and demonstration aid.
655	School abacus Around the world, abaci have been used in pre-schools and elementary schools as an aid in teaching the numeral system and arithmetic.
655	In Western countries, a bead frame similar to the Russian abacus but with straight wires and a vertical frame has been common (see image).
655	It is still often seen as a plastic or wooden toy.
655	The type of abacus shown here is often used to represent numbers without the use of place value.
655	Each bead and each wire has the same value and used in this way it can represent numbers up to 100.
655	Renaissance abaci gallery Uses by the blind An adapted abacus, invented by Tim Cranmer, called a Cranmer abacus is still commonly used by individuals who are blind.
655	A piece of soft fabric or rubber is placed behind the beads so that they do not move inadvertently.
655	This keeps the beads in place while the users feel or manipulate them.
655	They use an abacus to perform the mathematical functions multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, square root and cubic root.
655	Although blind students have benefited from talking calculators, the abacus is still very often taught to these students in early grades, both in public schools and state schools for the blind.
655	The abacus teaches mathematical skills that can never be replaced with talking calculators and is an important learning tool for blind students.
655	Blind students also complete mathematical assignments using a braille-writer and Nemeth code (a type of braille code for mathematics) but large multiplication and long division problems can be long and difficult.
655	The abacus gives blind and visually impaired students a tool to compute mathematical problems that equals the speed and mathematical knowledge required by their sighted peers using pencil and paper.
655	Many blind people find this number machine a very useful tool throughout life.
655	Binary abacus The binary abacus is used to explain how computers manipulate numbers.
655	The abacus shows how numbers, letters, and signs can be stored in a binary system on a computer, or via ASCII.
655	The device consists of a series of beads on parallel wires arranged in three separate rows.
655	The beads represent a switch on the computer in either an 'on' or 'off' position.
656	An acid (from the Latin acidus/acēre meaning sour) is a substance which reacts with a base.
656	Commonly, acids can be identified as tasting sour, reacting with metals such as calcium, and bases like sodium carbonate.
656	Aqueous acids have a pH under 7, with acidity increasing the lower the pH.
656	Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic.
656	Common examples of acids include acetic acid (in vinegar), sulfuric acid (used in car batteries), hydrochloric acid (used in the stomach for enzymes) and tartaric acid (used in baking).
656	As these three examples show, acids can be solutions, liquids, or solids.
656	Gases such as hydrogen chloride can be acids as well when dissolved in water.
656	Strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive, but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid.
656	There are three common definitions for acids: the Arrhenius definition, the Brønsted-Lowry definition, and the Lewis definition.
656	The Arrhenius definition states that acids are substances which increase the concentration of hydronium ions (H3O+) in solution.
656	The Brønsted-Lowry definition is an expansion: an acid is a substance which can act as a proton donor.
656	Most acids encountered in everyday life are aqueous solutions, or can be dissolved in water, and these two definitions are most relevant.
656	The reason why pHs of acids are less than 7 is that the concentration of hydronium ions is greater than 10−7 moles per liter.
656	Since pH is defined as the negative logarithm of the concentration of hydronium ions, acids thus have pHs of less than 7.
656	By the Brønsted-Lowry definition, any compound which can easily be deprotonated can be considered an acid.
656	Examples include alcohols and amines which contain O-H or N-H fragments.
656	In chemistry, the Lewis definition of acidity is frequently encountered.
656	Lewis acids are electron-pair acceptors.
656	Examples of Lewis acids include all metal cations, and electron-deficient molecules such as boron trifluoride and aluminium trichloride.
656	Hydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions.
656	Interestingly, although alcohols and amines can be Brønsted-Lowry acids as mentioned above, they can also function as Lewis bases due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms.
656	Definitions and concepts Modern definitions are concerned with the fundamental chemical reactions common to all acids.
656	Arrhenius acids The Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius attributed the properties of acidity to hydrogen ions (H+) or protons in 1884.
656	An Arrhenius acid is a substance that, when added to water, increases the concentration of H+ ions in the water.
656	Note that chemists often write H+(aq) and refer to the hydrogen ion when describing acid-base reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus, a proton, does not exist alone in water, it exists as the hydronium ion, H3O+.
656	Thus, an Arrhenius acid can also be described as a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ions when added to water.
656	This definition stems from the equilibrium dissociation of water into hydronium and hydroxide (OH−) ions: H2O(l) + H2O(l)  H3O+(aq) + OH−(aq) In pure water the majority of molecules exist as H2O, but a small number of molecules are constantly dissociating and re-associating.
656	Pure water is neutral with respect to acidity or basicity because the concentration of hydroxide ions is always equal to the concentration of hydronium ions.
656	An Arrhenius base, on the other hand, is a molecule which increases the concentration of the hydroxide ion when dissolved in water.
656	Brønsted-Lowry acids While the Arrhenius concept is useful for describing many reactions, it is also quite limited in its scope.
656	In 1923 chemists Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted and Thomas Martin Lowry independently recognized that acid-base reactions involve the transfer of a proton.
656	A Brønsted-Lowry acid (or simply Brønsted acid) is a species that donates a proton to a Brønsted-Lowry base.
656	Brønsted-Lowry acid-base theory has several advantages over Arrhenius theory.
656	Consider the following reactions of acetic acid (CH3COOH), the organic acid that gives vinegar its characteristic taste (seen in the image to the right): +    +  Both theories easily describe the first reaction: CH3COOH acts as an Arrhenius acid because it acts as a source of H3O+ when dissolved in water, and it acts as a Brønsted acid by donating a proton to water.
656	In the second example CH3COOH undergoes the same transformation, in this case donating a proton to ammonia (NH3), but cannot be described using the Arrhenius definition of an acid because the reaction does not produce hydronium.
656	Brønsted-Lowry theory can also be used to describe molecular compounds, whereas Arrhenius acids must be ionic compounds.
656	Hydrogen chloride (HCl) and ammonia combine under several different conditions to form ammonium chloride, NH4Cl.
656	In aqueous solution HCl behaves as hydrochloric acid and exists as hydronium and chloride ions.
656	The following reactions illustrate the limitations of Arrhenius's definition: # H3O+(aq) + Cl−(aq) + NH3 → Cl−(aq) + NH4+(aq) + H2O # HCl(benzene) + NH3(benzene) → NH4Cl(s) # HCl(g) + NH3(g) → NH4Cl(s) As with the acetic acid reactions, both definitions work for the first example, where water is the solvent and hydronium ion is formed by the HCl solute.
656	The next two reactions do not involve the formation of ions but are still proton transfer reactions.
656	In the second reaction hydrogen chloride and ammonia (dissolved in benzene) react to form solid ammonium chloride in a benzene solvent and in the third gaseous HCl and NH3 combine to form the solid.
656	Lewis acids A third concept was proposed in 1923 by Gilbert N.
656	Lewis which includes reactions with acid-base characteristics that do not involve a proton transfer.
656	A Lewis acid is a species that accepts a pair of electrons from another species; in other words, it is an electron pair acceptor.
656	Brønsted acid-base reactions are proton transfer reactions while Lewis acid-base reactions are electron pair transfers.
656	All Brønsted acids are also Lewis acids, but not all Lewis acids are Brønsted acids.
656	Contrast the following reactions which could be described in terms of acid-base chemistry.
656	In the first reaction a fluoride ion, F−, gives up an electron pair to boron trifluoride to form the product tetrafluoroborate.
656	Fluoride "loses" a pair of valence electrons because the electrons shared in the B—F bond are located in the region of space between the two atomic nuclei and are therefore more distant from the fluoride nucleus than they are in the lone fluoride ion.
656	BF3 is a Lewis acid because it accepts the electron pair from fluoride.
656	This reaction cannot be described in terms of Brønsted theory because there is no proton transfer.
656	The second reaction can be described using either theory.
656	A proton is transferred from an unspecified Brønsted acid to ammonia, a Brønsted base; alternatively, ammonia acts as a Lewis base and transfers a lone pair of electrons to form a bond with a hydrogen ion.
656	The species that gains the electron pair is the Lewis acid; for example, the oxygen atom in H3O+ gains a pair of electrons when one of the H—O bonds is broken and the electrons shared in the bond become localized on oxygen.
656	Depending on the context, a Lewis acid may also be described as an oxidizer or an electrophile.
656	The Brønsted-Lowry definition is the most widely used definition; unless otherwise specified acid-base reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of a proton (H+) from an acid to a base.
656	Dissociation and equilibrium Reactions of acids are often generalized in the form HA  H+ + A−, where HA represents the acid and A− is the conjugate base.
656	Acid-base conjugate pairs differ by one proton, and can be interconverted by the addition or removal of a proton (protonation and deprotonation, respectively).
656	Note that the acid can be the charged species and the conjugate base can be neutral in which case the generalized reaction scheme could be written as HA+  H+ + A.
656	In solution there exists an equilibrium between the acid and its conjugate base.
656	The equilibrium constant K is an expression of the equilibrium concentrations of the molecules or the ions in solution.
656	Brackets indicate concentration, such that [H2O] means the concentration of H2O.
656	The acid dissociation constant Ka is generally used in the context of acid-base reactions.
656	The numerical value of Ka is equal to the concentration of the products divided by the concentration of the reactants, where the reactant is the acid (HA) and the products are the conjugate base and H+.
656	The stronger of two acids will have a higher Ka than the weaker acid; the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton.
656	Because the range of possible values for Ka spans many orders of magnitude, a more manageable constant, pKa is more frequently used, where pKa = -log10 Ka.
656	Stronger acids have a smaller pKa than weaker acids.
656	Experimentally determined pKa at 25 °C in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material.
656	Nomenclature In the classical naming system, acids are named according to their anions.
656	That ionic suffix is dropped and replaced with a new suffix (and sometimes prefix), according to the table below.
656	For example, HCl has chloride as its anion, so the -ide suffix makes it take the form hydrochloric acid.
656	In the IUPAC naming system, "aqueous" is simply added to the name of the ionic compound.
656	Thus, for hydrogen chloride, the IUPAC name would be aqueous hydrogen chloride.
656	The prefc compound.
656	Thus, for hydrogen chloride, the ix "hydro-" is added only if the acid is made up of just hydrogen and one other element.
656	Classical naming system: Acid strength The strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton.
656	A strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water; in other words, one mole of a strong acid HA dissolves in water yielding one mole of H+ and one mole of the conjugate base, A−, and none of the protonated acid HA.
656	In contrast a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution.
656	Examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydroiodic acid (HI), hydrobromic acid (HBr), perchloric acid (HClO4), nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).
656	In water each of these essentially ionizes 100%.
656	The stronger an acid is, the more easily it loses a proton, H+.
656	Two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the polarity of the H—A bond and the size of atom A, which determines the strength of the H—A bond.
656	Acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base.
656	Stronger acids have a larger Ka and a more negative pKa than weaker acids.
656	Sulfonic acids, which are organic oxyacids, are a class of strong acids.
656	A common example is toluenesulfonic acid (tosylic acid).
656	Unlike sulfuric acid itself, sulfonic acids can be solids.
656	In fact, polystyrene functionalized into polystyrene sulfonate is a solid strongly acidic plastic that is filterable.
656	Superacids are acids stronger than 100% sulfuric acid.
656	Examples of superacids are fluoroantimonic acid, magic acid and perchloric acid.
656	Superacids can permanently protonate water to give ionic, crystalline hydronium "salts".
656	They can also quantitatively stabilize carbocations.
656	Chemical characteristics Monoprotic acids Monoprotic acids are those acids that are able to donate one proton per molecule during the process of dissociation (sometimes called ionization) as shown below (symbolized by HA): ::::HA(aq) + H2O(l)  H3O+(aq) + A−(aq)         Ka Common examples of monoprotic acids in mineral acids include hydrochloric acid (HCl) and nitric acid (HNO3).
656	On the other hand, for organic acids the term mainly indicates the presence of one carboxylic acid group and sometimes these acids are known as monocarboxylic acid.
656	Examples in organic acids include formic acid (HCOOH), acetic acid (CH3COOH) and benzoic acid (C6H5COOH).
656	Polyprotic acids Polyprotic acids, also known as polybasic acids, are able to donate more than one proton per acid molecule, in contrast to monoprotic acids that only donate one proton per molecule.
656	Specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names, such as diprotic acid (two potential protons to donate) and triprotic acid (three potential protons to donate).
656	A diprotic acid (here symbolized by H2A) can undergo one or two dissociations depending on the pH.
656	Each dissociation has its own dissociation constant, Ka1 and Ka2.
656	H2A(aq) + H2O(l)  H3O+(aq) + HA−(aq)       Ka1 ::::HA−(aq) + H2O(l)  H3O+(aq) + A2−(aq)       Ka2 The first dissociation constant is typically greater than the second; i.e., Ka1 > Ka2.
656	For example, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) can donate one proton to form the bisulfate anion (HSO4−), for which Ka1 is very large; then it can donate a second proton to form the sulfate anion (SO42-), wherein the Ka2 is intermediate strength.
656	The large Ka1 for the first dissociation makes sulfuric a strong acid.
656	In a similar manner, the weak unstable carbonic acid (H2CO3) can lose one proton to form bicarbonate anion (HCO3−) and lose a second to form carbonate anion (CO32-).
656	Both Ka values are small, but Ka1 > Ka2 .
656	A triprotic acid (H3A) can undergo one, two, or three dissociations and has three dissociation constants, where Ka1 > Ka2 > Ka3.
656	H3A(aq) + H2O(l)  H3O+(aq) + H2A−(aq)        Ka1 ::::H2A−(aq) + H2O(l)  H3O+(aq) + HA2−(aq)       Ka2 ::::HA2−(aq) + H2O(l)  H3O+(aq) + A3−(aq)         Ka3 An inorganic example of a triprotic acid is orthophosphoric acid (H3PO4), usually just called phosphoric acid.
656	All three protons can be successively lost to yield H2PO4−, then HPO42-, and finally PO43-, the orthophosphate ion, usually just called phosphate.
656	An organic example of a triprotic acid is citric acid, which can successively lose three protons to finally form the citrate ion.
656	Even though the positions of the protons on the original molecule may be equivalent, the successive Ka values will differ since it is energetically less favorable to lose a proton if the conjugate base is more negatively charged.
656	Although the subsequent loss of each hydrogen ion is less favorable, all of the conjugate bases are present in solution.
656	The fractional concentration, α (alpha), for each species can be calculated.
656	For example, a generic diprotic acid will generate 3 species in solution: pecies can be calculated.
656	For example, H2A, HA-, and A2-.
656	The fractional concentrations can be calculated as below when given either the pH (which can be converted to the [H+]) or the concentrations of the acid with all its conjugate bases: A plot of these fractional concentrations against pH, for given K1 and K2, is known as a Bjerrum plot.
656	A pattern is observed in the above equations and can be expanded to the general n -protic acid that has been deprotonated i -times: \alpha_{H_{n-i} A^{i-} }=
657	Asphalt or or, also known as bitumen, is a sticky, black and highly viscous liquid or semi-solid form of petroleum.
657	It may be found in natural deposits or may be a refined product; it is a substance classed as a pitch.
657	Until the 20th century, the term asphaltum was also used.
657	The primary use of asphalt/bitumen is in road construction, where it is used as the glue or binder mixed with aggregate particles to create asphalt concrete.
657	Its other main uses are for bituminous waterproofing products, including production of roofing felt and for sealing flat roofs.
657	The terms asphalt and bitumen are often used interchangeably to mean both natural and manufactured forms of the substance.
657	In American English, asphalt (or asphalt cement) is the carefully refined residue from the distillation process of selected crude oils.
657	Outside the United States, the product is often called bitumen.
657	Geological terminology often prefers the term bitumen.
657	Common usage often refers to various forms of asphalt/bitumen as "tar", such as at the La Brea Tar Pits.
657	Another term, mostly archaic, refers to asphalt/bitumen as "pitch".
657	The pitch used in this mixture is sometimes found in natural deposits but usually made by the distillation of crude oil.
657	Naturally occurring asphalt/bitumen is sometimes specified by the term "crude bitumen".
657	Its viscosity is similar to that of cold molasses while the material obtained from the fractional distillation of crude oil [boiling at 525 C] is sometimes referred to as "refined bitumen".
657	Etymology The word asphalt is derived from the late Middle English, in turn from French asphalte, based on Late Latin asphalton, asphaltum, which is the latinisation of the Greek ἄσφαλτος (ásphaltos, ásphalton), a word meaning "asphalt/bitumen/pitch", which perhaps derives from α- "without" and σφάλλω, (sfallō), "make fall".
657	Note that in French, the term asphalte is used for naturally occurring bitumen-soaked limestone deposits, and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater bitumen content than the "asphaltic concrete" used to pave roads.
657	It is a significant fact that the first use of asphalt by the ancients was in the nature of a cement for securing or joining together various objects, and it thus seems likely that the name itself was expressive of this application.
657	Specifically Herodotus mentioned that bitumen was brought to Babylon to build its gigantic fortification wall.
657	From the Greek, the word passed into late Latin, and thence into French (asphalte) and English ("asphaltum" and "asphalt").
657	The expression "bitumen" originated in the Sanskrit, where we find the words jatu, meaning "pitch," and jatu-krit, meaning "pitch creating", "pitch producing" (referring to coniferous or resinous trees).
657	The Latin equivalent is claimed by some to be originally gwitu-men (pertaining to pitch), and by others, pixtumens (exuding or bubbling pitch), which was subsequently shortened to bitumen, thence passing via French into English.
657	From the same root is derived the Anglo Saxon word cwidu (mastix), the German word Kitt (cement or mastic) and the old Norse word kvada.
657	Neither of the terms asphalt or bitumen should be confused with tar or coal tars.
657	Modern usage  In British English, the word 'asphalt' is used to refer to a mixture of mineral aggregate and asphalt/bitumen (also called tarmac in common parlance).
657	The earlier word 'asphaltum' is now archaic and not commonly used.
657	In American English, 'asphalt' is equivalent to the British 'bitumen'.
657	However, 'asphalt' is also commonly used as a shortened form of 'asphalt concrete' (therefore equivalent to the British 'asphalt' or 'tarmac').
657	In Australian English, bitumen is often used as the generic term for road surfaces.
657	In Canadian English, the word bitumen is used to refer to the vast Canadian deposits of extremely heavy crude oil, while asphalt is used for the oil refinery product used to pave roads and manufacture roof shingles and various waterproofing products.
657	Diluted bitumen (diluted with naphtha to make it flow in pipelines) is known as dilbit in the Canadian petroleum industry, while bitumen "upgraded" to synthetic crude oil is known as syncrude and syncrude blended with bitumen as synbit.
657	Bitumen is still the preferred geological term for naturally occurring deposits of the solid or semi-solid form of petroleum.
657	Bituminous rock is a form of sandstone impregnated with bitumen.
657	The oil sands of Alberta, Canada are a similar material.
657	Chemistry The substance is completely soluble in carbon disulfide, and composed primarily of a mixture of highly condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; it is most commonly modelled as a colloid, with asphaltenes as the dispersed phase and [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/maltene maltenes] as the continuous phase (though there is some disagreement amongst chemists regarding its structure).
657	One writer stated although a "considerable amount of work has been done on the composition of asphalt, it is exceedingly difficult to separate individual hydrocarbon in pure form", and "it is almost impossible to separate and identify all the different molecules of asphalt, because the number of molecules with different chemical structure is extremely large".
657	Most natural bitumens contain sulfur and several heavy metals, such as nickel, vanadium, lead, chromium, mercury, arsenic, selenium, and other toxic elements.
657	Bitumens can provide good preservation of plants and animal fossils.
657	Asphalt/bitumen can sometimes be confused with "tar", which is a similar black, thermoplastic material produced by the destructive distillation of coal.
657	During the early  and mid-20th century when town gas was produced, tar was a readily available product and extensively used as the binder for road aggregates.
657	The addition of tar to macadam roads led to the word tarmac, which is now used in common parlance to refer to road-making materials.
657	However, since the 1970s, when natural gas succeeded town gas, asphalt/bitumen has completely overtaken the use of tar in these applications.
657	Other examples of this confusion include the La Brea Tar Pits and the Canadian tar sands.
657	Pitch is another term mistakenly used at times to refer to asphalt/bitumen, as in Pitch Lake.
657	Natural deposits of asphalt/bitumen include lakes such as the Pitch Lake in Trinidad and Tobago and Lake Bermudez in Venezuela, Gilsonite, the Dead Sea, asphalt/bitumen-impregnated sandstones known as bituminous rock and the similar "tar sands".
657	Asphalt/bitumen was mined at Ritchie Mines in Macfarlan in Ritchie County, West Virginia in the United States from 1852 to 1873.
657	Bituminous rock was mined at many locations in the United States for use as a paving material, primarily during the late 1800s.
657	Asphalt/bitumen can be separated from the other components in crude oil (such as naphtha, gasoline and diesel) by the process of fractional distillation, usually under vacuum conditions.
657	A better separation can be achieved by further processing of the heavier fractions of the crude oil in a de-asphalting unit, which uses either propane or butane in a supercritical phase to dissolve the lighter molecules which are then separated.
657	Further processing is possible by "blowing" the product: namely reacting it with oxygen.
657	This makes the product harder and more viscous.
657	Asphalt/bitumen is typically stored and transported at temperatures around 150°C (300°F).
657	Sometimes diesel oil or kerosene are mixed in before shipping to retain liquidity; upon delivery, these lighter materials are separated out of the mixture.
657	This mixture is often called "bitumen feedstock", or BFS.
657	Some dump trucks route the hot engine exhaust through pipes in the dump body to keep the material warm.
657	The backs of tippers carrying asphalt/bitumen, as well as some handling equipment, are also commonly sprayed with a releasing agent before filling to aid release.
657	Diesel oil is no longer used as a release agent due to environmental concerns.
657	History Geological origin Naturally occurring deposits of asphalt/bitumen are formed from the remains of ancient, microscopic algae (diatoms) and other once-living things.
657	These remains were deposited in the mud on the bottom of the ocean or lake where the organisms lived.
657	Under the heat (above 50 °C) and pressure of burial deep in the earth, the remains were transformed into materials such as asphalt/bitumen, kerogen, or petroleum.
657	Deposits at the La Brea Tar Pits are an example.
657	There are structural similarities between asphalt/bitumen and the organic matter in carbonaceous meteorites.
657	However, detailed studies have shown these materials to be distinct.
657	Ancient times The use of asphalt/bitumen for waterproofing and as an adhesive dates at least to the fifth millennium B.C.
657	Indus community of Mehrgarh, where it was used to line the baskets in which they gathered crops.
657	In the ancient Middle East, the Sumerians used natural asphalt/bitumen deposits for mortar between bricks and stones, to cement parts of carvings, such as eyes, into place, for ship caulking, and for waterproofing.
657	The Greek historian Herodotus said hot asphalt/bitumen was used as mortar in the walls of Babylon.
657	In some versions of the Book of Genesis in the Bible, the name of the substance used to bind the bricks of the Tower of Babel is translated as bitumen (see Gen 11:3), while other translations use the word pitch.
657	A one-kilometre tunnel beneath the river Euphrates at Babylon in the time of Queen Semiramis (ca.
657	B.C.) was reportedly constructed of burnt bricks covered with asphalt/bitumen as a waterproofing agent.
657	Asphalt/bitumen was used by ancient Egyptians to embalm mummies.
657	The Persian word for asphalt is moom, which is related to the English word mummy.
657	The Egyptians' primary source of asphalt/bitumen was the Dead Sea, which the Romans knew as Palus Asphaltites (Asphalt Lake).
657	Approximately 40 AD, Dioscorides described the Dead Sea material as Judaicum bitumen, and noted other places in the region where it could be found:  "The Judaicum Bitumen is better than others; that is reckoned the best, which doth shine like purple;The Judaicum, being of a strong scent & weightie, but the black and fowle is naught for it is adulterated with Pitch mixed with it.
657	It growes in Phoenice also, and in Sidon, & in Babylon, & in Zacynthum.
657	It is found also moyst swimming upon wells in the country of the Agrigentines of Sicilie, which they use for lamps instead of oyle, and which they call falsely Sicilian oyle, for it is a kinde of moyst Bitumen."
657	The Sidon bitumen is thought to refer to asphalt/bitumen found at Hasbeya.
657	Pliny refers also to asphalt/bitumen being found in Epirus.
657	It was a valuable strategic resource; the object of the first known battle for a hydrocarbon deposit, between the Seleucids and the Nabateans in 312 B.C.
657	In the ancient Far East, natural asphalt/bitumen was slowly boiled to get rid of the higher fractions, leaving a material of higher molecular weight which is thermoplastic and when layered on objects, became quite hard upon cooling.
657	This was used to cover objects that needed waterproofing, such as scabbards and other items.
657	Statuettes of household deities were also cast with this type of material in Japan, and probably also in China.
657	In North America, archaeological recovery has indicated asphalt/bitumen was sometimes used to adhere stone projectile points to  wooden shafts.
657	Early use in Europe The Greek fire, which composition was a military secret of the Byzantine navy, contained, among other things, asphalt/bitumen as a component.
657	Constantinople in 1453, Pierre Belon described in his work Observations in 1553 that pissasphalto a mixture of pitch and bitumen was used in Dubrovnik for tarring of ships from where it was exported to a market place in Venice where it could be bought by anyone.
657	An 1838 edition of Mechanics Magazine cites an early use of asphalt in France.
657	A pamphlet dated 1621, by "a certain Monsieur d'Eyrinys, states that he had discovered the existence (of asphaltum) in large quantities in the vicinity of Neufchatel", and that he proposed to use it in a variety of ways - "principally in the construction of air-proof granaries, and in protecting, by means of the arches, the water-courses in the city of Paris from the intrusion of dirt and filth", which at that time made the water unusable.
657	"He expatiates also on the excellence of this material for forming level and durable terraces" in palaces, "the notion of forming such terraces in the streets not one likely to cross the brain of a Parisian of that generation".
657	But it was generally  neglected in France until the revolution of 1830.
657	Then, in the 1830s, there was a surge of interest, and asphalt became widely used "for pavements, flat roofs, and the lining of cisterns, and in England, some use of it had been made of it for similar purposes".
657	Its rise in Europe was "a sudden phenomenon", after natural deposits were found "in France at Osbann (BasRhin), the Parc (l'Ain) and the Puy-de-la-Poix (Puy-de-Dome)", although it could also be made artificially.
657	One of the earliest uses in France was the laying of about 24,000 square yards of Seyssel asphalt at the Place de la Concorde in 1835.
657	Photography and art Asphalt/bitumen was used in early photographic technology.
657	In 1826 or 1827, it was used by French scientist Joseph Nicéphore Niépce to make the oldest surviving photograph from nature.
657	The asphalt/bitumen was thinly coated onto a pewter plate which was then exposed in a camera.
657	Exposure to light hardened the asphalt/bitumen and made it insoluble, so that when it was subsequently rinsed with a solvent only the sufficiently light-struck areas remained.
657	Many hours of exposure in the camera were required, making asphalt/bitumen impractical for ordinary photography, but from the 1850s to the 1920s it was in common use as a photoresist in the production of printing plates for various photomechanical printing processes.
657	Asphalt/bitumen was the nemesis of many artists during the 19th century.
657	Although widely used for a time, it ultimately proved unstable for use in oil painting, especially when mixed with the most common dilutents, such as linseed oil, varnish  and turpentine.
657	Unless thoroughly diluted, asphalt/bitumen never fully solidifies and will in time corrupt the other pigments with which it comes into contact.
657	The use of asphalt/bitumen as a glaze to set in shadow or mixed with other colours to render a darker tone resulted in the eventual deterioration of a good many paintings, those of Delacroix being just one notable example.
657	Perhaps the most famous example of the destructiveness of asphalt/bitumenjust one notable exa is Théodore Géricault's Raft of the Medusa (1818-1819), where his use of asphalt/bitumen caused the brilliant colors to degenerate into dark greens and blacks and the paint and canvas to buckle.
657	Early use in the United Kingdom Among the earlier uses of asphalt/bitumen in the United Kingdom was for etching.
657	William Salmon's Polygraphice (1673) provides a recipe for varnish used in etching, consisting of three ounces of virgin wax, two ounces of mastic, and one ounce of asphaltum.
657	By the fifth edition in 1685, he had included more asphaltum recipes from other sources.
657	The first British patent for the use of asphalt/bitumen was Cassell's patent asphalte or bitumen' in 1834.
657	Then on 25 November 1837, Richard Tappin Claridge patented the use of Seyssel asphalt (patent #7849), for use in asphalte pavement, having seen it employed in France and Belgium when visiting with Frederick Walter Simms, who worked with him on the introduction of asphalt to Britain.
657	Dr T.
657	Lamb Phipson claims that his father, Samuel Ryland Phipson, a friend of Claridge, was also "instrumental in introducing the asphalte pavement (in 1836)".
657	Indeed, mastic pavements had been previously employed at Vauxhall by a competitor of Claridge, but without success.
657	In 1838, Claridge obtained patents in Scotland on 27 March, and Ireland on 23 April, and in 1851 extensions were sought for all three patents, by the trustees of a company previously formed by Claridge.
657	This was Claridge's Patent Asphalte Company, formed in 1838 for the purpose of introducing to Britain "Asphalte in its natural state from the mine at Pyrimont Seysell in France", and "laid one of the first asphalt pavements in Whitehall".
657	Trials were made of the pavement in 1838 on the footway in Whitehall, the stable at Knightsbridge Barracks, "and subsequently on the space at the bottom of the steps leading from Waterloo Place to St.
657	James Park".
657	"The formation in 1838 of Claridge's Patent Asphalte Company (with a distinguished list of aristocratic patrons, and Marc and Isambard Brunel as, respectively, a trustee and consulting engineer), gave an enormous impetus to the development of a British asphalt industry".
657	"By the end of 1838, at least two other companies, Robinson's and the Bastenne company, were in production", with asphalt being laid as paving at les10.06.2">Miles,Brighton, Herne Bay, Canterbury, Kensington, the Strand, and a large floor area in Bunhill-row, while meantime Claridge's Whitehall paving "continue(d) in good order".
657	Indeed in 1838, there was a flurry of entrepreneurial activity over asphalt/bitumen, which had uses beyond paving.
657	For example, asphalt could also used for flooring, damp proofing in buildings, and for waterproofing of various types of pools and baths, with these latter themselves proliferating in the 19th century.
657	On the London stockmarket, there were various claims as to the exclusivity of asphalt quality from France, Germany and England.
657	And numerous patents were granted in France, with similar numbers of patent applications being denied in England due to their similarity to each other.
657	In England, "Claridge's was the type most used in the 1840s and 50s" In 1914, Claridge's Company entered into a joint venture to produce tar-bound macadam, with materials manufactured through a subsidiary company called Clarmac Roads Ltd.
657	Two products resulted, namely Clarmac, and Clarphalte, with the former being manufactured by Clarmac Roads and the latter by Claridge's Patent Asphalte Co., although Clarmac was more widely used.
657	However, the First World War  impacted financially on the Clarmac Company, which entered into liquidation in 1915.
657	The failure of Clarmac Roads Ltd had a flow-on effect to Claridge's Company, which was itself compulsorily wound up, ceasing operations in 1917, having invested a substantial amount of funds into the new venture, both at the outset, and in a subsequent attempt to save the Clarmac Company.
657	Early use in the United States  The first use of asphalt/bitumen in the New World was by indigenous peoples.
657	On the west coast, as early as the 13th century, the Tongva, Luiseño and Chumash peoples collected the naturally occurring asphalt/bitumen that seeped to the surface above underlying petroleum deposits.
657	All three used the substance as an adhesive.
657	It is found on many different artifacts of tools and ceremonial items.
657	For example, it was used on rattles to adhere gourds or turtle shells to rattle handles.
657	It was also used in decorations.
657	Small round shell beads were often set in asphaltum to provide decorations.
657	It was used as a sealant on baskets to make them watertight for carrying water.
657	Asphaltum was used also to seal the planks on ocean-going canoes.
657	Roads in the US have been paved with materials that include asphalt/bitumen since at least 1870, when a street in front of the Newark, NJ City Hall was paved.
657	In many cases, these early pavings were made from naturally occurring "bituminous rock".
657	In 1876, asphalt-based paving was used to pave Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC, in time for the celebration of the national centennial.
657	Asphalt/bitumen was also used for flooring, paving and waterproofing of baths and swimming pools during the early 20th century, following similar trends in Europe.
657	Modern use Rolled asphalt concrete  The largest use of asphalt/bitumen is for making asphalt concrete for road surfaces and accounts for approximately 85% of the asphalt consumed in the United States.
657	Asphalt concrete pavement material is commonly composed of 5% asphalt/bitumen cement and 95% aggregates (stone, sand, and gravel).
657	Due to its highly viscous nature, asphalt/bitumen cement must be heated so it can be mixed with the aggregates at the asphalt mixing plant.
657	There are about 4,000 asphalt concrete mixing plants in the U.S., and a similar number in Europe.
657	Asphalt concrete road surface is the most widely recycled material in the U.S., both by gross tonnage and by percentage.
657	According to an industry survey conducted by the Federal Highway Administration and the National Asphalt Pavement Association and released in 2011, more than 99% of the asphalt removed each year from road surfaces during widening and resurfacing projects is reused as part of new pavements, roadbeds, shoulders and embankments.
657	Roofing shingles account for most of the remaining asphalt/bitumen consumption.
657	Other uses include cattle sprays, fence-post treatments, and waterproofing for fabrics.
657	Asphalt concrete paving is widely used in airports around the world.
657	Due to the sturdiness and ability to be repaired quickly, it is widely used for runways dedicated to aircraft landing and taking off.
657	Mastic asphalt  Mastic asphalt is a type of asphalt which differs from dense graded asphalt (asphalt concrete) in that it has a higher asphalt/bitumen (binder) content, usually around 7–10% of the whole aggregate mix, as opposed to rolled asphalt concrete, which has only around 5% added asphalt/bitumen.
657	This thermoplastic substance is widely used in the building industry for waterproofing flat roofs and tanking underground.
657	Mastic asphalt is heated to a temperature of 210 °C and is spread in layers to form an impervious barrier about 20 millimeters (0.8 in) thick.
657	Asphalt emulsion  A number of technologies allow asphalt/bitumen to be mixed at much lower temperatures.
657	These involve mixing with petroleum solvents to form "cutbacks" with reduced melting point, or mixtures with water to turn the asphalt/bitumen into an emulsion.
657	Asphalt emulsions contain up to 70% asphalt/bitumen and typically less than 1.5% chemical additives.
657	There are two main types of emulsions with different affinity for aggregates, cationic and anionic.
657	Asphalt emulsions are used in a wide variety of applications.
657	Chipseal involves spraying the road surface with asphalt emulsion followed by a layer of crushed rock, gravel or crushed slag.
657	Slurry seal involves the creation of a mixture of asphalt emulsion and fine crushed aggregate that is spread on the surface of a road.
657	Cold-mixed asphalt can also be made from asphalt emulsion to create pavements similar to hot-mixed asphalt, several inches in depth and asphalt emulsions are also blended into recycled hot-mix asphalt to create low-cost pavements.
657	Other uses Asphalt/bitumen is used to make Japan black, a lacquer known especially for its use on iron and steel.
657	Asphalt/bitumen also is used in paint and marker inks by some graffiti supply companies (primarily Molotow) to increase the weather resistance and permanence of the paint and/or ink, and to make the color much darker.
657	Asphalt/bitumen is also used to seal some alkaline batteries during the manufacturing process.
657	Petroleum production, alternatives and bioasphalt  Naturally occurring crude Asphalt/bitumen impregnated in sedimentary rock is the prime feed stock for petroleum production from "Oil sands", currently under development in Alberta, Canada.
657	Canada has most of the world's supply of natural asphalt/bitumen, covering 140,000 square kilometres (an area larger than England), giving it the second-largest proven oil reserves in the world.
657	The Athabasca oil sands is the largest asphalt/bitumen deposit in Canada and the only one accessible to surface mining, although recent technological breakthroughs have resulted in deeper deposits becoming producible by in situ methods.
657	Because of oil price increases since 2003, upgrading bitumen to synthetic crude oil has become highly profitable.
657	As of 2006, Canadian crude asphalt/bitumen production averaged about  per day and was projected to rise to  per day by 2020.
657	The total amount of crude asphalt/bitumen in Alberta which could be extracted is estimated to be about 310 Goilbbl, which at a rate of 4400000 oilbbl/d would last about 200 years.
657	Certain activist groups have become increasingly concerned about the global peak oil and climate change problem in recent years due to byproducts released into the atmosphere.
657	Most of the emissions are derived primarily from burning fossil fuels.
657	This has led to the introduction of petroleum alternatives, such as bioasphalt, that are more environmentally friendly and less toxic.
657	Asphalt/bitumen can now be made from nonpetroleum-based renewable resources such as sugar, molasses and rice, corn and potato starches.
657	Asphalt/bitumen can also be made from waste material by fractional distillation of used motor oils, which is sometimes disposed by burning or dumping into landfills.
657	Nonpetroleum-based asphalt/bitumen binders can be made light-colored.
657	Lighter-colored roads absorb less heat from solar radiation, and have less surface heat than darker surfaces, reducing their contribution to the urban heat island effect.
659	The American National Standards Institute (ANSI, ) is a private non-profit organization that oversees the development of voluntary consensus standards for products, services, processes, systems, and personnel in the United States.
659	The organization also coordinates U.S.
659	American products can be used worldwide.
659	For example, standards ensure that people who own cameras can find the film they need for that camera anywhere around the globe.
659	ANSI accredits standards that are developed by representatives of other standards organizations, government agencies, consumer groups, companies, and others.
659	These standards ensure that the characteristics and performance of products are consistent, that people use the same definitions and terms, and that products are tested the same way.
659	ANSI also accredits organizations that carry out product or personnel certification in accordance with requirements defined in international standards.
659	The organization's headquarters are in Washington, DC.
659	ANSI's operations office is located in New York City.
659	The ANSI annual operating budget is funded by the sale of publications, membership dues and fees, accreditation services, fee-based programs, and international standards programs.
659	History  ANSI was originally formed in 1918, when five engineering societies and three government agencies founded the American Engineering Standards Committee (AESC).
659	In 1928, the AESC became the American Standards Association (ASA).
659	In 1966, the ASA was reorganized and became the United States of America Standards Institute (USASI).
659	The present name was adopted in 1969.
659	Prior to 1918, these five founding engineering societies: *American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE, now IEEE) *American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) *American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) *American Institute of Mining Engineers (AIME, now American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers) *American Society for Testing and Materials (now ASTM International) had been members of the United Engineering Society (UES).
659	At the behest of the AIEE, they invited the U.S.
659	Departments of War, Navy (combined in 1947 to become the Department of Defense or DOD) and Commerce to join in founding a national standards organization.
659	According to Paul G.
659	Agnew, the first permanent secretary and head of staff in 1919, AESC started as an ambitious program and little else.
659	Staff for the first year consisted of one executive, Clifford B.
659	LePage, who was on loan from a founding member, ASME.
659	An annual budget of $7,500 was provided by the founding bodies.
659	In 1931, the organization (renamed ASA in 1928) became affiliated with the U.S.
659	National Committee of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), which had been formed in 1904 to develop electrical and electronics standards.
659	Members ANSI's membership comprises government agencies, organizations, corporations, academic and international bodies, and individuals.
659	In total, the Institute represents the interests of more than 125,000 companies and 3.5 million professionals.
659	Process Though ANSI itself does not develop standards, the Institute oversees the develoef> Ppment and use of standards by accrediting the procedures of standards developing organizations.
659	ANSI accreditation signifies that the procedures used by standards developing organizations meet the Institute's requirements for openness, balance, consensus, and due process.
659	ANSI also designates specific standards as American National Standards, or ANS, when the Institute determines that the standards were developed in an environment that is equitable, accessible and responsive to the requirements of various stakeholders.
659	Voluntary consensus standards quicken the market acceptance of products while making clear how to improve the safety of those products for the protection of consumers.
659	There are approximately 9,500 American National Standards that carry the ANSI designation.
659	The American National Standards process involves: *consensus by a group that is open to representatives from all interested parties *broad-based public review and comment on draft standards *consideration of and response to comments *incorporation of submitted changes that meet the same consensus requirements into a draft standard *availability of an appeal by any participant alleging that these principles were not respected during the standards-development process.
659	International activities In addition to facilitating the formation of standards in the U.S., ANSI promotes the use of U.S.
659	U.S.
659	The Institute is the official U.S.
659	International Organization for Standardization (ISO), as a founding member, and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), via the U.S.
659	National Committee (USNC).
659	ANSI participates in almost the entire technical program of both the ISO and the IEC, and administers many key committees and subgroups.
659	In many instances, U.S.
659	ISO and IEC, through ANSI or the USNC, where they are adopted in whole or in part as international standards.
659	Standards panels The Institute administers five standards panels: *The ANSI Biofuels Standards Panel (ANSI-BSP) *The Healthcare Information Technology Standards Panel *The ANSI Homeland Security Standards Panel *The ANSI Nanotechnology Standards Panel *The Identity Theft Prevention and Identity Management Standards Panel Each of the panels works to identify, coordinate, and harmonize voluntary standards relevant to these areas.
659	In 2009, ANSI and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) formed the Nuclear Energy Standards Coordination Collaborative (NESCC).
659	NESCC is a joint initiative to identify and respond to the current need for standards in the nuclear industry.
659	American national standards *The ASA (as for American Standards Association) photographic exposure system, originally defined in ASA Z38.2.1 (since 1943) and ASA PH2.5 (since 1954), together with the DIN system (DIN 4512 since 1934), became the basis for the ISO system (since 1974), currently used worldwide (ISO 6, ISO 2240, ISO 5800, ISO 12232).
659	A standard for the set of values used to represent characters in digital computers.
659	The ANSI code standard extended the previously created ASCII seven bit code standard (ASA X3.4-1963), with additional codes for European alphabets (see also Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code or EBCDIC).
659	In Microsoft Windows, the phrase "ANSI" refers to the Windows ANSI code pages (even though they are not ANSI standards).
659	Most of these are fixed width, though some characters for ideographic languages are variable width.
659	Since these characters are based on a draft of the ISO-8859 series, some of Microsoft's symbols are visually very similar to the ISO symbols, leading many to falsely assume that they are identical.
659	The first computer programming language standard was "American Standard Fortran" (informally known as "FORTRAN 66"), approved in March 1966 and published as ASA X3.9-1966.
659	The programming language COBOL had ANSI standards in 1968, 1974, and 1985.
659	The COBOL 2002 standard was issued by ISO.
659	The original standard implementation of the programming language C was standardized as ANSI X3.159-1989, becoming the well-known ANSI C.
659	A popular Unified Thread Standard for nuts and bolts is ANSI/ASME B1.1 which was defined in 1935, 1949, 1989, and 2003.
659	The ANSI-NSF International standards used for commercial kitchens, such as restaurants, cafeterias, delis, etc.
659	The ANSI/APSP (Association of Pool & Spa Professionals) standards used for pools, spas, hot tubs, barriers, and suction entrapment avoidance.
659	The ANSI/HI (Hydraulic Institute) standards used for pumps.
659	The ANSI for eye protection is Z87.1, which gives a specific impact resistance rating to the eyewear.
659	This standard is commonly used for shop glasses, shooting glasses, and many other examples of protective eyewear.
659	The ANSI paper sizes (ANSI/ASME Y14.1).
659	Other initiatives *In 2008 ANSI, in  partnership with Citation Technologies, created the first dynamic, online web library for ISO 14000 standards.
659	On June 23, 2009 ANSI announced a product and services agreement with Citation Technologies to deliver all ISO Standards on a web-based platform.
659	Through the ANSI-Citation partnership, 17,765 International Standards developed by more than 3,000 ISO technical bodies will be made available on the citation platform, arming subscribers with powerful search tools and collaboration, notification, and change-management functionality.
659	ANSI, in partnership with Citation Technologies, AAMI, ASTM, and DIN, created a single, centralized database for medical device standards on September 9, 2009.
659	In early 2009, ANSI launched a new Certificate Accreditation Program (ANSI-CAP) to provide neutral, third-party attestation that a given certificate program meets the American National Standard ASTM E2659-09.
659	In 2009, ANSI began accepting applications for certification bodies seeking accreditation according to requirements defined under the Toy Safety Certification Program (TSCP) as the official third-party accreditor of TSCP’s product certification bodies.
659	In 2006, ANSI launched [http://www.standardsportal.org/ www.StandardsPortal.org], an online resource for facilitating more open and efficient trade between international markets in the areas of standards, conformity assessment, and technical regulations.
659	The site currently features content for China, India, and Korea, with additional countries and regions planned for future content.
659	ANSI design standards have also been incorporated into building codes encompassing several specific building sub-sets, suchave also h as the ANSI/SPRI ES-1, which pertains to "Wind Design Standard for Edge Systems Used With Low Slope Roofing Systems", for example.

662	Apollo 11 was the spaceflight that landed the first humans, Americans Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, on the Moon on July 20, 1969, at 20:18 UTC.
662	Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface 6 hours later on July 21 at 02:56 UTC.
662	Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less; and together they collected  of lunar material for return to Earth.
662	A third member of the mission, Michael Collins, piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it for the trip back to Earth.
662	Launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Merritt Island, Florida on July 16, Apollo 11 was the fifth manned mission of NASA's Apollo program.
662	The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a CoNASA's [mmand Module#Command Module (CM)|Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts which was the only part which landed back on Earth; a Service Module which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the Moon.
662	After being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and travelled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
662	Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the Sea of Tranquility.
662	They stayed a total of about 21 and a half hours on the lunar surface.
662	After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to Earth and landed in the Pacific Ocean on July 24.
662	Broadcast on live TV to a world-wide audience, Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface and described the event as "one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind."
662	Apollo 11 effectively ended the Space Race and fulfilled a national goal proposed in 1961 by the late U.S.
662	President John F.
662	Kennedy in a speech before the United States Congress, "before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth."
662	Framework Crew Each crewman of Apollo 11 had made a spaceflight before this mission, making it only the second all-veteran crew (the other being Apollo 10) in human spaceflight history.
662	Collins was originally slated to be the Command Module Pilot (CMP) on Apollo 8 but was removed when he required surgery on his back and was replaced by Jim Lovell, his backup for that flight.
662	After Collins was medically cleared, he took what would have been Lovell's spot on Apollo 11; as a veteran of Apollo 8, Lovell was transferred to Apollo 11's backup crew, but promoted to backup commander.
662	Backup crew In early 1969, Bill Anders accepted a job with the National Space Council effective in August 1969 and announced his retirement as an astronaut.
662	At that point Ken Mattingly was moved from the support crew into parallel training with Anders as backup Command Module Pilot in case Apollo 11 was delayed past its intended July launch (at which point Anders would be unavailable if needed) and would later join Lovell's crew and ultimately be assigned as the original Apollo 13 CMP.
662	Support crew *Charlie Duke, Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM) *Ronald Evans (CAPCOM) *Owen K.
662	Garriott (CAPCOM) *Don L.
662	Lind (CAPCOM) *Ken Mattingly (CAPCOM) *Bruce McCandless II (CAPCOM) *Harrison Schmitt (CAPCOM) *Bill Pogue *Jack Swigert Flight directors *Cliff Charlesworth (Green Team), launch and EVA *Gene Kranz (White Team), lunar landing *Glynn Lunney (Black Team), lunar ascent Call signs After the crew of Apollo 10 named their spacecraft Charlie Brown and Snoopy, assistant manager for public affairs Julian Scheer wrote to Manned Spacecraft Center director George M.
662	Low to suggest the Apollo 11 crew be less flippant in naming their craft.
662	During early mission planning, the names Snowcone and Haystack were used and put in the news release, but the crew later decided to change them.
662	The command module was named Columbia after the Columbiad, the giant cannon shell "spacecraft" fired by a giant cannon (coincidentally from Florida) in Jules Verne's 1865 novel From the Earth to the Moon.
662	The lunar module was named Eagle for the national bird of the United States, the bald eagle, which is featured prominently on the mission insignia.
662	Insignia The Apollo 11 mission insignia was designed by Collins, who wanted a symbol for "peaceful lunar landing by the United States."
662	He chose an eagle as the symbol, put an olive branch in its beak, and drew a lunar background with the Earth in the distance.
662	NASA officials said the talons of the eagle looked too "warlike" and after some discussion, the olive branch was moved to the claws.
662	The crew decided the Roman numeral XI would not be understood in some nations and went with "Apollo 11;" they decided not to put their names on the patch, so it would "be representative of everyone who had worked toward a lunar landing."
662	All colors are natural, with blue and gold borders around the patch.
662	When the Eisenhower dollar coin was released a few years later, the patch design provided the eagle for its reverse side.
662	The design was retained for the smaller Susan B.
662	Anthony dollar which was unveiled in 1979, ten years after the Apollo 11 mission.
662	Mission highlights Launch and flight to lunar orbit In addition to throngs of people crowding highways and beaches near the launch site, millions watched the event on television, with NASA Chief of Public Information Jack King providing commentary.
662	President Richard Nixon viewed the proceedings from the Oval Office of the White House.
662	A Saturn V launched Apollo 11 from Launch Pad 39A, part of the Launch Complex 39 site at the Kennedy Space Center on July 16, 1969 at 13:32:00 UTC (9:32:00 a.m.
662	EDT local time).
662	It entered orbit 12 minutes later.
662	After one and a half orbits, the S-IVB third-stage engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the Moon with the Trans Lunar Injection burn at 16:22:13 UTC.
662	About 30 minutes later the command/service module pair separated from this last remaining Saturn V stage and docked with the lunar module still nestled in the Lunar Module Adaptor.
662	After the lunar module was extracted, the combined spacecraft headed for the Moon, while the third stage booster flew on a trajectory past the Moon and into heliocentric orbit.
662	On July 19 at 17:21:50 UTC, Apollo 11 passed behind the Moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter lunar orbit.
662	In the thirty orbits that followed, the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern Sea of Tranquility (Mare Tranquillitatis) about 20 km southwest of the crater Sabine D (0.67408N, 23.47297E).
662	The landing site was selected in part because it had been characterized as relatively flat and smooth by the automated Ranger 8 and Surveyor 5 landers along with the Lunar Orbiter mapping spacecraft and unlikely to present major landing or extra-vehicular activity (EVA) challenges.
662	Lunar descent On July 20, 1969 the lunar module (LM) Eagle separated from the command module Columbia.
662	Collins, alone aboard Columbia, inspected Eagle as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged.
662	As the descent began, Armstrong and Aldrin found that they were passing landmarks on the surface 4 seconds early and reported that they were "long"; they would land miles west of their target point.
662	Five minutes into the descent burn, and 6000 ft above the surface of the Moon, the LM navigation and guidance computer distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected "1202" and "1201" program alarms.
662	Inside Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas, computer engineer Jack Garman told guidance officer Steve Bales it was safe to continue the descent and this was relayed to the crew.
662	The program alarms indicated "executive overflows", meaning the guidance computer could not complete all of its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them.
662	In a letter to Datamation, March 1, 1971, Margaret H.
662	Hamilton, Director of Apollo Flight Computer Programming MIT Draper Laboratory, Cambridge, Massachusetts, stated: “Due to an error in the checklist manual, the rendezvous radar switch was placed in the wrong position.
662	This caused it to send erroneous signals to the computer.
662	The result was that the computer was being asked to perform all of its normal functions for landing while receiving an extra load of spurious data which used up 15% of its time.
662	The computer (or rather the software in it) was smart enough to recognize that it was being asked to perform more tasks than it should be performing.
662	It then sent out an alarm, which meant to the astronaut, I'm overloaded with more tasks than I should be doing at this time and I'm going to keep only the more important tasks; i.e., the ones needed for landing...Actually, the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error conditions.
662	A complete set of recovery programs was incorporated into the software.
662	The software's action, in this case, was to eliminate lower priority tasks and re-establish the more important ones...If the computer hadn't recognized this problem and taken recovery action, I doubt if Apollo 11 would have been the successful moon landing it was”.
662	Landing When Armstrong again looked outside, he saw that the computer's landing target was in a boulder-strewn area just north and east of a 300 m diameter crater (later determined to be "West crater", named for its location in the western part of the originally planned landing ellipse).
662	Armstrong took semi-automatic control and, with Aldrin calling out altitude and velocity data, landed at 20:17 UTC on July 20 with about 25 seconds of fuel left.
662	Apollo 11 landed with less fuel than other missions, and the astronauts also encountered a premature low fuel warning.
662	This was later found to have been due to greater propellant 'slosh' than expected, uncovering a fuel sensor.
662	On subsequent missions, extra baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this.
662	Throughout the descent Aldrin had called out navigation data to Armstrong, who was busy piloting the LM.
662	A few moments before the landing, a light informed Aldrin that at least one of the 67 in probes hanging from Eagles footpads had touched the surface, and he said "Contact light!".
662	Three seconds later, Eagle landed and Armstrong said "Shutdown".
662	Aldrin immediately said "Okay, engine stop.
662	ACA - out of detent."
662	Armstrong acknowledged "Out of detent.
662	Auto" and Aldrin continued "Mode control - both auto.
662	Descent engine command override off.
662	Engine arm - off.
662	" Charles Duke, acting as CAPCOM during the landing phase, acknowledged their landing by saying "We copy you down, Eagle".
662	Armstrong acknowledged Aldrin's completion of the post landing checklist with "Engine arm is off."
662	Duke with the words, "Houston, Tranquility Base here.
662	The Eagle has landed."
662	Armstrong's change of call sign from "Eagle" to "Tranquility Base" confirmed that landing was complete and successful, and Duke mispronounced his reply as he expressed the relief at Mission Control: "Roger, Twan-- Tranquility, we copy you on the ground.
662	You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue.
662	We're breathing again.
662	Thanks a lot."
662	Two and a half hours after landing, before preparations began for the EVA, Aldrin broadcast that:  He then took communion privately.
662	At this time NASA was still fighting a lawsuit brought by atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair (who had objected to the Apollo 8 crew reading from the Book of Genesis) demanding that their astronauts refrain from broadcasting religious activities while in space.
662	As such, Aldrin chose to refrain from directly mentioning taking communion on the moon.
662	Aldrin was an elder at the Webster Presbyterian Church and his communion kit was prepared by the pastor of the church, the Rev.
662	Dean Woodruff.
662	Aldrin described communion on the Moon and the involvement of his church and pastor in the October 1970 edition of Guideposts magazine and in his book Return to Earth.
662	Webster Presbyterian possesses the chalice used on the Moon and commemorates the event each year on the Sunday closest to July 20.
662	The schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five-hour sleep period, since they had been awake since early morning.
662	However, they elected to forgo the sleep period and begin the preparations for the EVA early, thinking that they would be unable to sleep.
662	Lunar surface operations The astronauts planned placement of the Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package (EASEP) and the U.S.
662	Eagles twin triangular windows, which gave them a 60° field of view.
662	Preparation required longer than the two hours scheduled.
662	Armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his Portable Life Support System (PLSS).
662	According to veteran moon-walker John Young, a redesign of the LM to incorporate a smaller hatch had not been followed by a redesign of the PLSS backpack, so some of the highest heart rates recorded from Apollo astronauts occurred during LM egress and ingress.
662	At 02:39 UTC on Monday July 21, 1969, Armstrong opened the hatch, and at 02:51 UTC began his descent to the lunar surface.
662	The Remote Control Unit controls on his chest kept him from seeing his feet.
662	Climbing down the nine-rung ladder, Armstrong pulled a D-ring to deploy the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA) folded against Eagle's side and activate the TV camera, and at 02:56:15  UTC he set his left foot on the surface.
662	The first landing used slow-scan television incompatible with commercial TV, so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor, significantly reducing the quality of the picture.
662	The signal was received at Goldstone in the United States but with better fidelity by Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station in Australia.
662	Minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive Parkes radio telescope in Australia.
662	Despite some technical and weather difficulties, ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth.
662	Although copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available, recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were accidentally destroyed during routine magnetic tape re-use at NASA.
662	After describing the surface dust as "very fine-grained" and "almost like a powder", Armstrong stepped off Eagles footpad and uttered his famous line, "That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind" six and a half hours after landing.
662	Aldrin joined him, describing the view as "Magnificent desolation."
662	About seven minutes after stepping onto the Moon's surface, Armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick.
662	He then folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh.
662	This was to guarantee there would be some lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the EVA and return to the LM.
662	In addition to fulfilling President John F.
662	Kennedy's mandate to land a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s, Apollo 11 was an engineering test of the Apollo system; therefore, Armstrong snapped photos of the LM so engineers would be able to judge its post-landing condition.
662	He removed the TV camera from the MESA and made a panoramic sweep, then mounted it on a tripod 68 ft from the LM.
662	The TV camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the EVA.
662	Armstrong said that moving in the lunar gravity, one-sixth of Earth's, was "even perhaps easier than the simulations...
662	It's absolutely no trouble to walk around".
662	Aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around, including two-footed kangaroo hops.
662	The PLSS backpack created a tendency to tip backwards, but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance.
662	Loping became the preferred method of movement.
662	The astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead.
662	The fine soil was quite slippery.
662	Aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into Eagles shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit, though the helmet was warmer in sunlight, so he felt cooler in shadow.
662	The astronauts planted a specially designed U.S.
662	TV camera.
662	Some time later, President Richard Nixon spoke to them through a telephone-radio transmission which Nixon called "the most historic phone call ever made from the White House."
662	Nixon originally had a long speech prepared to read during the phone call, but Frank Borman, who was at the White House as a NASA liaison during Apollo 11, convinced Nixon to keep his words brief, to respect the lunar landing as Kennedy's legacy.
662	In a 2010 interview, Armstrong, who had walked a maximum of 196 ft from the LM, explained that NASA limited the first moonwalk's time and distance because there was no empirical proof of how much cooling water the astronauts' PLSS backpacks would consume to handle their body heat generation while working on the Moon.
662	Lunar ascent and return Aldrin entered Eagle first.
662	With some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing more than 22 kg of lunar surface material to the LM hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the Lunar Equipment Conveyor.
662	Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his suit pocket sleeve, and Aldrin tossed the bag down; Armstrong then jumped to the ladder's third rung and climbed into the LM.
662	After transferring to LM life support, the explorers lightened the ascent stage for return to lunar orbit by tossing out their PLSS backpacks, lunar overshoes, one Hasselblad camera, and other equipment.
662	They then pressurized the LM, and settled down to sleep.
662	While moving within the cabin, Aldrin accidentally broke the circuit breaker that would arm the main engine for lift off from the Moon.
662	There was concern this would prevent firing the engine, stranding them on the Moon.
662	Fortunately a felt-tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch.
662	Had this not worked, the Lunar Module circuitry could have been reconfigured to allow firing the ascent engine.
662	After about seven hours of rest, the crew was awakened by Houston to prepare for the return flight.
662	Two and a half hours later, at 17:54 UTC, they lifted off in Eagles ascent stage, carrying 21.5 kilograms of lunar samples with them, to rejoin CMP Michael Collins aboard Columbia in lunar orbit.
662	During the launch Aldrin looked up in time to see the exhaust from the ascent module's engine knock over the American flag they had planted.
662	After more than 2½ hours on the lunar surface, they had left behind scientific instruments that included a retroreflector array used for the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment and a Passive Seismic Experiment used to measure Moon quakes.
662	They also left an American flag, an Apollo 1 mission patch, and a plaque (mounted on the LM Descent Stage ladder) bearing two drawings of Earth (of the Western and Eastern Hemispheres), an inscription, and signatures of the astronauts and President Richard M.
662	Nixon.
662	The inscription read: They also left behind a memorial bag containing a gold replica of an olive branch as a traditional symbol of peace and a silicon message disk.
662	The disk carries the goodwill statements by Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon and messages from leaders of 73 countries around the world.
662	The disc also carries a listing of the leadership of the US Congress, a listing of members of the four committees of the House and Senate responsible for the NASA legislation, and the names of NASA's past and present top management.
662	In his 1989 book, Men from Earth, Aldrin says that the items included Soviet medals commemorating Cosmonauts Vladimir Komarov and Yuri Gagarin.) Also, according to Deke Slayton's book Moonshot, Armstrong carried with him a special diamond-studded astronaut pin from Slayton.
662	Film taken from the LM Ascent Stage upon liftoff from the Moon reveals the American flag, planted some  from the descent stage, whipping violently in the exhaust of the ascent stage engine.
662	Buzz Aldrin witnessed it topple: "The ascent stage of the LM separated ...I was concentrating on the computers, and Neil was studying the attitude indicator, but I looked up long enough to see the flag fall over."
662	Subsequent Apollo missions usually planted the American flags at least  from the LM to prevent its being blown over by the ascent engine exhaust.
662	After rendezvous with Columbia, Eagle's ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit on July 21, 1969 at 23:41 UTC.
662	Just before the Apollo 12 flight, it was noted that Eagle was still likely to be orbiting the Moon.
662	Later NASA reports mentioned that Eagle's orbit had decayed, resulting in it impacting in an "uncertain location" on the lunar surface.
662	The location is uncertain because the Eagle ascent stage was not tracked after it was jettisoned, and the lunar gravity field is sufficiently non-uniform to make the orbit of the spacecraft unpredictable after a short time.
662	NASA estimated that the orbit had decayed within months and would have impacted on the Moon.
662	On July 23, the last night before splashdown, the three astronauts made a television broadcast in which Collins commented, "...
662	The Saturn V rocket which put us in orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery, every piece of which worked flawlessly ...
662	We have always had confidence that this equipment will work properly.
662	All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of a people ...All you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others, and to all of those, I would like to say, 'Thank you very much.'" Aldrin added, "This has been far more than three men on a mission to the Moon; more, still, than the efforts of a government and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation.
662	We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown ...
662	Personally, in reflecting on the events of the past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind.
662	When I consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the Moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained; What is man that Thou art mindful of him?'" Armstrong concluded, "The responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have, through their will, indicated their desire; next with four administrations and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little EMU, the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface.
662	We would like to give special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft.
662	To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you.
662	Good night from Apollo 11."
662	On the return to Earth, a bearing at the Guam tracking station failed, which would have prevented communication on the last segment of the Earth return.
662	A regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director, Charles Force, had his ten-year old son Greg use his small hands to reach into the housing and pack it with grease.
662	Greg later was thanked by Armstrong.
662	Splashdown and quarantine   On July 24, the astronauts returned home aboard the command module Columbia just before dawn local time (16:51 UTC) at , in the Pacific Ocean 2660 km east of Wake Island, 380 km south of Johnston Atoll, and 24 km from the recovery ship, USS Hornet.
662	At 16:44 UTC the drogue parachutes had been deployed and 7 minutes later the command module struck the water forcefully.
662	The command module landed upside down but was righted within 10 minutes by flotation bags triggered by the astronauts.
662	"Everything's okay.
662	Our checklist is complete.
662	Awaiting swimmers," was Armstrong's last official transmission from the Columbia.
662	A diver from the Navy helicopter hovering above attached a sea anchor to the command module to prevent it from drifting.
662	Additional divers attached flotation collars to stabilize the module and position rafts for astronaut extraction.
662	Though the chance of bringing back pathogens from the lunar surface was considered remote, it was considered a possibility and NASA took great precautions at the recovery site.
662	Divers provided the astronauts with Biological Isolation Garments (BIGs) which were worn until they reached isolation facilities on board the Hornet.
662	Additionally astronauts were rubbed down with a sodium hypochlorite solution and the command module wiped with Betadine to remove any lunar dust that might be present.
662	The raft containing decontamination materials was then intentionally sunk.
662	A second Sea King helicopter hoisted the astronauts aboard one by one, where a NASA flight surgeon gave each a brief physical check during the  trip back to the Hornet.
662	After touchdown on the Hornet, the astronauts exited the helicopter, leaving the flight surgeon and three crewmen.
662	The helicopter was then lowered into hangar bay #2 where the astronauts walked the 30 ft to the Mobile Quarantine Facility (MQF) where they would begin their 21 days of quarantine.
662	This practice would continue for two more Apollo missions, Apollo 12 and Apollo 14, before the Moon was proven to be barren of life and the quarantine process dropped.
662	President Richard Nixon was aboard Hornet to personally welcome the astronauts back to Earth.
662	He told the astronauts, "As a result of what you've done, the world has never been closer together before."
662	After Nixon departed, the Hornet was brought alongside the five-ton command module where it was placed aboard by the ship's crane, placed on a dolly and moved next to the MQF.
662	The Hornet sailed for Pearl Harbor where the command module and MQF were airlifted to the Johnson Space Center.
662	Years later, it was publicly revealed that Nixon had prepared a speech to be given in the event the Lunar Module had failed to lift off from the lunar surface, which would have resulted in Armstrong's and Aldrin's deaths, similar to common newspaper obituary or government contingency plan procedures and policies.
662	In accordance with the recently passed Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law, the astronauts were placed in quarantine for fear that the Moon might contain undiscovered pathogens and that the astronauts might have been exposed to them during their Moon walks.
662	However, after almost three weeks in confinement (first in their trailer and later in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory at the Manned Spacecraft Center), the astronauts were given a clean bill of health.
662	On August 10, 1969, the astronauts exited quarantine.
662	Celebration On August 13, they rode in parades in their honor in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles.
662	On the same evening in Los Angeles there was an official State Dinner to celebrate the flight, attended by members of Congress, 44 governors, the Chief Justice of the United States, and ambassadors from 83 nations at the Century Plaza Hotel.
662	President Richard Nixon and Vice President Spiro T.
662	Agnew honored each astronaut with a presentation of the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
662	This celebration was the beginning of a 45-day "Giant Leap" tour that brought the astronauts to 25 foreign countries and included visits with prominent leaders such as Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom.
662	Many nations would honor the first manned Moon landing by issuing Apollo 11 commemorative postage stamps or coins.
662	On September 16, 1969, the three astronauts spoke before a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill.
662	They presented two U.S.
662	House of Representatives and the other to the Senate, that had been carried to the surface of the Moon with them.
662	Moon race The Soviet Union was secretly attempting to compete with the US in landing a man on the Moon, but had been hampered by repeated failures in development of a launcher comparable to the Saturn V.
662	Meanwhile, they tried to beat the US to return lunar material to the Earth, by means of unmanned probes.
662	On July 13, three days before Apollo 11's launch, they launched Luna 15 which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11.
662	During descent, a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in Mare Crisium, about two hours before Armstrong and Aldrin took off from the surface.
662	The Jodrell Bank Observatory radio telescope in England was later discovered to have recorded transmissions from Luna 15 during its descent, and this was published in July 2009 on the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11.
662	Spacecraft location The command module is displayed at the National Air and Space Museum, Washington, D.C.
662	It is in the central Milestones of Flight exhibition hall in front of the Jefferson Drive entrance, sharing the main hall with other pioneering flight vehicles such as the Wright Flyer, the Spirit of St.
662	Louis, the Bell X-1, the North American X-15, Mercury spacecraft Friendship 7, and Gemini 4.
662	Armstrong's and Aldrin's space suits are displayed in the museum's Apollo to the Moon exhibit.
662	The quarantine trailer, the flotation collar, and the righting spheres are displayed at the Smithsonian's Udvar-Hazy Center annex near Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia.
662	In 2009 the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter imaged the various Apollo landing sites on the surface of the Moon with sufficient resolution to see the descent stages of the lunar modules, scientific instruments, and foot trails made by the astronauts.
662	In March 2012 Amazon founder Jeff Bezos located the F-1 engines that launched Apollo 11 into space.
662	The engines were found below the Atlantic Ocean's surface through the use of advanced sonar scanning.
662	His team plans to bring at least one of the five engines to the surface.
662	On July 15, 2009, Life.com released a photo gallery of previously unpublished photos of the astronauts taken by Life photographer Ralph Morse prior to the Apollo 11 launch.
662	From July 16–24, 2009 NASA streamed the original mission audio on its website in real time 40 years to the minute after the events occurred.
662	In addition, it is in the process of restoring the video footage and has released a preview of key moments.
662	The John F.
662	Kennedy Library set up a Flash website that rebroadcasts the transmissions of Apollo 11 from launch to landing on the Moon.
662	A group of British scientists interviewed as part of the anniversary events reflected on the significance of the Moon landing: It was carried out in a technically brilliant way with risks taken ...
662	The Apollo programme is arguably the greatest technical achievement of mank-averse wkind to date...nothing since Apollo has come close [to] the excitement that was generated by those astronauts - Armstrong, Aldrin and the 10 others who followed them.
662	On August 7, 2009, an act of Congress awarded the three astronauts a Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian award in the United States.
662	The bill was sponsored by Florida Sen.
662	Bill Nelson and Florida Rep.
662	Alan Grayson.
662	In July 2010, air to ground voice recordings and film footage shot in Mission Control during the Apollo 11 powered descent and landing was re-synchronised and released for the first time.

663	Apollo 8, the second manned mission in the United States Apollo space program, was launched on December 21, 1968 and became the first manned space craft to leave Earth orbit, reach the Earth's Moon, orbit it and return safely to Earth.
663	The three-astronaut crew — Commander Frank Borman, Command Module Pilot James Lovell, and Lunar Module Pilot William Anders — became the first humans to travel beyond low Earth orbit, the first to see Earth as a whole planet, and then the first to directly see the far side of the Moon.
663	The 1968 mission, the third flight of the Saturn V rocket and the first manned launch of the Saturn V, was also the first manned launch from the John F.
663	Kennedy Space Center, Florida, located adjacent to Cape Canaveral.
663	Originally planned as a second Lunar Module/Command Module test in an elliptical medium Earth orbit in early 1969, the mission profile was changed in August 1968 to a more ambitious Command Module-only lunar orbital flight to be flown in December, because the Lunar Module was not yet ready to make its first flight.
663	This meant Borman's crew was scheduled to fly two to three months sooner than originally planned, leaving them a shorter time for training and preparation, thus placing more demands than usual on their time and discipline.
663	Apollo 8 took three days to travel to the Moon.
663	It orbited ten times over the course of 20 hours, during which the crew made a Christmas Eve television broadcast in which they read the first 10 verses from the Book of Genesis.
663	At the time, the broadcast was the most watched TV pirst 10 verses frorogram ever.
663	Apollo 8's successful mission paved the way for Apollo 11 to fulfill U.S.
663	President John F.
663	Kennedy's goal of landing a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s.
663	The Apollo 8 astronauts returned to Earth on December 27, 1968, when their space craft splashed down in the Northern Pacific Ocean.
663	Crew This crew was unique among pre-shuttle era missions in that the commander was not the most experienced member of the crew.
663	This was also the first case of the rarity of an astronaut who had flown as commander subsequently flying as a non-commander, as Lovell had previously commanded Gemini XII.
663	Backup crew On a lunar mission, the Command Module Pilot (CMP) was assigned the role of navigator, while the Lunar Module Pilot (LMP) was assigned the role of flight engineer, responsible for monitoring all spacecraft systems, even if the flight didn't include a Lunar Module.
663	Lovell was originally the CMP on the back-up crew, with Michael Collins as the prime crew's CMP.
663	However, Collins was replaced in July 1968, after suffering a cervical disc herniation that required surgery to repair.
663	Edwin Aldrin was originally the backup LMP.
663	When Lovell was rotated to the prime crew, no one with experience on CSM 103 (the specific spacecraft used for the mission) was available, so Aldrin was moved to CMP and Fred Haise brought in as backup LMP.
663	Neil Armstrong went on to command Apollo 11, where Aldrin was returned to the LMP position, and Collins was assigned as CMP.
663	Mission control The Earth-based mission control teams for Apollo 8 consisted of astronauts assigned to the support crew, as well as non-astronaut flight directors and their staffs.
663	The support crew members were not trained to fly the mission, but were able to stand in for astronauts in meetings and be involved in the minutiae of mission planning, while the prime and backup crews trained.
663	They also served as CAPCOMs during the mission.
663	For Apollo 8, these crew members included astronauts John S.
663	Bull, Vance D.
663	Brand, Gerald P.
663	Carr, and Ken Mattingly.
663	The mission control teams on Earth rotated in three shifts, each led by a flight director.
663	The directors for Apollo 8 included Cliff Charlesworth (Green team), Glynn Lunney (Black team), and Milton Windler (Maroon team).
663	Mission insignia The triangular shape of the insignia symbolizes the shape of the Apollo command module.
663	It shows a red figure 8 looping around the Earth and Moon representing the mission number as well as the circumlunar nature of the mission.
663	On the red number 8 are the names of the three astronauts.
663	The initial design of the insignia was developed by Jim Lovell.
663	Lovell reportedly sketched the initial design while riding in the backseat of a T-38 flight from California to Houston, shortly after learning of the re-designation of the flight to become a lunar orbital mission.
663	The graphic design of the insignia was done by Houston artist and animator William Bradley.
663	Planning Apollo 4 and Apollo 6 had been "A" missions, unmanned tests of the Saturn V launch vehicle using an unmanned Block I production model of the Apollo Command and Service Module in Earth Orbit.
663	October 1968, would be a manned Earth Orbit flight of the CSM, completing the objectives for Mission "C".
663	Further missions depended on the readiness of the Lunar Module (LM).
663	Apollo 8 was planned as the "D" mission, to test the LM in a low Earth orbit in December 1968 by James McDivitt, David Scott and Russell Schweickart, while Borman's crew would fly the "E" mission, a more rigorous LM test in an elliptical medium Earth orbit as Apollo 9, in early 1969.
663	But production of the LM fell behind schedule, and when Apollo 8's LM arrived at Cape Canaveral in June 1968, significant defects were discovered, leading Grumman, the lead contractor for the LM, to predict that the first mission-ready LM would not be ready until at least February 1969.
663	This would mean delaying the "D" and subsequent missions, endangering the program's goal of a lunar landing before the end of 1969.
663	George Low, the Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, proposed a solution in August to keep the program on track despite the LM delay.
663	Since the Command/Service Module (CSM) would be ready three months before the Lunar Module, a CSM-only mission could be flown in December 1968.
663	Instead of just repeating the "C" mission flight of Apollo 7, this CSM could be sent all the way to the Moon, with the possibility of entering a lunar orbit.
663	The new mission would also allow NASA to test lunar landing procedures that would otherwise have to wait until Apollo 10, the scheduled "F" mission.
663	This also meant that the medium Earth orbit "E" mission could be dispensed with.
663	The net result was that only the "D" mission had to be delayed.
663	Almost every senior manager at NASA agreed with this new mission, citing both confidence in the hardware and personnel, and the potential for a significant morale boost provided by a circumlunar flight.
663	The only person who needed some convincing was James E.
663	Webb, the NASA administrator.
663	With the rest of his agency in support of the new mission, Webb eventually approved the mission change.
663	The mission was officially changed from a "D" mission to a "C-Prime" Lunar Orbit mission, but was still referred to in press releases as an Earth Orbit mission at Webb's direction.
663	No public announcement was made about the change in mission until November 12, three weeks after Apollo 7's successful Earth orbit mission and less than 40 days before launch.
663	With the change in mission for Apollo 8, Director of Flight Crew Operations Deke Slayton decided to swap the crews of the D and E missions.
663	This swap also meant a swap of spacecraft, requiring Borman's crew to use CSM-103, while McDivitt's crew would use CSM-104.
663	On September 9, the crew entered the simulators to begin their preparation for the flight.
663	By the time the mission flew, the crew had spent seven hours training for every actual hour of flight.
663	Although all crew members were trained in all aspects of the mission, it was necessary to specialize.
663	Borman, as commander, was given training on controlling the spacecraft during the re-entry.
663	Lovell was trained on navigating the spacecraft in case communication was lost with the Earth.
663	Anders was placed in charge of checking that the spacecraft was in working order.
663	Added pressure on the Apollo program to make its 1969 landing goal was provided by the Soviet Union's flight of some living creatures, including Russian tortoises, in a cislunar loop around the Moon on Zond 5 and return to Earth on September 21.
663	There was speculation within NASA and the press that they might be preparing to launch cosmonauts on a similar circumlunar mission before the end of 1968.
663	The Apollo 8 crew, now living in the crew quarters at Kennedy Space Center, received a visit from Charles Lindbergh and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, the night before the launch.
663	They talked about how, before his 1927 flight, Lindbergh had used a piece of string to measure the distance from New York City to Paris on a globe and from that calculated the fuel needed for the flight.
663	The total was a tenth of the amount that the Saturn V would burn every second.
663	The next day, the Lindberghs watched the launch of Apollo 8 from a nearby dune.
663	Saturn V The Saturn V rocket used by Apollo 8 was designated SA-503, or the "03rd" model of the Saturn V ("5") Rocket to be used in the Saturn-Apollo ("SA") program.
663	When it was erected in the Vertical Assembly Building on December 20, 1967, it was thought that the rocket would be used for an unmanned Earth-orbit test flight carrying a boilerplate Command/Service Module.
663	Apollo 6 had suffered several major problems during its April 1968 flight, including severe pogo oscillation during its first stage, two second stage engine failures, and a third stage that failed to reignite in orbit.
663	Without assurances that these problems had been rectified, NASA administrators could not justify risking a manned mission until additional unmanned test flights proved that the Saturn V was ready.
663	Teams from the Marshall Space Flight Cen 09 2008 &ter (MSFC) went to work on the problems.
663	Of primary concern was the pogo oscillation, which would not only hamper engine performance, but could exert significant g-forces on a crew.
663	A task force of contractors, NASA agency representatives, and MSFC researchers concluded that the engines vibrated at a frequency similar to the frequency at which the spacecraft itself vibrated, causing a resonance effect that induced oscillations in the rocket.
663	A system using helium gas to absorb some of these vibrations was installed.
663	Of equal importance was the failure of three engines during flight.
663	Researchers quickly determined that a leaking hydrogen fuel line ruptured when exposed to vacuum, causing a loss of fuel pressure in engine two.
663	When an automatic shutoff attempted to close the liquid hydrogen valve and shut down engine two, it accidentally shut down engine three's liquid oxygen due to a miswired connection.
663	As a result, engine three failed within one second of engine two's shutdown.
663	Further investigation revealed the same problem for the third-stage engine—a faulty igniter line.
663	The team modified the igniter lines and fuel conduits, hoping to avoid similar problems on future launches.
663	The teams tested their solutions in August 1968 at the Marshall Space Flight Center.
663	A Saturn stage IC was equipped with shock absorbing devices to demonstrate the team's solution to the problem of pogo oscillation, while a Saturn Stage II was retrofitted with modified fuel lines to demonstrate their resistance to leaks and ruptures in vacuum conditions.
663	Once NASA administrators were convinced that the problems were solved, they gave their approval for a manned mission using SA-503.
663	The Apollo 8 spacecraft was placed on top of the rocket on September 21 and the rocket made the slow 3-mile (5 km) journey to the launch pad on October 9.
663	Testing continued all through December until the day before launch, including various levels of readiness testing from December 5 through 11.
663	Final testing of modifications to address the problems of pogo oscillation, ruptured fuel lines, and bad igniter lines took place on December 18, a mere three days before the scheduled launch.
663	Mission Parameter summary As the first manned spacecraft to orbit more than one celestial body, Apollo 8's profile had two different sets of orbital parameters, separated by a translunar injection maneuver.
663	Apollo lunar missions would begin with a nominal 100 nmi circular Earth parking orbit.
663	Apollo 8 was launched into an initial orbit with an apogee of  and a perigee of , with an inclination of 32.51° to the Equator, and an orbital period of 88.19 minutes.
663	Propellant venting increased the apogee by  over the 2 hours, 44 minutes and 30 seconds spent in the parking orbit.
663	This was followed by a Trans-Lunar Injection (TLI) burn of the S-IVB third stage for 318 seconds, accelerating the 63531 lb spacecraft from an orbital velocity of 25567 ft/s to the injection velocity of 35505 ft/s, which set a record for the highest speed, relative to Earth, that humans had ever traveled.
663	This speed was slightly less than the Earth's escape velocity of 36747 ft/s, but put Apollo 8 into an elongated elliptical Earth orbit, to a point where the Moon's gravity would capture it.
663	The standard lunar orbit for Apollo missions was planned as a nominal 60 nmi circular orbit above the Moon's surface.
663	Initial lunar orbit insertion was an ellipse with a perilune of   and an apolune of , at an inclination of 12° from the lunar equator.
663	This was then circularized at  by , with an orbital period of 128.7 minutes.
663	The effect of lunar mass concentrations ("masscons") on the orbit was found to be greater than initially predicted; over the course of the twenty-hour mission, the orbit was perturbated to  by .
663	Apollo 8 achieved a maximum distance from Earth of .
663	Launch and trans-lunar injection Apollo 8 launched at 7:51:00 a.m.
663	Eastern Standard Time on December 21, 1968, using the Saturn V's three stages, S-IC, S-II, and S-IVB, to achieve Earth orbit.
663	The launch phase experienced only three minor problems: The engines of the first stage, S-IC, underperformed by 0.75%, causing the engines to burn for 2.45 seconds longer than planned, and toward the end of the second stage burn, S-II, the rocket underwent pogo oscillations.
663	Frank Borman estimated the oscillations were approximately  and  (±2.5 m/s2).
663	All three rocket stages fired during launch; the S-IC and S-II detached during launch.
663	The S-IC impacted the Atlantic Ocean at  and the S-II second stage at .
663	The third stage of the rocket, S-IVB, assisted in driving the craft into Earth orbit but remained attached to later perform the TLI burn that would put the spacecraft on a trajectory to the Moon.
663	Once in Earth orbit, both the Apollo 8 crew and Mission Control spent the next 2 hours and 38 minutes checking that the spacecraft was in proper working order and ready for TLI.
663	The proper operation of third stage of the rocket, S-IVB, was crucial: in the last unmanned test, the S-IVB had failed to re-ignite for TLI.
663	During the flight, three fellow astronauts served on the ground as capsule communicators (usually referred to as "CAPCOMs") on a rotating schedule.
663	The CAPCOMs were the only people who regularly communicated with the crew.
663	Michael Collins was the first CAPCOM on duty and at 2 hours, 27 minutes and 22 seconds after launch radioed, "Apollo 8.
663	You are Go for TLI".
663	This communication signified that Mission Control had given official permission for Apollo 8 to go to the Moon.
663	Over the next 12 minutes before the TLI burn, the Apollo 8 crew continued to monitor the spacecraft and the S-IVB.
663	The engine ignited on time and performed the TLI burn perfectly.
663	After the S-IVB had performed its required tasks, it was jettisoned.
663	The crew then rotated the spacecraft to take some photographs of the spent stage and then practiced flying in formation with it.
663	As the crew rotated the spacecraft, they had their first views of the Earth as they moved away from it.
663	This marked the first time humans could view the whole Earth at once.
663	Borman became worried that the S-IVB was staying too close to the Command/Service Module and suggested to Mission Control that the crew perform a separation maneuver.
663	Mission Control first suggested pointing the spacecraft towards Earth and using the Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters on the Service Module to add 3 ft/s away from the Earth, but Borman did not want to lose sight of the S-IVB.
663	After discussion, the crew and Mission Control decided to burn in this direction, but at 9 ft/s instead.
663	These discussions put the crew an hour behind their flight plan.
663	Five hours after launch, Mission Control sent a command to the S-IVB booster to vent its remaining fuel through its engine bell to change the booster's trajectory.
663	This S-IVB would then pass the Moon and enter into a solar orbit, posing no further hazard to Apollo 8.
663	The S-IVB subsequently went into a  solar orbit with an inclination of 23.47° from the plane of the ecliptic, and an orbital period of 340.80 days.
663	The Apollo 8 crew were the first humans to pass through the Van Allen radiation belts, which extend up to 15000 mi from Earth.
663	Scientists predicted that passing through the belts quickly at the spacecraft's high speed would cause a radiation dosage of no more than a chest X-ray, or 1 milligray (during the course of a year, the average human receives a dose of 2 to 3 mGy).
663	To record the actual radiation dosages, each crew member wore a Personal Radiation Dosimeter that transmitted data to Earth as well as three passive film dosimeters that showed the cumulative radiation experienced by the crew.
663	By the end of the mission, the crew experienced an average radiation dose of 1.6 mGy.
663	Lunar trajectory Jim Lovell's main job as Command Module Pilot was as navigator.
663	Although Mission Control performed all of the actual navigation calculations, it was necessary to have a crew member serving as navigator so that the crew could successfully return to Earth in case of communication loss with Mission Control.
663	Lovell navigated by star sightings using a sextant built into the spacecraft, measuring the angle between a star and the Earth's (or the Moon's) horizon.
663	This task proved to be difficult, as a large cloud of debris around the spacecraft formed by the venting S-IVB made it hard to distinguish the stars.
663	By seven hours into the mission, the crew was about one hour and 40 minutes behind flight plan due to the issues of moving away from the S-IVB and Lovell's obscured star sightings.
663	The crew now placed the spacecraft into Passive Thermal Control (PTC), also known as "barbecue" roll.
663	PTC involved the spacecraft rotating about once per hour along its long axis to ensure even heat distribution across the surface of the spacecraft.
663	In direct sunlight, the spacecraft could be heated to over 200 C while the parts in shadow would be .
663	These temperatures could cause the heat shield to crack or propellant lines to burst.
663	As it was impossible to get a perfect roll, the spacecraft actually swept out a cone as it rotated.
663	The crew had to make minor adjustments every half hour as the cone pattern got larger and larger.
663	The first mid-course correction came 11 hours into the flight.
663	Testing on the ground had shown that the Service Propulsion System (SPS) engine had a small chance of exploding when burned for long periods unless its combustion chamber was "coated" first.
663	Burning the engine for a short period would accomplish coating.
663	This first correction burn was only 2.4 seconds and added about  velocity prograde (in the direction of travel).
663	This change was less than the planned  due to a bubble of helium in the oxidizer lines causing lower than expected fuel pressure.
663	The crew had to use the small Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters to make up the shortfall.
663	Two later planned mid-course corrections were canceled as the Apollo 8 trajectory was found to be perfect.
663	Before launch, NASA had decided that at least one crew member should be awake at all times to deal with any issues that might arise.
663	Borman started the first sleep shift, but between the constant radio chatter and mechanical noises, he found sleep difficult.
663	About an hour after starting his sleep shift, Borman requested clearance to take a Seconal sleeping pill.
663	However, the pill had little effect.
663	Borman eventually fell asleep but then awoke feeling ill.
663	He vomited twice and had a bout of diarrhea that left the spacecraft full of small globules of vomit and feces that the crew cleaned up to the best of their ability.
663	Borman initially decided that he did not want everyone to know about his medical problems, but Lovell and Anders wanted to inform Mission Control.
663	The crew decided to use the Data Storage Equipment (DSE), which could tape voice recordings and telemetry and dump them to Mission Control at high speed.
663	After recording a description of Borman's illness they requested that Mission Control check the recording, stating that they "would like an evaluation of the voice comments".
663	The Apollo 8 crew and Mission Control medical personnel held a conference using an unoccupied second floor control room (there were two identical control rooms in Houston on the second and third floor, only one of which was used during a mission).
663	The conference participants decided that there was little to worry about and that Borman's illness was either a 24-hour flu, as Borman thought, or a reaction to the sleeping pill.
663	Researchers now believe that he was suffering from space adaptation syndrome, which affects about a third of astronauts during their first day in space as their vestibular system adapts to weightlessness.
663	Space adaptation syndrome had not been an issue on previous spacecraft (Mercury and Gemini), as those astronauts were unable to move freely in the comparatively smaller cabins of those spacecraft.
663	The increased cabin space in the Apollo Command Module afforded astronauts greater freedom of movement, contributing to symptoms of spacesickness for Borman and, later, astronaut Russell Schweickart during Apollo 9.
663	The cruise phase was a relatively uneventful part of the flight, except for the crew checking that the spacecraft was in working order and that they were on course.
663	During this time, NASA scheduled a television broadcast at 31 hours after launch.
663	The Apollo 8 crew used a 2 kg camera that broadcast in black-and-white only, using a Vidicon tube.
663	The camera had two lenses, a very wide-angle (160°) lens, and a telephoto (9°) lens.
663	During this first broadcast, the crew gave a tour of the spacecraft and attempted to show how the Earth appeared from space.
663	However, difficulties aiming the narrow-angle lens without the aid of a monitor to show what it was looking at made showing the Earth impossible.
663	Additionally, the Earth image became saturated by any bright source without proper filters.
663	In the end, all the crew could show the people watching back on Earth was a bright blob.
663	After broadcasting for 17 minutes, the rotation of the spacecraft took the high-gain antenna out of view of the receiving stations on Earth and they ended the transmission with Lovell wishing his mother a happy birthday.
663	By this time, the crew had completely abandoned the planned sleep shifts.
663	Lovell went to sleep 32½ hours into the flight—3½ hours before he had planned to.
663	A short while later, Anders also went to sleep after taking a sleeping pill.
663	The crew was unable to see the Moon for much of the outward cruise.
663	Two factors made the Moon almost impossible to see from inside the spacecraft: three of the five windows fogging up due to out-gassed oils from the silicone sealant, and the attitude required for the PTC.
663	It was not until the crew had gone behind the Moon that they would be able to see it for the first time.
663	The Apollo 8 made a second television broadcast at 55 hours into the flight.
663	This time, the crew rigged up filters meant for the still cameras so they could acquire images of the Earth through the telephoto lens.
663	Although difficult to aim, as they had to maneuver the entire spacecraft, the crew was able to broadcast back to Earth the first television pictures of the Earth.
663	The crew spent the transmission describing the Earth and what was visible and the colors they could see.
663	The transmission lasted 23 minutes.
663	Lunar sphere of influence At about 55 hours and 40 minutes into the flight, the crew of Apollo 8 became the first humans to enter the gravitational sphere of influence of another celestial body.
663	In other words, the effect of the Moon's gravitational force on Apollo 8 became stronger than that of the Earth.
663	At the time it happened, Apollo 8 was 38759 mi from the Moon and had a speed of 3990 ft/s relative to the Moon.
663	This historic moment was of little interest to the crew since they were still calculating their trajectory with respect to the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center.
663	They would continue to do so until they performed their last mid-course correction, switching to a reference frame based on ideal orientation for the second engine burn they would make in lunar orbit.
663	It was only 13 hours until they would be in lunar orbit.
663	The last major event before Lunar Orbit Insertion was a second mid-course correctio'lostmoon'/&gtn.
663	It was in retrograde (against direction of travel) and slowed the spacecraft down by , effectively lowering the closest distance that the spacecraft would pass the moon.
663	At exactly 61 hours after launch, about 24200 mi from the Moon, the crew burned the RCS for 11 seconds.
663	They would now pass  from the lunar surface.
663	At 64 hours into the flight, the crew began to prepare for Lunar Orbit Insertion-1 (LOI-1).
663	This maneuver had to be performed perfectly, and due to orbital mechanics had to be on the far side of the Moon, out of contact with the Earth.
663	After Mission Control was polled for a Go/No Go decision, the crew was told at 68 hours, they were Go and "riding the best bird we can find".
663	At 68 hours and 58 minutes, the spacecraft went behind the Moon and out of radio contact with the Earth.
663	With 10 minutes before the LOI-1, the crew began one last check of the spacecraft systems and made sure that every switch was in the correct place.
663	At that time, they finally got their first glimpses of the Moon.
663	They had been flying over the unlit side, and it was Lovell who saw the first shafts of sunlight obliquely illuminating the lunar surface.
663	The LOI burn was only two minutes away, so the crew had little time to appreciate the view.
663	Lunar orbit The SPS ignited at 69 hours, 8 minutes, and 16 seconds after launch and burned for 4 minutes and 13 seconds, placing the Apollo 8 spacecraft in orbit around the Moon.
663	The crew described the burn as being the longest four minutes of their lives.
663	If the burn had not lasted exactly the correct amount of time, the spacecraft could have ended up in a highly elliptical lunar orbit or even flung off into space.
663	If it lasted too long they could have impacted the Moon.
663	After making sure the spacecraft was working, they finally had a chance to look at the Moon, which they would orbit for the next 20 hours.
663	On Earth, Mission Control continued to wait.
663	If the crew had not burned the engine or the burn had not lasted the planned length of time, the crew would appear early from behind the Moon.
663	However, this time came and went without Apollo 8 reappearing.
663	Exactly at the calculated moment, the signal was received from the spacecraft, indicating it was in a  orbit about the Moon.
663	After reporting on the status of the spacecraft, Lovell gave the first description of what the lunar surface looked like: Lovell continued to describe the terrain they were passing over.
663	One of the crew's major tasks was reconnaissance of planned future landing sites on the Moon, especially one in Mare Tranquillitatis that would be the Apollo 11 landing site.
663	The launch time of Apollo 8 had been chosen to give the best lighting conditions for examining the site.
663	A film camera had been set up in one of the spacecraft windows to record a frame every second of the Moon below.
663	Bill Anders spent much of the next 20 hours taking as many photographs as possible of targets of interest.
663	By the end of the mission the crew had taken 700 photographs of the Moon and 150 of the Earth.
663	Throughout the hour that the spacecraft was in contact with Earth, Borman kept asking how the data for the SPS looked.
663	He wanted to make sure that the engine was working and could be used to return early to the Earth if necessary.
663	He also asked that they receive a Go/No Go decision before they passed behind the Moon on each orbit.
663	As they reappeared for their second pass in front of the Moon, the crew set up the equipment to broadcast a view of the lunar surface.
663	Anders described the craters that they were passing over.
663	At the end of this second orbit they performed the 11-second LOI-2 burn of the SPS to circularize the orbit to .
663	Through the next two orbits, the crew continued to keep check of the spacecraft and to observe and photograph the Moon.
663	During the third pass, Borman read a small prayer for his church.
663	He had been scheduled to participate in a service at St.
663	Christopher's Episcopal Church near Seabrook, Texas, but due to the Apollo 8 flight was unable.
663	A fellow parishioner and engineer at Mission Control, Rod Rose, suggested that Borman read the prayer which could be recorded and then replayed during the service.
663	In the foreword to the Millennial Edition of his novel 2001: A Space Odyssey Arthur C.
663	Clarke says that crew told him "they had been tempted to radio back the discovery of a large black monolith," but discretionot;they had been prevailed.
663	Earthrise When the spacecraft came out from behind the Moon for its fourth pass across the front, the crew witnessed Earthrise for the first time in human history (NASA's Lunar Orbiter 1 took the very first picture of an Earthrise from the vicinity of the Moon, on August 23, 1966).
663	Borman saw the Earth emerging from behind the lunar horizon and called in excitement to the others, taking a black-and-white photo as he did so.
663	In the ensuing scramble Anders took the more famous color photo, later picked by Life magazine as one of its hundred photos of the century.
663	Due to the synchronous rotation of the Moon about the Earth, Earthrise is not generally visible from the Lunar surface.
663	Earthrise is generally only visible when orbiting the Moon, other than at selected places near the Moon's limb, where libration carries the Earth slightly above and below the lunar horizon.
663	Anders continued to take photographs while Lovell assumed control of the spacecraft so Borman could rest.
663	Despite the difficulty resting in the cramped and noisy spacecraft, Borman was able to sleep for two orbits, awakening periodically to ask questions about their status.
663	Borman awoke fully, however, when he started to hear his fellow crew members make mistakes.
663	They were beginning to not understand questions and would have to ask for the answers to be repeated.
663	Borman realized that everyone was extremely tired having not had a good night's sleep in over three days.
663	Taking command, he ordered Anders and Lovell to get some sleep and that the rest of the flight plan regarding observing the Moon be scrubbed.
663	At first Anders protested saying that he was fine, but Borman would not be swayed.
663	At last Anders agreed as long as Borman would set up the camera to continue to take automatic shots of the Moon.
663	Borman also remembered that there was a second television broadcast planned, and with so many people expected to be watching he wanted the crew to be alert.
663	For the next two orbits Anders and Lovell slept while Borman sat at the helm.
663	On subsequent Apollo missions, crews would avoid this situation by sleeping on the same schedule.
663	As they rounded the Moon for the ninth time, the second television transmission began.
663	Borman introduced the crew, followed by each man giving his impression of the lunar surface and what it was like to be orbiting the Moon.
663	Borman described it as being "a vast, lonely, forbidding expanse of nothing."
663	Then, after talking about what they were flying over, Anders said that the crew had a message for all those on Earth.
663	Each man on board read a section from the Biblical creation story (verses 1-10) from the Book of Genesis.
663	Borman finished the broadcast by wishing a Merry Christmas to everyone on Earth.
663	His message appeared to sum up the feelings that all three crewmen had from their vantage point in lunar orbit.
663	Borman said, "And from the crew of Apollo 8, we close with good night, good luck, a Merry Christmas, and God bless all of you, all of you on the good Earth".
663	The only task left for the crew at this point was to perform the Trans-Earth Injection (TEI), which was scheduled for 2½ hours after the end of the television transmission.
663	The TEI was the most critical burn of the flight, as any failure of the SPS to ignite would strand the crew in Lunar orbit, with little hope of escape.
663	As with the previous burn, the crew had to perform the maneuver above the far side of the Moon, out of contact with Earth.
663	The burn occurred exactly on time.
663	The spacecraft telemetry was reacquired as it re-emerged from behind the Moon at 89 hours, 28 minutes, and 39 seconds, the exact time calculated.
663	When voice contact was regained, Lovell announced, "Please be informed, there is a Santa Claus", to which Ken Mattingly, the current CAPCOM, replied, "That's affirmative, you are the best ones to know".
663	The spacecraft began its journey back to Earth on December 25, Christmas Day.
663	Unplanned manual re-alignment Later, Lovell used some otherwise idle time to do some navigational sightings, maneuvering the module to view various stars by using the computer keyboard.
663	However, he accidentally erased some of the computer's memory, which caused the inertial measuring unit (IMU) to think the module was in the same relative position it had been in before lift-off and fire the thrusters to "correct" the module's attitude.
663	Once the crew realized why the computer had changed the module's attitude, they realized they would have to re-enter data that would tell the computer its real position.
663	It took Lovell ten minutes to figure out the right numbers, using the thrusters to get the stars Rigel and Sirius aligned, and another 15 minutes to enter the corrected data into the computer.
663	Lovell would once again have to perform a similar manual re-alignment, under more critical conditions, during the Apollo 13 mission, after that module's IMU had to be turned off to conserve energy.
663	In his 1994 book, Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13, Lovell wrote, "My training [on Apollo 8] came in handy!"
663	In that book he dismissed the incident as a "planned experiment", requested by the ground crew.
663	In subsequent interviews Lovell has acknowledged that the incident was an accident, caused by his mistake.
663	Cruise back to Earth and re-entry The cruise back to Earth was mostly a time for the crew to relax and monitor the spacecraft.
663	As long as the trajectory specialists had calculated everything correctly, the spacecraft would re-enter two-and-half days after TEI and splash down in the Pacific.
663	On Christmas afternoon, the crew made their fifth television broadcast.
663	This time they gave a tour of the spacecraft, showing how an astronaut lived in space.
663	When they finished broadcasting they found a small present from Deke Slayton in the food locker: a real turkey dinner with stuffing, in the same kind of pack that the troops in Vietnam received.
663	Another Slayton surprise was a gift of three miniature bottles of brandy, that Borman ordered the crew to leave alone until after they landed.
663	They remained unopened, even years after the flight.
663	There were also small presents to the crew from their wives.
663	The next day, at about 124 hours into the mission, the sixth and final TV transmission showed the mission's best video images of the earth, in a short four minute broadcast.
663	After two uneventful days the crew prepared for re-entry.
663	The computer would control the re-entry and all the crew had to do was put the spacecraft in the correct attitude, blunt end forward.
663	If the computer broke down, Borman would take over.
663	Once the Command Module was separated from the Service Module, the astronauts were committed to re-entry.
663	Six minutes before they hit the top of the atmosphere, the crew saw the Moon rising above the Earth's horizon, just as had been predicted by the trajectory specialists.
663	As they hit the thin outer atmosphere they noticed it was becoming hazy outside as glowing plasma formed around the spacecraft.
663	The spacecraft started slowing down and the deceleration peaked at 6 g (59 m/s2).
663	With the computer controlling the descent by changing the attitude of the spacecraft, Apollo 8 rose briefly like a skipping stone before descending to the ocean.
663	At 30000 ft the drogue parachute stabilized the spacecraft and was followed at 10000 ft by the three main parachutes.
663	The spacecraft splashdown position was officially reported as  in the North Pacific Ocean south of Hawaii.
663	When it hit the water, the parachutes dragged the spacecraft over and left it upside down, in what was termed Stable 2 position.
663	About six minutes later the Command Module was righted into its normal apex-up splashdown orientation by the inflatable bag uprighting system.
663	As they were buffeted by a 10 ft swell, Borman was sick, waiting for the three flotation balloons to right the spacecraft.
663	It was 43 minutes after splashdown before the first frogman from the USS Yorktown arrived, as the spacecraft had landed before sunrise.
663	Forty-five minutes later, the crew was safe on the deck of the aircraft carrier.
663	Historical importance Apollo 8 came at the end of 1968, a year that had seen much upheaval in the United States and most of the world.
663	Even though the year saw political assassinations, political unrest in the streets of Europe and America, and the Prague Spring,  TIME magazine chose the crew of Apollo 8 as their Men of the Year for 1968, recognizing them as the people who most influenced events in the preceding year.
663	They had been the first people ever to leave the gravitational influence of the Earth and orbit another celestial body.
663	They had survived a mission that even the crew themselves had rated as only having a fifty-fifty chance of fully succeeding.
663	The effect of Apollo 8 can be summed up by a telegram from a stranger, received by Borman after the mission, that simply stated, "Thank you Apollo 8.
663	You saved 1968."
663	One of the most famous aspects of the flight was the Earthrise picture that was taken as they came around for their fourth orbit of the Moon.
663	This , Connecticuwas the first time that humans had taken such a picture whilst actually behind the camera, and it has been credited with a role in inspiring the first Earth Day in 1970.
663	It was selected as the first of Life magazine's 'hundred photos that changed the world'.
663	Apollo 11 astronaut Michael Collins said, "Eight's momentous historic significance was foremost;" while many space historians, such as Robert K Poole, see Apollo 8 as the most historically significant of all the Apollo missions.
663	The mission was the most widely covered by the media since the first American orbital flight, Mercury-Atlas 6 by John Glenn in 1962.
663	There were 1200 journalists covering the mission, with the BBC coverage being broadcast in 54 countries in 15 different languages.
663	The Soviet newspaper Pravda featured a quote from Boris Nikolaevich Petrov, Chairman of the Soviet Intercosmos program, who described the flight as an "outstanding achievement of American space sciences and technology".
663	It is estimated that a quarter of the people alive at the time saw—either live or delayed—the Christmas Eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the Moon.
663	The Apollo 8 broadcasts won an Emmy Award, the highest honor given by the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.
663	Atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair later caused controversy by bringing a lawsuit against NASA over the reading from Genesis.
663	O'Hair wished the courts to ban US astronauts—who were all government employees—from public prayer in space.
663	Though the case was rejected by the US Supreme Court for lack of jurisdiction, it caused NASA to be skittish about the issue of religion throughout the rest of the Apollo program.
663	Buzz Aldrin, on Apollo 11, self-communicated Presbyterian Communion on the surface of the Moon after landing; he refrained from mentioning this publicly for several years, and only obliquely referred to it at the time.
663	In 1969, the US Postal Service issued a postage stamp (Scott # 1371) commemorating the Apollo 8 flight around the Moon.
663	The stamp featured a detail of the famous photograph of the Earthrise over the Moon taken by Anders on Christmas Eve, and the words, "In the beginning God..."
663	Just 18 days after the crew's return to Earth, they were featured during the 1969 Super Bowl pre-game show reciting the Pledge of Allegiance prior to the National Anthem.
663	Spacecraft location The command module is now displayed at the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry, along with a collection of personal items from the flight donated by Lovell and the spacesuit worn by Frank Borman.
663	Jim Lovell's Apollo 8 spacesuit is on public display in the Visitor Center at NASA's Glenn Research Center.
663	Bill Anders' spacesuit is on display at the Science Museum in London, England.
663	In film Apollo 8's historic mission has been shown and referred to in several forms, both documentary and fiction.
663	The various television transmissions and 16 mm footage shot by the crew of Apollo 8 was compiled and released by NASA in the 1969 documentary, Debrief: Apollo 8, which was hosted by Burgess Meredith.
663	In addition, Spacecraft Films released, in 2003, a three-disc DVD set containing all of NASA's TV and 16mm film footage related to the mission including all TV transmissions from space, training and launch footage, and motion pictures taken in flight.
663	Portions of the Apollo 8 Mission can be seen in the 1989 documentary For All Mankind, which won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival for Outstanding Documentary.
663	The Apollo 8 mission was well covered in the British documentary: 'In the Shadow of the Moon'.
663	Portions of the Apollo 8 mission are dramatized in the miniseries From the Earth to the Moon episode "1968".
663	The S-IVB stage of Apollo 8 was also portrayed as the location of an alien device in the 1970 UFO episode "Conflict".

664	An astronaut or cosmonaut is a person trained by a human spaceflight program to command, pilot, or serve as a crew member of a spacecraft.
664	While generally reserved for professional space travelers, the terms are sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space, including scientists, politicians, journalists, and tourists.
664	Until 2002, astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments, either by the military, or by civilian space agencies.
664	With the sub-orbital flight of the privately funded SpaceShipOne in 2004, a new category of astronaut was created: the commercial astronaut.
664	Definition The criteria for what constitutes human spaceflight vary.
664	The Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) Sporting Code for astronautics recognizes only flights that exceed an altitude of 100 km.
664	In the United States, professional, military, and commercial astronauts who travel above an altitude of 50 mi are awarded astronaut wings.
664	As of June 20, 2011, a total of 654 people from 38 countries have reached 100 km or more in altitude, of which 520 reached low Earth orbit or beyond.
664	Of these, 24 people have traveled beyond Low Earth orbit, to either lunar or trans-lunar orbit or to the surface of the moon; three of the 24 did so twice: Jim Lovell, John Young and Eugene Cernan.
664	The three astronauts who have not reached low Earth orbit are spaceplane pilots Joe Walker, Mike Melvill, and Brian Binnie.
664	Under the U.S.
664	JuA.
664	Walker|Joe Walker]ne 20, 2011, 529 people qualify as having reached space, above 50 mi altitude.
664	Of eight X-15 pilots who exceeded 50 mi in altitude, only one exceeded 100 kilometers (about 62 miles).
664	Space travelers have spent over 30,400 man-days (83 man-years) in space, including over 100 astronaut-days of spacewalks.
664	As of 2008, the man with the longest cumulative time in space is Sergei K.
664	Krikalev, who has spent 803 days, 9 hours and 39 minutes, or 2.2 years, in space.
664	Peggy A.
664	Whitson holds the record for the most time in space by a woman, 377 days.
664	Terminology English In the United States, Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and many other English-speaking nations, a professional space traveler is called an astronaut.
664	The term derives from the Greek words ástron (ἄστρον), meaning "star", and nautes (ναύτης), meaning "sailor".
664	The first known use of the term "astronaut" in the modern sense was by Neil R.
664	Jones in his short story "The Death's Head Meteor" in 1930.
664	The word itself had been known earlier.
664	For example, in Percy Greg's 1880 book Across the Zodiac, "astronaut" referred to a spacecraft.
664	In Les Navigateurs de l'Infini (1925) of J.-H.
664	Rosny aîné, the word astronautique (astronautic) was used.
664	The word may have been inspired by "aeronaut", an older term for an air traveler first applied (in 1784) to balloonists.
664	An early use in a non-fiction publication is Eric Frank Russell's poem "The Astronaut" in the November 1934 Bulletin of the British Interplanetary Society.
664	The first known formal use of the term astronautics in the scientific community was the establishment of the annual International Astronautical Congress in 1950 and the subsequent founding of the International Astronautical Federation the following year.
664	NASA applies the term astronaut to any crew member aboard NASA spacecraft bound for Earth orbit or beyond.
664	NASA also uses the term as a title for those selected to join its Astronaut Corps.
664	The European Space Agency similarly uses the term astronaut for members of its Astronaut Corps.
664	Russian By convention, an astronaut employed by the Russian Federal Space Agency (or its Soviet predecessor) is called a cosmonaut in English texts.
664	The word is an anglicisation of the Russian word kosmonavt (), one who works in space outside the Earth's atmosphere, a space traveler, which derives from the Greek words kosmos (κόσμος), meaning "universe", and nautes (ναύτης), meaning "sailor".
664	The Soviet Air Force pilot Yuri Gagarin was the first cosmonaut—indeed the first person—in space.
664	Valentina Tereshkova, a Russian factory worker, was the first female in space, as well as arguably the first civilian to make it there (see below for a further discussion of civilians in space).
664	On March 14, 1995, Norman Thagard became the first American to ride to space on board a Russian launch vehicle, and thus became the first "American cosmonaut".
664	Chinese Official English-language texts issued by the government of the People's Republic of China use astronaut while texts in Russian use космонавт (cosmonaut).
664	In official Chinese-language texts, "yǔ háng yuán" (, "space navigating personnel") are used for astronaut and cosmonaut, and "háng tiān yuán" (, "space navigating personnel") is specially used for Chinese astronaut.
664	The phrase "tài kōng rén" (, "spaceman") is often used in Taiwan and Hong Kong.
664	The term taikonaut is used by some English-language news media organizations for professional space travelers from China.
664	The word has featured in the Longman and Oxford English dictionaries,  the latter of which describes it as "a hybrid of the Chinese term taikong (space) and the Greek naut (sailor)"; the term became more common in 2003 when China sent its first astronaut Yang Liwei into space aboard the Shenzhou 5 spacecraft.
664	This is the term used by Xinhua News Agency in the English version of the Chinese People's Daily since the advent of the Chinese space program.
664	The origin of the term is unclear; as early as May 1998, Chiew Lee Yih () from Malaysia, used it in newsgroups.
664	Other terms With the rise of space tourism, NASA and the Russian Federal Space Agency agreed to use the term "spaceflight participant" to distinguish those space travelers from professional astronauts on missions coordinated by those two agencies.
664	While no nation other than the Russian Federation (and previously the former Soviet Union), the United States, and China have launched a manned spacecraft, several other nations have sent people into space in cooperation with one of these countries.
664	Inspired partly by these missions, other synonyms for astronaut have entered occasional English usage.
664	For example, the term spationaut (French spelling: spationaute) is sometimes used to describe French space travelers, from the Latin word spatium for "space", and the Malay term angkasawan was used to describe participants in the Angkasawan program.
664	Space travel milestones The first human in space was Soviet Yuri Gagarin, who was launched on April 12, 1961 aboard Vostok 1 and orbited around the Earth for 108 minutes.
664	The first woman in space was Soviet Valentina Tereshkova, who launched on June 16, 1963 aboard Vostok 6 and orbited Earth for almost three days.
664	Alan Shepard became the first American and second person in space on May 5, 1961 on a 15-minute sub-orbital flight.
664	The first American woman in space was Sally Ride, during Space Shuttle Challenger's mission STS-7, on June 18, 1983.
664	In 1992 Mae Jemison became the first African American woman to travel in space aboard STS-47.
664	In 1984, Rakesh Sharma of India became the first Indian to fly in space when he boarded the Soyuz T-11.In 1997, Kalpana Chawla  became the first Indian woman to fly in space when she flew in Space shuttle Columbia.
664	Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov was the first person to conduct an extra-vehicular activity (EVA), (commonly called a "spacewalk"), on March 18, 1965, on the Soviet Union's Voshkhod 2 mission.
664	This was followed two and a half months later by astronaut Ed White who made the first American EVA on NASA's Gemini 4 mission.
664	The first manned mission to orbit the Moon, Apollo 8, included American William Anders who was born in Hong Kong, making him the first Asian-born astronaut in 1968.
664	In April 1985, Taylor Wang became the first ethnic Chinese person in space.
664	On 15 October 2003, Yang Liwei became China's first astronaut on the Shenzhou 5 spacecraft.
664	The Soviet Union, through its Intercosmos program, allowed people from other "socialist" (i.e.
664	Warsaw Pact and other Soviet-alowed people from other "socialismllied) countries to fly on its missions.
664	An example is Czechoslovak Vladimír Remek, the first cosmonaut from a country other than the Soviet Union or the United States, who flew to space in 1978 on a Soyuz-U rocket.
664	On July 23, 1980, Pham Tuan of Vietnam became the first Asian in space when he flew aboard Soyuz 37.
664	Also in 1980, Cuban Arnaldo Tamayo Méndez became the first person of Hispanic and black African descent to fly in space, and Guion Bluford became the first African American to fly into space.
664	The first person born in Africa to fly in space was Patrick Baudry, in 1985.
664	In 1985, Saudi Arabian Prince Sultan Bin Salman Bin AbdulAziz Al-Saud became the first Arab Muslim astronaut in space.
664	In 1988, Abdul Ahad Mohmand became the first Afghan to reach space, spending nine days aboard the Mir space station.
664	With the larger number of seats available on the Space Shuttle, the U.S.
664	In 1983, Ulf Merbold of West Germany became the first non-US citizen to fly in a US spacecraft.
664	In 1984, Marc Garneau became the first of 8 Canadian astronauts to fly in space (through 2010).
664	In 1985, Rodolfo Neri Vela became the first Mexican-born person in space.
664	In 1991, Helen Sharman became the first Briton to fly in space.
664	In 2002, Mark Shuttleworth became the first citizen of an African country to fly in space, as a paying spaceflight participant.
664	In 2003, Ilan Ramon became the first Israeli to fly in space, although he died during a re-entry accident.
664	Age milestones The youngest person to fly in space is Gherman Titov, who was 25 years old when he flew Vostok 2.
664	Titov was also the first person to suffer space sickness).
664	The oldest person who has flown in space is John Glenn, who was 77 when he flew on STS-95.
664	Duration and distance milestones The longest stay in space thus far has been 438 days, by Russian Valeri Polyakov.
664	As of 2006, the most spaceflights by an individual astronaut is seven, a record held by both Jerry L.
664	Ross and Franklin Chang-Diaz.
664	The farthest distance from Earth an astronaut has traveled was 401056 km, when Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred Haise went around the Moon during the Apollo 13 emergency.
664	Civilian and non-government milestones Depending on the exact definition of 'civilian', the first civilian in space was either Valentina Tereshkova aboard Vostok 6 (she also became the first woman in space on that mission) or Joseph Albert Walker on X-15 Flight 90 a month later.
664	Tereshkova was only honorarily inducted into the USSR's Air Force, which had no female pilots whatsoever at that time.
664	Joe Walker had joined the US Army Air Force but was not a member during his flight.
664	The first people in space who had never been a member of any country's armed forces were both Konstantin Feoktistov and Boris Yegorov aboard Voskhod 1.
664	The first non-governmental space traveler was Byron K.
664	Lichtenberg,  a researcher from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who flew on STS-9 in 1983.
664	In December 1990, Toyohiro Akiyama became the first paying space traveler as a reporter for Tokyo Broadcasting System, a visit to Mir as part of an estimated $12 million (USD) deal with a Japanese TV station, although at the time, the term used to refer to Akiyama was "Research Cosmonaut".
664	Akiyama suffered severe space sickness during his mission, which affected his productivity.
664	The first self-funded space tourist was Dennis Tito on board the Russian spacecraft  Soyuz TM-3 on 28 April 2001.
664	Self-funded travelers The first person to fly on an entirely privately funded mission was Mike Melvill, piloting SpaceShipOne flight 15P on a suborbital journey, although he was a test pilot employed by Scaled Composites and not an actual paying space tourist.
664	Seven others have paid to fly into space: #Dennis Tito (American): April 28 – May 6, 2001 (ISS) #Mark Shuttleworth (South African): April 25 – May 5, 2002 (ISS) #Gregory Olsen (American): October 1–11, 2005 (ISS) #Anousheh Ansari (Iranian / American): September 18–29, 2006 (ISS) #Charles Simonyi (Hungarian / American): April 7–21, 2007 (ISS), March 26 – April 8, 2009 (ISS) #Richard Garriott (American): October 12–24, 2008 (ISS) #Guy Laliberté (Canadian): September 30, 2009 – October 11, 2009 (ISS) Training   The first NASA astronauts were selected for training in 1959.
664	Early in the space program, military jet test piloting and engineering training were often cited as prerequisites for selection as an astronaut at NASA, although neither John Glenn nor Scott Carpenter (of the Mercury Seven) had any university degree, in engineering or any other discipline at the time of their selection.
664	Selection was initially limited to military pilots.
664	The earliest astronauts for both America and the USSR tended to be jet fighter pilots, and were often test pilots.
664	Once selected, NASA astronauts go through twenty months of training in a variety of areas, including training for extra-vehicular activity in a facility such as NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory.
664	Astronauts-in-training may also experience short periods of weightlessness in aircraft called the "vomit comet", the nickname given to a pair of modified KC-135s (retired in 2000 and 2004 respectively, and replaced in 2005 with a C-9) which perform parabolic flights.
664	Astronauts are also required to accumulate a number of flight hours in high-performance jet aircraft.
664	This is mostly done in T-38 jet aircraft out of Ellington Field, due to its proximity to the Johnson Space Center.
664	Ellington Field is also where the Shuttle Training Aircraft is maintained and developed, although most flights of the aircraft are done out of Edwards Air Force Base.
664	NASA candidacy requirements * Be citizens of the United States.

664	Distant vigical procedures of the eye, PRK (Photorefractive keratectomy) and LASIK, are now allowed, providing at least 1 year has passed since the date of the procedure with no permanent adverse aftereffects.
664	For those applicants under final consideration, an operative report on the surgical procedure will be requested.
664	Mission Specialist * A bachelor's degree in engineering, biological science, physical science or mathematics, as well as at least three years of related professional experience (graduate work or studies) and an advanced degree, such as a master's degree (one to three years) or a doctoral degree (three years or more).
664	Applicant's height must be between 58.5 and 76 inches Mission Specialist Educator * Applicants must have a bachelor's degree with teaching experience, including work at the kindergarten through twelfth grade level.
664	An advanced degree, such as a master's degree or a doctoral degree, is not required, but is strongly desired.
664	Mission Specialist Educators, or "Educator Astronauts", were first selected in 2004, and as of 2007, there are three NASA Educator astronauts: Joseph M.
664	Acaba, Richard R.
664	Arnold, and Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger.
664	Barbara Morgan, selected as back-up teacher to Christa McAuliffe in 1985, is considered to be the first Educator astronaut by the media, but she trained as a mission specialist.
664	The Educator Astronaut program is a successor to the Teacher in Space program from the 1980s.
664	Health risks of space travel Astronauts are susceptible to a variety of health risks including decompression sickness, barotrauma, immunodeficiencies, loss of bone and muscle, loss of eyesight, orthostatic intolerance due to volume loss, sleep disturbances, and radiation injury.
664	A variety of large scale medical studies are being conducted in space via the National Space and Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI) to address these issues.
664	Prominent among these is the Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity Study in which astronauts (including former ISS commanders Leroy Chiao and Gennady Padalka) perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts to diagnose and potentially treat hundreds of medical conditions in space.
664	This study's techniques are now being applied to cover professional and Olympic sports injuries as well as ultrasound performed by non-expert operators in medical and high school students.
664	It is anticipated that remote guided ultrasound will have application on Earth in emergency and rural care situations, where access to a trained physician is often rare.
664	On December 31, 2012, a NASA-supported study reported that manned spaceflight may harm the brain and accelerate the onset of Alzheimer's disease.
664	Insignia In Russia, cosmonauts are awarded Pilot-Cosmonaut of the Russian Federation upon completion of their missions, often accompanied with the award of Hero of the Russian Federation.
664	This follows the practice established in the Soviet Union.
664	At NASA, those who complete astronaut candidate training receive a silver lapel pin.
664	Once they have flown in space, they receive a gold pin.
664	U.S.
664	Astronaut Badge, after participation on a spaceflight.
664	The United States Air Force also presents an Astronaut Badge to its pilots who exceed 50 mi in altitude.
664	Deaths Eighteen astronauts (fourteen men and four women) have lost their lives during four space flights.
664	By nationality, thirteen were American (including one of Indian origin), four were Russian (Soviet Union), and one was Israeli.
664	Eleven people (all men) have lost their lives training for spaceflight: eight Americans and three Russians.
664	Six of these were in crashes of training jet aircraft, one drowned during water recovery training, and four were due to fires in pure oxygen environments.
664	The Space Mirror Memorial, which stands on the grounds of the John F.
664	Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, commemorates the lives of the men and women who have died during spaceflight and during training in the space programs of the United States.
664	In addition to twenty NASA career astronauts, the memorial includes the names of a U.S.
664	Air Force X-15 test pilot, a U.S.
664	Air Force officer who died while training for a then-classified military space program, and a civilian spaceflight participant.
665	A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People From Being a Burden to Their Parents or Country, and for Making Them Beneficial to the Public, commonly referred to as A Modest Proposal, is a Juvenalian satirical essay written and published anonymously by Jonathan Swift in 1729.
665	Swift suggests that the impoverished Irish might ease their economic troubles by selling their children as food for rich gentlemen and ladies.
665	This satirical hyperbole mocks heartless attitudes towards the poor, as well as Irish policy in general.
665	In English writing, the phrase "a modest proposal" is now conventionally an allusion to this style of straight-faced satire.
665	Details Swift goes to great lengths to support his argument, including a list of possible preparation styles for the children, and calculations showing the financial benefits of his suggestion.
665	He uses methods of argument throughout his essay which lampoon then-influential William Petty and the social engineering popular among followers of Francis Bacon.
665	These lampoons include appealing to the authority of "a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London" and "the famous Psalmanazar, a native of the island Formosa" (who had already confessed to not being from Formosa in 1706).
665	This essay is widely held to be one of the greatest examples of sustained irony in the history of the English language.
665	Much of its shock value derives from the fact that the first portion of the essay describes the plight of starving beggars in Ireland, so that the reader is unprepared for the surprise of Swift's solution when he states, "A young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee, or a ra or boilgout."
665	Readers unacquainted with its reputation as a satirical work often do not immediately realize that Swift was not seriously proposing cannibalism and infanticide, nor would readers unfamiliar with the satires of Horace and Juvenal recognize that Swift's essay follows the rules and structure of Latin satires.
665	The satirical element of the pamphlet is often only understood after the reader notes the allusions made by Swift to the attitudes of landlords, such as the following: "I grant this food may be somewhat dear, and therefore very proper for Landlords, who as they have already devoured most of the Parents, seem to have the best Title to the Children."
665	Swift extends the conceit to get in a few jibes at England’s mistreatment of Ireland, noting that "For this kind of commodity will not bear exportation, and flesh being of too tender a consistence, to admit a long continuance in salt, although perhaps I could name a country, which would be glad to eat up our whole nation without it."
665	In the tradition of Roman satire, Swift introduces the reforms he is actually suggesting by paralipsis: Population solutions George Wittkowsky argued that Swift’s main target in A Modest Proposal was not the conditions in Ireland, but rather the can-do spirit of the times that led people to devise a number of illogical schemes that would purportedly solve social and economic ills.
665	Swift was especially insulted by projects that tried to fix population and labor issues with a simple cure-all solution.
665	A memorable example of these sorts of schemes "involved the idea of running the poor through a joint-stock company".
665	In response, Swift’s Modest Proposal was "a burlesque of projects concerning the poor", that were in vogue during the early 18th century.
665	A Modest Proposal also targets the calculating way people perceived the poor in designing their projects.
665	The pamphlet targets reformers who "regard people as commodities".
665	In the piece, Swift adopts the "technique of a political arithmetician" to show the utter ridiculousness of trying to prove any proposal with dispassionate statistics.
665	Critics differ about Swift’s intentions in using this faux-mathematical philosophy.
665	Edmund Wilson argues that statistically "the logic of the 'Modest proposal' can be compared with defense of crime (arrogated to Marx) in which he argues that crime takes care of the superfluous population".
665	Wittkowsky counters that Swift's satiric use of statistical analysis is an effort to enhance his satire that "springs from a spirit of bitter mockery, not from the delight in calculations for their own sake".
665	Rhetoric Charles K.
665	Smith argues that Swift’s rhetorical style persuades the reader to detest the speaker and pity the Irish.
665	Swift’s specific strategy is twofold, using a "trap" to create sympathy for the Irish and a dislike of the narrator who, in the span of one sentence, "details vividly and with rhetorical emphasis the grinding poverty" but feels emotion solely for members of his own class.
665	Swift’s use of gripping details of poverty and his narrator’s cool approach towards them create "two opposing points of view" that "alienate the reader, perhaps unconsciously, from a narrator who can view with 'melancholy' detachment a subject that Swift has directed us, rhetorically, to see in a much less detached way."
665	Swift has his proposer further degrade the Irish by using language ordinarily reserved for animals.
665	Lewis argues that the speaker uses "the vocabulary of animal husbandry" to describe the Irish.
665	Once the children have been commodified, Swift’s rhetoric can easily turn "people into animals, then meat, and from meat, logically, into tonnage worth a price per pound".
665	Swift uses the proposer’s serious tone to highlight the absurdity of his proposal.
665	In making his argument, the speaker uses the conventional, text book approved order of argument from Swift’s time (which was derived from the Latin rhetorician Quintilian).
665	The contrast between the "careful control against the almost inconceivable perversion of his scheme" and "the ridiculousness of the proposal" create a situation in which the reader has "to consider just what perverted values and assumptions would allow such a diligent, thoughtful, and conventional man to propose so perverse a plan".
665	Influences There has been some scholarship about what other writings influenced Swift to write A Modest Proposal.
665	Tertullian’s Apology James Johnson argued that A Modest Proposal was largely influenced and inspired by Tertullian’s Apology: a satirical attack against early Roman persecution of Christianity.
665	James William Johnson believes that Swift saw major similarities between the two situations.
665	Johnson notes Swift’s obvious affinity for Tertullian and the bold stylistic and structural similarities between the works A Modest Proposal and Apology.
665	In structure, Johnson points out the same central theme, that of cannibalism and the eating of babies astructure, Johnson points out the same central th well as the same final argument, that "human depravity is such that men will attempt to justify their own cruelty by accusing their victims of being lower than human."
665	Stylistically, Swift and Tertullian share the same command of sarcasm and language.
665	In agreement with Johnson, Donald C.
665	Baker points out the similarity between both authors' tones and use of irony.
665	Baker notes the uncanny way that both authors imply an ironic "justification by ownership" over the subject of sacrificing children—Tertullian while attacking pagan parents, and Swift while attacking the English mistreatment of the Irish poor.
665	Defoe's The Generous Projector It has also been argued that A Modest Proposal was, at least in part, a response to the 1728 essay The Generous Projector or, A Friendly Proposal to Prevent Murder and Other Enormous Abuses, By Erecting an Hospital for Foundlings and Bastard Children by Swift's rival Daniel Defoe.
665	Economic themes Robert Phiddian's article "Have you eaten yet?
665	The Reader in A Modest Proposal" focuses on two aspects of A Modest Proposal: the voice of Swift and the voice of the Proposer.
665	Phiddian stresses that a reader of the pamphlet must learn to distinguish between the satiric voice of Jonathan Swift and the apparent economic projections of the Proposer.
665	He reminds readers that "there is a gap between the narrator’s meaning and the text’s, and that a moral-political argument is being carried out by means of parody".
665	While Swift’s proposal is obviously not a serious economic proposal, George Wittkowsky, author of "Swift’s Modest Proposal: The Biography of an Early Georgian Pamphlet", argues that to understand the piece fully, it is important to understand the economics of Swift’s time.
665	Wittowsky argues that not enough critics have taken the time to focus directly on the mercantilism and theories of labor in 18th century England.
665	"[I]f one regards the Modest Proposal simply as a criticism of condition, about all one can say is that conditions were bad and that Swift's irony brilliantly underscored this fact".
665	"People are the riches of a nation" At the start of a new industrial age in the 18th century, it was believed that "people are the riches of the nation", and there was a general faith in an economy that paid its workers low wages because high wages meant workers would work less.
665	Furthermore, "in the mercantilist view no child was too young to go into industry".
665	In those times, the "somewhat more humane attitudes of an earlier day had all but disappeared and the laborer had come to be regarded as a commodity".
665	Louis A.
665	Landa presents Swift’s A Modest Proposal as a critique of the popular and unjustified maxim of mercantilism in the 18th century that "people are the riches of a nation".

665	Notes
666	The alkali metals are a group in the periodic table consisting of the chemical elements lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs), and francium (Fr).
666	This group lies in the s-block of the periodic table as all alkali metals have their outermost electron in an s-orbital.
666	The alkali metals provide the best example of group trends in properties in the periodic table, with elements exhibiting well-characterized homologous behaviour.
666	The alkali metals have very similar properties: they are all shiny, soft, highly reactive metals at standard temperature and pressure and readily lose their outermost electron to form cations with charge +1.
666	They can all be cut easily with a knife due to their softness, exposing a shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation.
666	Because of their high reactivity, they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air, and are found naturally only in salts and never as the free element.
666	In the modern IUPAC nomenclature, the alkali metals comprise the group 1 elements, excluding hydrogen (H), which is nominally a group 1 element but not normally considered to be an alkali metal as it rarely exhibits behaviour comparable to that of the alkali metals.
666	All the alkali metals react with water, with the heavier alkali metals reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones.
666	All the discovered alkali metals occur in nature: in order of abundance, sodium is the most abundant, followed by potassium, lithium, rubidium, caesium, and finally francium, which is very rare due to its extremely high radioactivity and thus occurs only in traces due to its presence in natural decay chains.
666	Experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of ununennium (Uue), which is likely to be the next member of the group, but they have all met with failure.
666	However, ununennium may not be an alkali metal due to relativistic effects, which are predicted to have a large influence on the chemical properties of superheavy elements; even if it does turn out to be an alkali metal, it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues.
666	Most alkali metals have many different applications.
666	Two of the most well-known applications of the pure elements are rubidium and caesium atomic clocks, of which caesium atomic clocks are the most accurate and precise representation of time.
666	A common application of the compounds of sodium is the sodium-vapour lamp, which emits very efficient light.
666	Table salt, or sodium chloride, has been used since antiquity.
666	Sodium and potassium are also essential elements, having major biological roles as electrolytes, and although the other alkali metals are not essential, they also have various effects on the body, both beneficial and harmful.
666	Characteristics Chemical Like other groups, the known members of this family show patterns in its electronic configuration, especially the outermost shells, resulting in trends in chemical behavior: Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the group.
666	The chemistry of francium is not well established due to its extreme radioactivity; thus, the presentation of its properties here is limited.
666	All the alkali metals are highly reactive and are never found in elemental forms in nature.
666	Because of this, they are usually stored in mineral oil or kerosene (paraffin oil).
666	They react aggressively with the halogens to form the alkali metal halides, which are white ionic crystalline compounds that are all soluble in water except lithium fluoride (LiF).
666	The alkali metals also react with water to form strongly alkaline hydroxides and thus should be handled with great care.
666	The heavier alkali metals react more vigorously than the lighter ones; for example, when dropped into water, caesium produces a larger explosion than potassium.
666	The alkali metals have the lowest first ionisation energies in their respective periods of the periodic table because of their low effective nuclear charge and the ability to attain a noble gas configuration by losing just one electron.
666	The second ionisation energy of all of the alkali metals is very high as it is in a full shell that is also closer to the nucleus; thus, they almost always lose a single electron, forming cations.
666	The alkalides are an exception: they are unstable compounds which contain alkali metals in a −1 oxidation state, which is very unusual as before the discovery of the alkalides, the alkali metals were not expected to be able to form anions and were thought to be able to appear in salts only as cations.
666	The alkalide anions have filled s-subshells, which gives them mots only as cations.re stability and allows them to exist.
666	All the stable alkali metals except lithium are known to be able to form alkalides, and the alkalides have much theoretical interest due to their unusual stoichiometry and low ionisation potentials.
666	Alkalides are chemically similar to the electrides, which are salts with trapped electrons acting as anions.
666	A particularly striking example of an alkalide is "inverse sodium hydride", H+Na−, as opposed to the usual sodium hydride, Na+H−: it is unstable in isolation, due to its high energy resulting from the displacement of two electrons from hydrogen to sodium, although several derivatives are predicted to be metastable or stable.
666	The chemistry of lithium shows several differences from that of the rest of the group as the small Li+ cation polarises anions and gives its compounds a more covalent character.
666	Lithium and magnesium have a diagonal relationship: because of this, lithium has some similarities to magnesium.
666	For example, lithium forms a stable nitride, a property common among all the alkaline earth metals (magnesium's group) but unique among the alkali metals.
666	In addition, among their respective groups, only lithium and magnesium form covalent organometallic compounds (e.g.
666	LiMe and MgMe2).
666	Lithium fluoride is the only alkali metal halide that is not soluble in water, and lithium hydroxide is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent.
666	Francium is also predicted show some differences due to its high atomic weight, causing its electrons to travel at considerable fractions of the speed of light and thus making relativistic effects more prominent.
666	In contrast to the trend of decreasing electronegativities and ionisation energies of the alkali metals, francium's electronegativity and ionisation energy are predicted to be higher than caesium's due to the relativistic stabilisation of the 7s electrons; also, its atomic radius is expected to be abnormally low.
666	Compounds and reactions Reaction with water (alkali metal hydroxides) All the alkali metals react vigorously or explosively with cold water, producing an aqueous solution of the strongly basic alkali metal hydroxide and releasing hydrogen gas.
666	This reaction becomes more vigorous going down the group: lithium reacts steadily with effervescence, but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers.
666	When an alkali metal is dropped into water, it produces an explosion, of which there are two separate stages.
666	The metal reacts with the water first, breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing hydrogen gas; this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals.
666	Second, the heat generated by the first part of the reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas, causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air.
666	This secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water, lake or other body of water, not the initial reaction of the metal with water (which tends to happen mostly under water).
666	The chemical reaction of the alkali metals with water is: 2 M (s) + 2 H2O (l) → 2 MOH (aq) + H2 (g) (where M represents an alkali metal) Reaction with nitrogen (alkali metal nitrides) Lithium, the lightest of the alkali metals, is the only alkali metal which reacts with nitrogen at standard conditions, and its nitride is the only stable alkali metal nitride.
666	Nitrogen is an unreactive gas because breaking the strong triple bond in the dinitrogen molecule (N2) requires a lot of energy.
666	The formation of an alkali metal nitride would consume the ionisation energy of the alkali metal (forming M+ ions), the energy required to break the triple bond in N2 and the formation of N3− ions, and all the energy released from the formation of an alkali metal nitride is from the lattice energy of the alkali metal nitride.
666	The lattice energy is maximised with small, highly charged ions; the alkali metals do not form highly charged ions, only forming ions with a charge of +1, so only lithium, the smallest alkali metal, can release enough lattice energy to make the reaction with nitrogen exothermic, forming lithium nitride.
666	The reactions of the other alkali metals with nitrogen would not release enough lattice energy and would thus be endothermic, so they do not form nitrides at standard conditions.
666	Sodium nitride (Na3N) and potassium nitride (K3N), while existing, are extremely unstable, being prone to decomposing back into their constituent elements, and cannot be produced by reacting the elements with each other at standard conditions.) The chemical reaction of lithium with nitrogen is: 6 Li (s) + N2 (g) → 2 Li3N (s) Reaction with oxygen (alkali metal oxides) All the alkali metals react vigorously with oxygen at standard conditions.
666	They form various types of oxides, such as simple oxides (containing the O2− ion), peroxides (containing the  ion, where there is a single bond between the two oxygen atoms), superoxides (containing the  ion), and many others.
666	Lithium burns in air to form lithium oxide, but sodium reacts with oxygen to form a mixture of sodium oxide and sodium peroxide.
666	Potassium forms a mixture of potassium peroxide and potassium superoxide, while rubidium and caesium form the superoxide exclusively.
666	Their reactivity increases going down the group: while lithium, sodium and potassium merely burn in air, rubidium and caesium are pyrophoric (spontaneously catch fire in air).
666	The smaller alkali metals tend to polarise the more complex anions (the peroxide and superoxide) due to their small size.
666	This attracts the electrons in the more complex anions towards one of its constituent oxygen atoms, forming an oxide ion and an oxygen atom.
666	This causes lithium to form the oxide exclusively on reaction with oxygen at room temperature.
666	This effect becomes drastically weaker for the larger sodium and potassium, allowing them to form the less stable peroxides.
666	Rubidium and caesium, at the bottom of the group, are so large that even the least stable superoxides can form.
666	Because the superoxide releases the most energy when formed, the superoxide is preferentially formed for the larger alkali metals where the more complex anions are not polarised.
666	The oxides and peroxides for these alkali metals do exist, but do not form upon direct reaction of the metal with oxygen at standard conditions.) The chemical reaction of the alkali metals with oxygen that forms the oxide is: 4 M (s) + O2 (g) → 2 M2O (s) (where M represents an alkali metal) The chemical reaction that forms the peroxide is: 2 M (s) + O2 (g) → M2O2 (s) (where M represents an alkali metal) The chemical reaction that forms the superoxide is: M (s) + O2 (g) → MO2 (s) (where M represents an alkali metal) Rubidium and caesium can form even more complicated oxides than the superoxides.
666	Rubidium can form Rb6O and Rb9O2 upon oxidation in air, while caesium forms an immense variety of oxides, such as the ozonide CsO3 and several brightly coloured suboxides, such as , , ,  (dark-green), CsO, , as well as .
666	The latter may be heated under vacuum to generate .
666	Reaction with the halogens (alkali metal halides) The alkali metals are among the most electropositive elements on the periodic table and thus tend to bond ionically to the most electronegative elements on the periodic table, the halogens, forming salts known as the alkali metal halides.
666	This includes sodium chloride, otherwise known as common salt.
666	The reactivity becomes higher from lithium to caesium and drops from fluorine to iodine.
666	All of the alkali metal halides have the formula MX where M is an alkali metal and X is a halogen.
666	They are all white ionic crystalline solids.
666	All the alkali metal halides are soluble in water except for lithium fluoride (LiF), which is insoluble in water due to its very high lattice enthalpy.
666	The high lattice enthalpy of lithium fluoride is due to the small sizes of the Li+ and F− ions, causing the electrostatic interactions between them to be strong.
666	The chemical reaction of the alkali metals with the halogens is: 2 M + X2 → 2 MX (where M represents an alkali metal and X represents a halogen) Physical The alkali metals are all silver-coloured except for caesium, which has a golden tint.
666	All are soft and have low densities, melting points, and boiling points.
666	The table below is a summary of the key physical and atomic properties of the alkali metals.
666	Data marked with question marks are either uncertain or are estimations partially based on periodic trends rather than observations.
666	Nuclear All the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers; hence, their isotopes must be either odd-odd (both proton and neutron number are odd) or odd-even (proton number is odd, but neutron number is even).
666	Odd-odd nuclei have even mass numbers, while odd-even nuclei have odd mass numbers.
666	Odd-odd primordial nuclides are rare because most odd-odd nuclei are highly unstable with respect to beta decay, because the decay products are even-even, and are therefore more strongly bound, due to nuclear pairing effects.
666	Due to the great rarity of odd-odd nuclei, almost all the primordial isotopes of the alkali metals are odd-even (the exceptions being the light stable isotope lithium-6 and the long-lived radioisotope potassium-40).
666	For a given odd mass number, there can be only a single beta-stable nuclide, since there is not a difference in binding energy between even-odd and odd-even comparable to that between even-even and odd-odd, leaving other nuclides of the same mass number (isobars) free to beta decay toward the lowest-mass nuclide.
666	An effect of the instability of an odd number of either type of nucleons is that odd-numbered elements, such as the alkali metals, tend to have fewer stable isotopes than even-numbered elements.
666	Of the 26 monoisotopic elements that have only a single stable isotope, all but one have an odd atomic number and all but one also have an even number of neutrons.
666	Beryllium is the single exception to both rules, due to its low atomic number.
666	All of the alkali metals except lithium and caesium have at least one naturally occurring radioisotope: sodium-22 and sodium-24 are trace radioisotopes produced cosmogenically, potassium-40 and rubidium-87 have very long half-lives and thus occur naturally, and all isotopes of francium are radioactive.
666	Caesium was also thought to be radioactive in the early 20th century, although it has no naturally occurring radioisotopes.
666	Francium had not been discovered yet at that time.) The natural radioisotope of potassium, potassium-40, makes up about 0.012% of natural potassium, and thus natural potassium is weakly radioactive.
666	This natural radioactivity became a basis for a mistaken claim of the discovery for element 87 (the next alkali metal after caesium) in 1925.
666	Caesium-137, with a half-life of 30.17 years, is one of the two principal medium-lived fission products, along with strontium-90, which are responsible for most of the radioactivity of spent nuclear fuel after several years of cooling, up to several hundred years after use.
666	It constitutes most of the radioactivity still left from the Chernobyl accident.
666	Cs undergoes high-energy beta decay and eventually becomes stable barium-137.
666	It is a strong emitter of gamma radiation.
666	Cs has a very low rate of neutron capture and cannot be feasibly disposed of in this way, but must be allowed to decay.
666	Cs has been used as a tracer in hydrologic studies, analogous to the use of 3H.
666	Small amounts of caesium-134 and ttp://www.bt.cdc.gov/radiacaesium-137 were released into the environment during nearly all nuclear weapon tests and some nuclear accidents, most notably the Goiânia accident and the Chernobyl disaster.
666	As of 2005, caesium-137 is the principal source of radiation in the zone of alienation around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.
666	Periodic trends The alkali metals are more similar to each other than the elements in any other group are to each other.
666	For instance, when moving down the table, all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius, decreasing electronegativity, increasing reactivity, and decreasing melting and boiling points.
666	In general, their densities increase when moving down the table, with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium.
666	Atomic and ionic radii The atomic radii of the alkali metals increase going down the group.
666	Because of the shielding effect, when an atom has more than one electron shell, each electron feels electric repulsion from the other electrons as well as electric attraction from the nucleus.
666	In the alkali metals, the outermost electron only feels a net charge of +1, as some of the nuclear charge (which is equal to the atomic number) is cancelled by the inner electrons; the number of inner electrons of an alkali metal is always one less than the nuclear charge.
666	Therefore, the only factor which affects the atomic radius of the alkali metals is the number of electron shells.
666	Since this number increases down the group, the atomic radius must also increase down the group.
666	The ionic radii of the alkali metals are much smaller than their atomic radii.
666	This is because the outermost electron of the alkali metals is in a different electron shell than the inner electrons, and thus when it is removed the resulting atom has one fewer electron shell and is smaller.
666	Additionally, the effective nuclear charge has increased, and thus the electrons are attracted more strongly towards the nucleus and the ionic radius decreases.
666	First ionisation energy The first ionisation energy of an element or molecule is the energy required to move the most loosely held electron from one mole of gaseous atoms of the element or molecules to form one mole of gaseous ions with electric charge +1.
666	The factors affecting the first ionisation energy are the nuclear charge, the amount of shielding by the inner electrons and the distance from the most loosely held electron from the nucleus, which is always an outer electron in main group elements.
666	The first two factors change the effective nuclear charge the most loosely held electron feels.
666	Since the outermost electron of alkali metals always feel the same effective nuclear charge (+1), the only factor which affects the first ionisation energy is the distance from the outermost electron to the nucleus.
666	Since this distance increases down the gis the distanroup, the outermost electron feels less attraction from the nucleus and thus the first ionisation energy decreases.
666	This trend is broken in francium due to the relativistic stabilization and contraction of the 7s orbital, bringing francium's valence electron closer to the nucleus than would be expected from non-relativistic calculations.
666	This makes francium's outermost electron feel more attraction from the nucleus, increasing its first ionisation energy slightly beyond that of caesium.) The second ionisation energy of the alkali metals is much higher than the first as the second-most loosely held electron is part of a fully filled electron shell and is thus difficult to remove.
666	Reactivity The reactivities of the alkali metals increase going down the group.
666	This is the result of a combination of two factors: the first ionisation energies and atomisation energies of the alkali metals.
666	Because the first ionisation energy of the alkali metals decreases down the group, it is easier for the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in chemical reactions, thus increasing reactivity down the group.
666	The atomisation energy measures the strength of the metallic bond of an element, which falls down the group as the atoms increase in radius and thus the metallic bond must increase in length, making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction of the nuclei of the heavier alkali metals.
666	Adding the atomisation and first ionisation energies gives a quantity closely related to (but not equal to) the activation energy of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance.
666	This quantity decreases going down the group, and so does the activation energy; thus, chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity increases down the group.
666	Electronegativity Electronegativity is a chemical property that describes the  tendency of an atom or a functional group to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself.
666	If the bond between sodium and chlorine in sodium chloride were covalent, the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is +7 in chlorine but is only +1 in sodium.
666	The electron pair is attracted so close to the chlorine atom that they are practically transferred to the chlorine atom (an ionic bond).
666	However, if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom, the electrons will not be attracted as close to the chlorine atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller, making the electron pair more strongly attracted to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium.
666	Hence, the larger alkali metal atoms (further down the group) will be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them.
666	Because of the higher electronegativity of lithium, some of its compounds have a more covalent character.
666	For example, lithium iodide (LiI) will dissolve in organic solvents, a property of most covalent compounds.
666	Lithium fluoride (LiF) is the only alkali halide that is not soluble in water, and lithium hydroxide (LiOH) is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent.
666	Melting and boiling points The melting point of a substance is the point where it changes state from solid to liquid while the boiling point of a substance (in liquid state) is the point where the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the environmental pressure surrounding the liquid and all the liquid changes state to gas.
666	As a metal is heated to its melting point, the metallic bonds keeping the atoms in place weaken so that the atoms can move around, and the metallic bonds eventually break completely at the metal's boiling point.
666	Therefore, the falling melting and boiling points of the alkali metals indicate that the strength of the metallic bonds of the alkali metals decreases down the group.
666	This is because metal atoms are held together by the electromagnetic attraction from the positive ions to the delocalised electrons.
666	As the atoms increase in size going down the group (because their atomic radius increases), the nuclei of the ions move further away from the delocalised electrons and hence the metallic bond becomes weaker so that the metal can more easily melt and boil, thus lowering the melting and boiling points.
666	The increased nuclear charge is not a relevant factor due to the shielding effect.) Density The alkali metals all have the same crystal structure (body-centred cubic) and thus the only relevant factors are the number of atoms that can fit into a certain volume and the mass of one of the atoms, since density is defined as mass per unit volume.
666	The first factor depends on the volume of the atom and thus the atomic radius, which increases going down the group; thus, the volume of an alkali metal atom increases going down the group.
666	The mass of an alkali metal atom also increases going down the group.
666	Thus, the trend for the densities of the alkali metals depends on their atomic weights and atomic radii; if figures for these two factors are known, the ratios between the densities of the alkali metals can then be calculated.
666	The resultant trend is that the densities of the alkali metals increase down the table, with an exception at potassium.
666	Due to having the lowest atomic weight of all the elements in their period and having the largest atomic radius for their periods, the alkali metals are the least dense metals in the periodic table.
666	Lithium, sodium, and potassium are the only three metals in the periodic table that are less dense than water.
666	Extensions Although francium is the heaviest alkali metal that has been discovered, there has been some theoretical work predicting the physical and chemical characteristics of the hypothetical heavier alkali metals.
666	Being the first period 8 element, the undiscovered element ununennium (element 119) is predicted to be the next alkali metal after francium and behave much like their lighter congeners; however, it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties.
666	Its chemistry is predicted to be closer to that of potassium or rubidium instead of caesium or francium.
666	This is unusual as periodic trends, ignoring relativistic effects would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than caesium and francium.
666	This lowered reactivity is due to the relativistic stabilisation of ununennium's valence electron, increasing ununennium's first ionisation energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii; this effect is already seen for francium.
666	This assumes that ununennium will behave chemically as an alkali metal, which, although likely, may not be true due to relativistic effects.
666	The relativistic stabilisation of the 8s orbital also increases ununennium's electron affinity far beyond that of caesium and francium; indeed, ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it.
666	Relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the polarisability of ununennium.
666	On the other hand, ununennium is predicted to continue the trend of melting points decreasing going down the group, being expected to have a melting point between 0 °C and 30 °C.
666	The stabilisation of ununennium's valence electron and thus the contraction of the 8s orbital cause its atomic radius to be lowered to 240 pm, very close to that of rubidium (247 pm), so that the chemistry of ununennium in the +1 oxidation state should be more similar to the chemistry of rubidium than to that of francium.
666	On the other hand, the ionic radius of the Uue+ ion is predicted to be larger than that of Rb+, because the 7p orbitals are destabilised and are thus larger than the p-orbitals of the lower shells.
666	Ununennium may also show the +3 oxidation state, which is not seen in any other alkali metal, in addition to the +1 oxidation state that is characteristic of the other alkali metals and is also the main oxidation state of all the known alkali metals: this is because of the destabilisation and expansion of the 7p3/2 spinor, causing its outermost electrons to have a lower ionisation energy than what would otherwise be expected.
666	Not as much work has been done predicting the properties of the alkali metals beyond ununennium.
666	Although a simple extrapolation of the periodic table would put element 169, unhexennium, under ununennium, Dirac-Fock calculations predict that the next alkali metal after ununennium may actually be element 165, unhexpentium, which is predicted to have the electron configuration [Uuo] 5g18 6f14 7d10 8s2 8p1/22 9s1.
666	Further calculations show that unhexpentium would follow the trend of increasing ionisation energy beyond caesium, having an ionisation energy comparable to that of sodium, and that it should also continue the trend of decreasing atomic radii beyond caesium, having an atomic radius comparable to that of potassium.
666	However, the 7d electrons of unhexpentium may also be able to participate in chemical reactions along with the 9s electron, possibly allowing oxidation states beyond +1 and perhaps even making unhexpentium behave more like a boron group element than an alkali metal.
666	The probable properties of the alkali metals beyond unhexpentium have not been explored yet as of 2012.
666	In periods 8 and above of the periodic table, relativistic and shell-structure effects become so strong that extrapolations from lighter congeners become completely inaccurate.
666	In addition, the relativistic and shell-structure effects (which stabilise the s-orbitals and destabilise and expand the d-, f-, and g-orbitals of higher shells) have opposite effects, causing even larger difference between relativistic and non-relativistic calculations of the properties of elements with such high atomic numbers.
666	Due to the alkali and alkaline earth metals both being s-block elements, these predictions for the trends and properties of ununennium and unhexpentium also mostly apply to the corresponding alkaline earth metals unbinilium (Ubn) and unhexhexium (Uhh).
666	Other similar substances Hydrogen The element hydrogen, with one electron per neutral atom, is usually placed at the top of Group 1 of the periodic table for convenience, but hydrogen is not normally considered to be an alkali metal; when it is considered to be an alkali metal, it is because of its atomic properties and not its chemical properties.
666	Under typical conditions, pure hydrogen exists as a diatomic gas consisting of two atoms per molecule (H2); however, the alkali metals only form diatomic molecules (such as dilithium, Li2) at high temperatures, when they are in the gaseous state.
666	Hydrogen, like the alkali metals, has one valence electron and reacts easily with the halogens, but the similarities end there.
666	Its placement above lithium is primarily due to its electron configuration and not its chemical properties.
666	It is sometimes placed above carbon due to their similar electronegativities or fluorine due to their similar chemical properties.
666	The first ionisation energy of hydrogen (1312.0 kJ/mol) is much higher than that of the alkali metals.
666	As only one additional electron is required to fill in the outermost shell of the hydrogen atom, hydrogen often behaves like a halogen, forming the negative hydride ion, and is sometimes considered to be a halogen.
666	The alkali metals can also form negative ions, known as alkalides, but tary 2012}} (The alkali metals chese are little more than laboratory curiosities, being unstable.) Under extremely high pressures, such as those found at the cores of Jupiter and Saturn, hydrogen does become metallic and behaves like an alkali metal; in this phase, it is known as metallic hydrogen.
666	Ammonium The ammonium ion () has very similar properties to the heavier alkali metals, acting as an alkali metal intermediate between potassium and rubidium, and is often considered a close relative.
666	For example, most alkali metal salts are soluble in water, a property which ammonium salts share.
666	Ammonium is expected to behave as a metal (NH ions in a sea of electrons) at very high pressures, such as inside the ice giants Uranus and Neptune.
666	Thallium Thallium displays the +1 oxidation state that all the known alkali metals display, and thallium compounds with thallium in its +1 oxidation state closely resemble the corresponding potassium or silver compounds due to the similar ionic radii of the Tl+ (164 pm), K+ (152 pm) and Ag+ (129 pm) ions.
666	It was sometimes considered an alkali metal in continental Europe (but not in England) in the years immediately following its discovery, and was placed just after caesium as the sixth alkali metal in Dmitri Mendeleev's 1869 periodic table and Julius Lothar Meyer's 1868 periodic table.
666	Mendeleev's 1871 periodic table and Meyer's 1870 periodic table put thallium in its current position in the boron group and leave the space below caesium blank.) However, thallium also displays the oxidation state +3, which no known alkali metal displays (although ununennium, the undiscovered seventh alkali metal, is predicted to possibly display the +3 oxidation state).
666	The sixth alkali metal is now considered to be francium.
666	History Etymology The alkali metals are so called because their hydroxides are all strong alkalis when dissolved in water.
666	Discovery Lithium Petalite (LiAlSi4O10) was discovered in 1800 by the Brazilian chemist José Bonifácio de Andrada in a mine on the island of Utö, Sweden.
666	However, it was not until 1817 that Johan August Arfwedson, then working in the laboratory of the chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius, detected the presence of a new element while analyzing petalite ore.
666	This new element formed compounds similar to those of sodium and potassium, though its carbonate and hydroxide were less soluble in water and more alkaline than the other alkali metals.
666	Berzelius gave the unknown material the name "lithion/lithina", from the Greek word λιθoς (transliterated as lithos, meaning "stone"), to reflect its discovery in a solid mineral, as opposed to potassium, which had been discovered in plant ashes, and sodium, which was known partly for its high abundance in animal blood.
666	He named the metal inside the material "lithium".
666	Sodium Sodium compounds have been known since ancient times; salt (sodium chloride) has been an important commodity in human activities, as testified by the English word salary, referring to salarium, the wafers of salt sometimes given to Roman soldiers along with their other wages.
666	In medieval Europe a compound of sodium with the Latin name of sodanum was used as a headache remedy.
666	Pure sodium was not isolated until 1807 by Humphry Davy through the electrolysis of caustic soda (now called sodium hydroxide), a very similar method to the one used to isolate potassium earlier that year.
666	Potassium While potash has been used since ancient times, it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts.
666	Georg Ernst Stahl obtained experimental evidence which led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702, and Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736.
666	The exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds, and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium, was not known then, and thus Antoine Lavoisier did include the alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789.
666	Pure potassium was first isolated in 1807 in England by Sir Humphry Davy, who derived it from caustic potash (KOH, potassium hydroxide) by the use of electrolysis of the molten salt with the newly invented voltaic pile.
666	Potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis.
666	Later that same year, Davy reported extraction of sodium from the similar substance caustic soda (NaOH, lye) by a similar technique, demonstrating the elements, and thus the salts, to be different.
666	Rubidium Rubidium was discovered in 1861 in Heidelberg, Germany by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff, the first people to suggest finding new elements by spectrum analysis, in the mineral lepidolite through the use of a spectroscope.
666	Because of the bright red lines in its emission spectrum, they chose a name derived from the Latin word rubidus, meaning dark red.
666	Rubidium's discovery succeeded that of caesium, also discovered by Bunsen and Kirchhoff through spectroscopy.
666	Caesium In 1860, Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff discovered caesium in the mineral water from Dürkheim, Germany.
666	Due to the bright-blue lines in its emission spectrum, they chose a name derived from the Latin word caesius, meaning sky-blue.
666	Caesium was the first element to be discovered spectroscopically, only one year after the invention of the spectroscope by Bunsen and Kirchhoff.
666	Francium There were at least four erroneous and incomplete discoveries before Marguerite Perey of the Curie Institute in Paris, France discovered francium in 1939 by purifying a sample of actinium-227, which had been reported to have a decay energy of 220 keV.
666	However, Perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below 80 keV.
666	Perey thought this decay activity might have been caused by a previously unidentified decay product, one that was separated during purification, but emerged again out of the pure actinium-227.
666	Various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being thorium, radium, lead, bismuth, or thallium.
666	The new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal (such as coprecipitating with caesium salts), which led Perey to believe that it was element 87, caused by the alpha decay of actinium-227.
666	Perey then attempted to determine the proportion of beta decay to alpha decay in actinium-227.
666	Her first test put the alpha branching at 0.6%, a figure that she later revised to 1%.
666	It was the last element discovered in nature, rather than by synthesis.
666	Eka-francium The next element below francium (eka-francium) is very likely to be ununennium (Uue), element 119, although this is not completely certain due to relativistic effects.
666	The synthesis of ununennium was first attempted in 1985 by bombarding a target of einsteinium-254 with calcium-48 ions at the superHILAC accelerator at Berkeley, California.
666	No atoms were identified, leading to a limiting yield of 300 nb.
666	It is highly unlikely that this reaction will be able to create any atoms of ununennium in the near future, given the extremely difficult task of making sufficient amounts of 254Es, which is favoured for production of ultraheavy elements because of its large mass, relatively long half-life of 270 days, and availability in significant amounts of several micrograms, to make a large enough target to increase the sensitivity of the experiment to the required level; einsteinium has not been found in nature and has only been produced in laboratories.
666	However, given that ununennium is only the first period 8 element on the extended periodic table, it may well be discovered in the near future through other reactions; indeed, another attempt to synthesise ununennium by bombarding a berkelium target with titanium ions is under way at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany.
666	Currently, none of the period 8 elements have been discovered yet, and it is also possible, due to drip instabilities, that only the lower period 8 elements, up to around element 128, are physically possible.
666	No attempts at synthesis have been made for any heavier alkali metals, such as unhexpentium, due to their extremely high atomic number.
666	Occurrence In the Solar System The Oddo-Harkins rule holds that elements with even atomic numbers are more common that those with odd atomic numbers, with the exception of hydrogen.
666	This rule argues that elements with odd atomic numbers have one unpaired proton and are more likely to capture another, thus increasing their atomic number.
666	In elements with even atomic numbers, protons are paired, with each member of the pair offsetting the spin of the other, enhancing stability.
666	All the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers and they are not as common as the elements with even atomic numbers adjacent to them (the noble gases and the alkaline earth metals) in the Solar System.
666	The heavier alkali metals are also less abundant than the lighter ones as the alkali metals from rubidium onward can only be synthesized in supernovae and not in stellar nucleosynthesis.
666	Lithium is also much less abundant than sodium and potassium as it is poorly synthesized in both Big Bang nucleosynthesis and in stars: the Big Bang could only produce trace quantities of lithium, beryllium and boron due to the absence of a stable nucleus with 5 or 8 nucleons, and stellar nucleosynthesis could only pass this bottleneck by the triple-alpha process, fusing three helium nuclei to form carbon, and skipping over those three elements.
666	On Earth The Earth formed from the same cloud of matter that formed the Sun, but the planets acquired different compositions during the formation and evolution of the solar system.
666	In turn, the natural history of the Earth caused parts of this planet to have differing concentrations of the elements.
666	The mass of the Earth is approximately 5.98 kg.
666	It is composed mostly of iron (32.1%), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminium (1.4%); with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements.
666	Due to mass segregation, the core region is believed to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.
666	The alkali metals, due to their high reactivity, do not occur naturally in pure form in nature.
666	They are lithophiles and therefore remain close to the Earth's surface because they combine readily with oxygen and so associate strongly with silica, forming relatively low-density minerals that do not sink down into the Earth's core.
666	Potassium, rubidium and caesium are also incompatible elements due to their low ionic radii.
666	Sodium and potassium are very abundant in earth, both being among the ten most common elements in Earth's crust; sodium makes up approximately 2.6% of the Earth's crust measured by weight, making it the sixth most abundant element overall and the most abundant alkali metal.
666	Potassium makes up approximately 1.5% of the Earth's crust and is the seventh most abundant element.
666	Sodium is found in many different minerals, of which the most common is ordinary salt (sodium chloride), which occurs in vast quantities dissolved in seawater.
666	Other solid deposits include halite, amphibole, cryolite, nitratine, and zeolite.
666	Lithium, due to its relatively low reactivity, can be found in seawater in large amounts; it is estimated that seawater is approximately 0.14 to 0.25 parts per million (ppm) or 25 micromolar.
666	Rubidium is approximately as abundant as zinc and more abundant than copper.
666	It occurs naturally in the minerals leucite, pollucite, carnallite, zinnwaldite, and lepidolite.
666	Caesium is more abundant than some commonly known elements, such as antimony, cadmium, tin, and tungsten, but is much less abundant than rubidium.
666	Francium-223, the only naturally occurring isotope of francium, is the product of the alpha decay of actinium-227 and can be found in trace amounts in uranium and thorium minerals.
666	In a given sample of uranium, there is estimated to be only one francium atom for every 1018 uranium atoms.
666	It has been calculated that there is at most 30 g of francium in the earth's crust at any time, due to its extremely short half-life of 22 minutes.
666	Production The production of pure alkali metals is difficult due to their extreme reactivity with commonly used substances, such as water.
666	The alkali metals are so reactive that they cannot be displaced by other elements and must be isolated through electrolysis.
666	Lithium salts have to be extracted from the water of mineral springs, brine pools, and brine deposits.
666	The metal is produced electrolytically from a mixture of fused lithium chloride and potassium chloride.
666	Potassium occurs in many minerals, such as sylvite (potassium chloride).
666	It is occasionally produced through separating the potassium from the chlorine in potassium chloride, but is more often produced through electrolysis of potassium hydroxide, found extensively in places such as Canada, Russia, Belarus, Germany, Israel, United States, and Jordan, in a method similar to how sodium was produced in the late 1800s and early 1900s.
666	It can also be produced from seawater.
666	Sodium occurs mostly in seawater and dried seabed, but is now produced through electrolysis of sodium chloride by lowering the melting point of the substance to below 700 °C through the use of a Downs cell.
666	Extremely pure sodium can be produced through the thermal decomposition of sodium azide.
666	For several years in the 1950s and 1960s, a by-product of the potassium production called Alkarb was a main source for rubidium.
666	Alkarb contained 21% rubidium while the rest was potassium and a small fraction of caesium.
666	Today the largest producers of caesium, for example the  Tanco Mine, Manitoba, Canada, produce rubidium as by-product from pollucite.
666	Today, a common method for separating rubidium from potassium and caesium is the fractional crystallization of a rubidium and caesium alum (Cs,Rb)Al(SO4)2·12H2O, which yields pure rubidium alum after approximately 30 different reactions.
666	The limited applications and the lack of a mineral rich in rubidium limits the production of rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 tonnes per year.
666	Caesium, however, is not produced from the above reaction.
666	Instead, the mining of pollucite ore is the main method of obtaining pure caesium, extracted from the ore mainly by three methods: acid digestion, alkaline decomposition, and direct reduction.
666	Francium-223, the only naturally occurring isotope of francium, is produced naturally as the product of the alpha decay of actinium-227.
666	Francium can be found in trace amounts in uranium and thorium minerals; it has been calculated that at most there are 30 g of francium in the earth's crust at any given time.
666	As a result of its extreme rarity in nature, most franciul |accessdate =26 Marcm is synthesized in the nuclear reaction 197Au + 18O → 210Fr + 5 n, yielding francium-209, francium-210, and francium-211.
666	The greatest quantity of francium ever assembled to date is about 300,000 neutral atoms, which were synthesized using the nuclear reaction given above.
666	Applications All of the discovered alkali metals excluding francium have many applications.
666	Lithium is often used in batteries, and lithium oxide can help process silica.
666	Lithium can also be used to make lubricating greases, air treatment, and aluminium production.
666	Pure sodium has many applications, including use in sodium-vapour lamps, which produce very efficient light compared to other types of lighting, and can help smooth the surface of other metals.
666	Sodium compounds have many applications as well, the most well-known compound being table salt.
666	Sodium is also used in soap as salts of fatty acids.
666	Potassium compounds are often used as fertilisers as potassium is an important element for plant nutrition.
666	Other potassium ions are often used to hold anions.
666	Potassium hydroxide is a very strong base, and is used to control the pH of various substances.
666	Rubidium and caesium are often used in atomic clocks.
666	Caesium atomic clocks are extraordinarily accurate; if a clock had been made at the time of the dinosaurs, it would be off by less than four seconds (after 80 million years).
666	For that reason, caesium atoms are used as the definition of the second.
666	Rubidium ions are often used in purple fireworks, and caesium is often used in drilling fluids in the petroleum industry.
666	Francium has no commercial applications, but because of francium's relatively simple atomic structure, among other things, it has been used in spectroscopy experiments, leading to more information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between subatomic particles.
666	Studies on the light emitted by laser-trapped francium-210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels, similar to those predicted by quantum theory.
666	Biological role and precautions Lithium does not occur naturally in biological systems and has no biological role, but does have effects on the body when ingested.
666	Lithium carbonate is used as a mood stabiliser in psychiatry to treat bipolar disorder (manic-depression) in daily doses of about 0.5 to 2 grams, although there are side-effects.
666	Excessive ingestion of lithium causes drowsiness, slurred speech and vomiting, among other symptoms, and poisons the central nervous system, which is dangerous as the required dosage of lithium to treat bipolar disorder is only slightly lower than the toxic dosage.
666	Its biochemistry, the way it is handled by the human body and studies using rats and goats suggest that it is an essential trace element, although the natural biological function of lithium in humans has yet to be identified.
666	Sodium and potassium occur in all known biological systems, generally functioning as electrolytes inside and outside cells.
666	Sodium is an essential nutrient that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day.
666	Sodium chloride (also known as common salt) is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative, such as for pickling and jerky; most of it comes from processed foods.
666	The DRI for sodium is 1.5 grams per day, but most people in the United States consume more than 2.3 grams per day, the minimum amount that promotes hypertension; this in turn causes 7.6 million premature deaths worldwide.
666	Potassium is the major cation (positive ion) inside animal cells, while sodium is the major cation outside animal cells.
666	The concentration differences of these charged particles causes a difference in electric potential between the inside and outside of cells, known as the membrane potential.
666	The balance between potassium and sodium is maintained by ion pumps in the cell membrane.
666	The cell membrane potential created by potassium and sodium ions allows the cell to generate an action potential—a "spike" of electrical discharge.
666	The ability of cells to produce electrical discharge is critical for body functions such as neurotransmission, muscle contraction, and heart function.
666	Rubidium has no known biological role, but may help stimulate metabolism, and, similarly to caesium, replace potassium in the body causing potassium deficiency.
666	Caesium compounds are rarely encountered by most people, but most caesium compounds are mildly toxic because of chemical similarity of caesium to potassium, allowing the caesium to replace the potassium in the body, causing potassium deficiency.
666	Exposure to large amounts of caesium compounds can cause hyperirritability and spasms, but as such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources, caesium is not a major chemical environmental pollutant.
666	The median lethal dose (LD50) value for caesium chloride in mice is 2.3 g per kilogram, which is comparable to the LD50 values of potassium chloride and sodium chloride.
666	Caesium chloride has been promoted as an alternative cancer therapy, but has been linked to the deaths of over 50 patients, on whom it was used as part of a scientifically unvalidated cancer treatment.
666	Radioisotopes of caesium require special precautions: the improper handling of caesium-137 gamma ray sources can lead to release of this radioisotope and radiation injuries.
666	Perhaps the best-known case is the Goiânia accident of 1987, in which an improperly-disposed-of radiation therapy system from an abandoned clinic in the city of Goiânia, Brazil, was scavenged from a junkyard, and the glowing caesium salt sold to curious, uneducated buyers.
666	This led to four deaths and serious injuries from radiation exposure.
666	Together with caesium-134, iodine-131, and strontium-90, caesium-137 was among the isotopes distributed by the Chernobyl disaster which constitute the greatest risk to health.
666	Francium has no biological role and is most likely to be toxic due to its extreme radioactivity, causing radiation poisoning, but since the greatest quantity of francium ever assembled to date is   about 300,000 neutral atoms, it is unlikely that most people will ever encounter francium.
666	Notes
670	An alphabet is a standard set of letters (basic written symbols or graphemes) which is used to write one or more languages based on the general principle that the letters represent phonemes (basic significant sounds) of the spoken language.
670	This is in contrast to other types of writing systems, such as syllabaries (in which each character represents a syllable) and logographies (in which each character represents a word, morpheme or semantic unit).
670	A true alphabet has letters for the vowels of a language as well as the consonants.
670	The first "true alphabet" in this sense is believed to be the Greek alphabet, which is a modified form of the Phoenician alphabet.
670	In other types of alphabet either the vowels are not indicated at all, as was the case in the Phoenician alphabet (such systems are known as abjads), or else the vowels are shown by diacritics or modification of consonants, as in the devanagari used in India and Nepal (these systems are known as abugidas or alphasyllabaries).
670	There are dozens of alphabets in use today, the most popular being the Latin alphabet (which was derived from the Greek).
670	Many languages use modified forms of the Latin alphabet, with additional letters formed using diacritical marks.
670	While most alphabets have letters composed of lines (linear writing), there are also exceptions such as the alphabets used in Braille, fingerspelling, and Morse code.
670	Alphabets are usually associated with a standard ordering of their letters.
670	This makes them useful for purposes of collation, specifically by allowing words to be sorted in alphabetical order.
670	It also means that their letters can be used as an alternative method of "numbering" ordered items, in such contexts as numbered lists.
670	Etymology The English word alphabet came into Middle English from the Late Latin word alphabetum, which in turn originated in the Greek ἀλφάβητος (alphabētos), from alpha and beta, the first two letters of the Greek alphabet.
670	Alpha and beta in turn came from the first two letters of the Phoenician alphabet, and originally meant ox and house respectively.
670	History Middle Eastern scripts The history of the alphabet started in ancient Egypt.
670	By the 27th century BC Egyptian writing had a set of some 24 hieroglyphs which are called uniliterals, to represent syllables that begin with a single consonant of their language, plus a vowel (or no vowel) to be supplied by the native speaker.
670	These glyphs were used as pronunciation guides for logograms, to write grammatical inflections, and, later, to transcribe loan words and foreign names.
670	In the Middle Bronze Age an apparently "alphabetic" system known as the Proto-Sinaitic script appears in Egyptian turquoise mines in the Sinai peninsula dated to circa the 15th century BC, apparently left by Canaanite workers.
670	In 1999, John and Deborah Darnell discovered an even earlier version of this first alphabet at Wadi el-Hol dated to circa 1800 BC and showing evidence of having been adapted from specific forms of Egyptian hieroglyphs that could be dated to circa 2000 BC, strongly suggesting that the first alphabet had been developed circa that time.
670	Based on letter appearances and names, it is believed to be based on Egyptian hieroglyphs.
670	This script had no characters representing vowels.
670	An alphabetic cuneiform script with 30 signs including three which indicate the following vowel was invented in Ugarit before the 15th century BC.
670	This script was not used after the destruction of Ugarit.
670	The South Arabian alphabet, a sister script to the Phoenician alphabet, is the script from which the Ge'ez alphabet (an abugida) is descended.
670	Vowelless alphabets, which are not true alphabets, are called abjads, currently exemplified in scripts including Arabic, Hebrew, and Syriac.
670	The omission of vowels was not a satisfactory solution and some "weak" consonants were used to indicate the vowel quality of a syllable (matres lectionis).
670	These had dual function since they were also used as pure consonants.
670	The Proto-Sinatic or Proto Canaanite script and the Ugaritic script were the first scripts with limited number of signs, in contrast to the other widely used writing systems at the time, Cuneiform, Egyptian hieroglyphs, and Linear B.
670	The Phoenician script was probably the first phonemic script and it contained only about two dozen distinct letters, making it a script simple enough for common traders to learn.
670	Another advantage of Phoenician was that it could be used to write down many different languages, since it recorded words phonemically.
670	The script was spread by the Phoenicians, across the Mediterranean.
670	In Greece, the script was modified to add the vowels, giving rise to the ancestor of all alphabets in the West.
670	The indication of the vowels is the same way as the indication of the consonants, therefore it was the first true alphabet.
670	The Greeks took letters which did not represent sounds that existed in Greek, and changed them to represent the vowels.
670	The vowels are significant in the Greek language, and the syllabical Linear B script which was used by the Mycenaean Greeks from the 16th century BC had 87 symbols including 5 vowels.
670	In its early years, there were many variants of the Greek alphabet, a situation which caused many different alphabets to evolve from it.
670	European alphabets The Greek alphabet, in its Euboean form, was carried over by Greek colonists to the Italian peninsula, where it gave rise to a variety of alphabets used to write the Italic languages.
670	One of these became the Latin alphabet, which was spread across Europe as the Romans expanded their empire.
670	Even after the fall of the Roman state, the alphabet survived in intellectual and religious works.
670	It eventually became used for the descendant languages of Latin (the Romance languages) and then for most of the other languages of Europe.
670	Some adaptations of the Latin alphabet are augmented with ligatures, such as æ in Old English and Icelandic and Ȣ in Algonquian; by borrowings from other alphabets, such as the thorn þ in Old English and Icelandic, which came from the Futhark runes; and by modifying existing letters, such as the eth ð of Old English and Icelandic, which is a modified d.
670	Other alphabets only use a subset of the Latin alphabet, such as Hawaiian, and Italian, which uses the letters j, k, x, y and w only in foreign words.
670	Another notable script is Elder Futhark, which is believed to have evolved out of one of the Old Italic alphabets.
670	Elder Futhark gave rise to a variety of alphabets known collectively as the Runic alphabets.
670	The Runic alphabets were used for Germanic languages from AD 100 to the late Middle Ages.
670	Its usage is mostly restricted to engravings on stone and jewelry, although inscriptions have also been found on bone and wood.
670	These alphabets have since been replaced with the Latin alphabet, except for decorative usage for which the runes remained in use until the 20th century.
670	The Old Hungarian script is a contemporary writing system of the Hungarians.
670	It was in use during the entire history of Hungary, albeit not as an official writing system.
670	From the 19th century it once again became more and more popular.
670	The Glagolitic alphabet was the initial script of the liturgical language Old Church Slavonic and became, together with the Greek uncial script, the basis of the Cyrillic script.
670	Cyrillic is one of the most widely used modern alphabetic scripts, and is notable for its use in Slavic languages and also for other languages within the former Soviet Union.
670	Cyrillic alphabets include the Serbian, Macedonian, Bulgarian, and Russian alphabets.
670	The Glagolitic alphabet is believed to have been created by Saints Cyril and Methodius, while the Cyrillic alphabet was invented by the Bulgarian scholar Clement of Ohrid, who was their disciple.
670	They feature many letters that appear to have been borrowed from or influenced by the Greek alphabet and the Hebrew alphabet.
670	Asian alphabets Beyond the logographic Chinese writing, many phonetic scripts are in existence in Asia.
670	The Arabic alphabet, Hebrew alphabet, Syriac alphabet, and other abjads of the Middle East are developments of the Aramaic alphabet, but because these writing systems are largely consonant-based they are often not considered true alphabets.
670	Most alphabetic scripts of India and Eastern Asia are descended from the Brahmi script, which is often believed to be a descendant of Aramaic.
670	In Korea, the Hangul alphabet was created by Sejong the Great Hangul is a unique alphabet: it is a featural alphabet, where many of the letters are designed from a sound's place of articulation (P to look like the widened mouth, L to look like the tongue pulled in, etc.); its design was planned by the government of the day; and it places individual letters in syllable clusters with equal dimensions, in the same way as Chinese characters, to allow for mixed-script writing (one syllable always takes up one type-space no matter how many letters get stacked into building that one sound-block).
670	Zhuyin (sometimes called Bopomofo) is a semi-syllabary used to phonetically transcribe Mandarin Chinese in the Republic of China.
670	After the later establishment of the People's Republic of China and its adoption of Hanyu Pinyin, the use of Zhuyin today is limited, but it's still widely used in Taiwan where the Republic of China still governs.
670	Zhuyin developed out of a form of Chinese shorthand based on Chinese characters in the early 1900s and has elements of both an alphabet and a syllabary.
670	Like an alphabet the phonemes of syllable initials are represented by individual symbols, but like a syllabary the phonemes of the sylble initials are represented by individual symbols, but lilable rime|syllable finals are not; rather, each possible final (excluding the medial glide) is represented by its own symbol.
670	For example, luan is represented as ㄌㄨㄢ (l-u-an), where the last symbol ㄢ represents the entire final -an.
670	While Zhuyin is not used as a mainstream writing system, it is still often used in ways similar to a romanization system—that is, for aiding in pronunciation and as an input method for Chinese characters on computers and cellphones.
670	European alphabets, especially Latin and Cyrillic, have been adapted for many languages of Asia.
670	Arabic is also widely used, sometimes as an abjad (as with Urdu and Persian) and sometimes as a complete alphabet (as with Kurdish and Uyghur).
670	Types The term "alphabet" is used by linguists and paleographers in both a wide and a narrow sense.
670	In the wider sense, an alphabet is a script that is segmental at the phoneme level—that is, it has separate glyphs for individual sounds and not for larger units such as syllables or words.
670	In the narrower sense, some scholars distinguish "true" alphabets from two other types of segmental script, abjads and abugidas.
670	These three differ from each other in the way they treat vowels: abjads have letters for consonants and leave most vowels unexpressed; abugidas are also consonant-based, but indicate vowels with diacritics to or a systematic graphic modification of the consonants.
670	In alphabets in the narrow sense, on the other hand, consonants and vowels are written as independent letters.
670	The earliest known alphabet in the wider sense is the Wadi el-Hol script, believed to be an abjad, which through its successor Phoenician is the ancestor of modern alphabets, including Arabic, Greek, Latin (via the Old Italic alphabet), Cyrillic (via the Greek alphabet) and Hebrew (via Aramaic).
670	Examples of present-day abjads are the Arabic and Hebrew scripts; true alphabets include Latin, Cyrillic, and Korean hangul; and abugidas are used to write Tigrinya, Amharic, Hindi, and Thai.
670	The Canadian Aboriginal syllabics are also an abugida rather than a syllabary as their name would imply, since each glyph stands for a consonant which is modified by rotation to represent the following vowel.
670	In a true syllabary, each consonant-vowel combination would be represented by a separate glyph.) All three types may be augmented with syllabic glyphs.
670	Ugaritic, for example, is basically an abjad, but has syllabic letters for.
670	These are the only time vowels are indicated.) Cyrillic is basically a true alphabet, but has syllabic letters for (я, е, ю); Coptic has a letter for.
670	Devanagari is typically an abugida augmented with dedicated letters for initial vowels, though some traditions use अ as a zero consonant as the graphic base for such vowels.
670	The boundaries between the three types of segmental scripts are not always clear-cut.
670	For example, Sorani Kurdish is written in the Arabic script, which is normally an abjad.
670	However, in Kurdish, writing the vowels is mandatory, and full letters are used, so the script is a true alphabet.
670	Other languages may use a Semitic abjad with mandatory vowel diacritics, effectively making them abugidas.
670	On the other hand, the Phagspa script of the Mongol Empire was based closely on the Tibetan abugida, but all vowel marks were written after the preceding consonant rather than as diacritic marks.
670	Although short a was not written, as in the Indic abugidas, one could argue that the linear arrangement made this a true alphabet.
670	Conversely, the vowel marks of the Tigrinya abugida and the Amharic abugida (ironically, the original source of the term "abugida") have been so completely assimilated into their consonants that the modifications are no longer systematic and have to be learned as a syllabary rather than as a segmental script.
670	Even more extreme, the Pahlavi abjad eventually became logographic.
670	See below.) Thus the primary classification of alphabets reflects how they treat vowels.
670	For tonal languages, further classification can be based on their treatment of tone, though names do not yet exist to distinguish the various types.
670	Some alphabets disregard tone entirely, especially when it does not carry a heavy functional load, as in Somali tirely, especially when it doeand many other languages of Africa and the Americas.
670	Such scripts are to tone what abjads are to vowels.
670	Most commonly, tones are indicated with diacritics, the way vowels are treated in abugidas.
670	This is the case for Vietnamese (a true alphabet) and Thai (an abugida).
670	In Thai, tone is determined primarily by the choice of consonant, with diacritics for disambiguation.
670	In the Pollard script, an abugida, vowels are indicated by diacritics, but the placement of the diacritic relative to the consonant is modified to indicate the tone.
670	More rarely, a script may have separate letters for tones, as is the case for Hmong and Zhuang.
670	For most of these scripts, regardless of whether letters or diacritics are used, the most common tone is not marked, just as the most common vowel is not marked in Indic abugidas; in Zhuyin not only is one of the tones unmarked, but there is a diacritic to indicate lack of tone, like the virama of Indic.
670	The number of letters in an alphabet can be quite small.
670	The Book Pahlavi script, an abjad, had only twelve letters at one point, and may have had even fewer later on.
670	Today the Rotokas alphabet has only twelve letters.
670	The Hawaiian alphabet is sometimes claimed to be as small, but it actually consists of 18 letters, including the ʻokina and five long vowels.) While Rotokas has a small alphabet because it has few phonemes to represent (just eleven), Book Pahlavi was small because many letters had been conflated—that is, the graphic distinctions had been lost over time, and diacritics were not developed to compensate for this as they were in Arabic, another script that lost many of its distinct letter shapes.
670	For example, a comma-shaped letter represented g, d, y, k, or j.
670	However, such apparent simplifications can perversely make a script more complicated.
670	In later Pahlavi papyri, up to half of the remaining graphic distinctions of these twelve letters were lost, and the script could no longer be read as a sequence of letters at all, but instead each word had to be learned as a whole—that is, they had become logograms as in Egyptian Demotic.
670	The alphabet in the Polish language contains 32 letters.
670	The largest segmental script is probably an abugida, Devanagari.
670	When written in Devanagari, Vedic Sanskrit has an alphabet of 53 letters, including the visarga mark for final aspiration and special letters for kš and jñ, though one of the letters is theoretical and not actually used.
670	The Hindi alphabet must represent both Sanskrit and modern vocabulary, and so has been expanded to 58 with the khutma letters (letters with a dot added) to represent sounds from Persian and English.
670	The largest known abjad is Sindhi, with 51 letters.
670	The largest alphabets in the narrow sense include Kabardian and Abkhaz (for Cyrillic), with 58 and 56 letters, respectively, and Slovak (for the Latin script), with 46.
670	However, these scripts either count di- and tri-graphs as separate letters, as Spanish did with ch and ll until recently, or uses diacritics like Slovak č.
670	The largest true alphabet where each letter is graphically independent is probably Georgian, with 41 letters.
670	Syllabaries typically contain 50 to 400 glyphs, and the glyphs of logographic systems typically number from the many hundreds into the thousands.
670	Thus a simple count of the number of distinct symbols is an important clue to the nature of an unknown script.
670	Alphabetical order Alphabets often come to be associated with a standard ordering of their letters, which can then be used for purposes of collation – namely for the listing of words and other items in what is called alphabetical order.
670	The basic ordering of the Latin alphabet (ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ), which is derived from the Northwest Semitic "Abgad" order, is well established, although languages using this alphabet have different conventions for their treatment of modified letters (such as the French é, à, and ô) and of certain combinations of letters (multigraphs).
670	In French, these are not considered to be additional letters for the purposes of collation.
670	However, in Icelandic, the accented letters such as á, í, and ö are considered to be distinct letters of the alphabet.
670	In Spanish, ñ is considered a separate letter, but accented vowels such as á and é are not.
670	The ll and ch were also considered single letters, but in 1994 the Real Academia Española changed collating order so that ll is between lk and lm in the dictionary and ch is between cg and ci, and in 2010 the tenth congress of the Association of Spanish Language Academies changed it so they were no longer letters at all In German, words starting with sch- (constituting the German phoneme) would be intercalated between words with initial sca- and sci- (all incidentally loanwords) instead of this graphic cluster appearing after the letter s, as though it were a single letter—a lexicographical policy which would be de rigueur in a dictionary of Albanian, i.e.
670	Nor is, in a dictionary of English, the lexical section with initial th- reserved a place after the letter t, but is inserted between te- and ti-.
670	German words with umlaut would further be alphabetized as if there were no umlaut at all—contrary to Turkish which allegedly adopted the German graphemes ö and ü, and where a word like tüfek, would come after tuz, in the dictionary.
670	An exception is the German phonebook where umlauts are sorted like ä = ae since names as Jäger appear also with the spelling Jaeger, and there's no telling them apart in the spoken language.
670	The Danish and Norwegian alphabets end with æ—ø—å, whereas the Icelandic, Swedish, Finnish and Estonian ones conventionally put å—ä—ö at the end.
670	It is unknown whether the earliest alphabets had a defined sequence.
670	Some alphabets today, such as the Hanuno'o script, are learned one letter at a time, in no particular order, and are not used for collation where a definite order is required.
670	However, a dozen Ugaritic tablets from the fourteenth century BC preserve the alphabet in two sequences.
670	One, the ABCDE order later used in Phoenician, has continued with minor changes in Hebrew, Greek, Armenian, Gothic, Cyrillic, and Latin; the other, HM|Armenian, Gothic, Cyrillic, and Ethiopic.
670	Both orders have therefore been stable for at least 3000 years.
670	The historical order was abandoned in Runic and Arabic, although Arabic retains the traditional abjadi order for numbering.
670	The Brahmic family of alphabets used in India use a unique order based on phonology: The letters are arranged according to how and where they are produced in the mouth.
670	This organization is used in Southeast Asia, Tibet, Korean hangul, and even Japanese kana, which is not an alphabet.
670	Names of letters The Phoenician letter names, in which each letter was associated with a word that begins with that sound, continue to be used to varying degrees in Samaritan, Aramaic, Syriac, Hebrew, Greek and Arabic.
670	The names were abandoned in Latin, which instead referred to the letters by adding a vowel (usually e) before or after the consonant (the exception is zeta, which was retained from Greek).
670	In Cyrillic originally the letters were given names based on Slavic words; this was later abandoned as well in favor of a system similar to that used in Latin.
670	Orthography and pronunciation When an alphabet is adopted or developed for use in representing a given language, an orthography generally comes into being, providing rules for the spelling of words in that language.
670	In accordance with the principle on which alphabets are based, these rules will generally map letters of the alphabet to the phonemes (significant sounds) of the spoken language.
670	In a perfectly phonemic orthography there would be a consistent one-to-one correspondence between the letters and the phonemes, so that a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation, and a speaker could predict the pronunciation of a word given its spelling.
670	However this ideal is not normally achieved in practice; some languages (such as Spanish and Finnish) come close to it, while others (such as English) deviate from it to a much larger degree.
670	The pronunciation of a language often evolves independently of its writing system, and writing systems have been borrowed for languages they were not designed for, so the degree to which letters of an alphabet correspond to phonemes of a language varies greatly from one language to another and even within a single language.
670	Languages may fail to achieve a one-to-one correspondence between letters and sounds in any of several ways: * A language may represent a given phoneme with a combination of letters rather than just a single letter.
670	Two-letter combinations are called digraphs and three-letter groups are called trigraphs.
670	German uses the tesseragraphs (four letters) "tsch" for the phoneme and "dsch" for, although the latter is rare.
670	Kabardian also uses a tesseragraph for one of its phonemes, namely "кхъу".
670	Two letters representing one sound is widely used in Hungarian as well (where, for instance, cs stands for [č], sz for [s], zs for [ž], dzs for [ǰ], etc.).
670	A language may represent the same phoneme with two different letters or combinations of letters.
670	An example is modern Greek which may write the phoneme in six different ways: ⟨ι⟩, ⟨η⟩, ⟨υ⟩, ⟨ει⟩, ⟨οι⟩, and ⟨υι⟩ (although the last is rare).
670	A language may spell some words with unpronounced letters that exist for historical or other reasons.
670	For example, the spelling of the Thai word for "beer" [เบียร์] retains a letter for the final consonant "r" present in the English word it was borrowed from, but silences it.
670	Pronunciation of individual words may change according to the presence of surrounding words in a sentence (sandhi).
670	Different dialects of a language may use different phonemes for the same word.
670	A language may use different sets of symbols or different rules for distinct sets of vocabulary items, such as the Japanese hiragana and katakana syllabaries, or the various rules in English for spelling words from Latin and Greek, or the original Germanic vocabulary.
670	National languages generally elect to address the problem of dialects by simply associating the alphabet with the national standard.
670	However, with an international language with wide variations in its dialects, such as English, it would be impossible to represent the language in all its variations with a single phonetic alphabet.
670	Some national languages like Finnish, Turkish, Serbo-Croatian (Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian) and Bulgarian have a very regular spelling system with a nearly one-to-one correspondence between letters and phonemes.
670	Strictly speaking, these national languages lack a word corresponding to the verb "to spell" (meaning to split a word into its letters), the closest match being a verb meaning to split a word into its syllables.
670	Similarly, the Italian verb corresponding to 'spell (out)', compitare, is unknown to many Italians because the act of spelling itself is rarely needed: Italian spelling is highly phonemic.
670	In standard Spanish, it is possible to tell the pronunciation of a word from its spelling, but not vice versa; this is because certain phonemes can be represented in more than one way, but a given letter is consistently pronounced.
670	French, with its silent letters and its heavy use of nasal vowels and elision, may seem to lack much correspondence between spelling and pronunciation, but its rules on pronunciation, though complex, are actually consistent and predictable with a fair degree of accuracy.
670	At the other extreme are languages such as English, where the spelling of many words simply has to be memorized as they do not correspond to sounds in a consistent way.
670	For English, this is partly because the Great Vowel Shift occurred after the orthography was established, and because English has acquired a large number of loanwords at different times, retaining their original spelling at varying levels.
670	Even English has general, albeit complex, rules that predict pronunciation from spelling, and these rules are successful most of the time; rules to predict spelling from the pronunciation have a higher failure rate.
670	Sometimes, countries have the written language undergo a spelling reform to realign the writing with the contemporary spoken language.
670	These can range from simple spelling changes and word forms to switching the entire writing system itself, as when Turkey switched from the Arabic alphabet to a Turkish alphabet of Latin origin.
670	The sounds of speech of all languages of the world can be written by a rather-small universal phonetic-alphabet.
670	A standard for this is the International Phonetic Alphabet.
673	In chemistry and physics, the atomic number (also known as the proton number) is the number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom and therefore identical to the charge number of the nucleus.
673	It is conventionally represented by the symbol Z.
673	The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element.
673	In an atom of neutral charge, the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons.
673	The atomic number, Z, should not be confused with the mass number, A, which is the number of nucleons, the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom.
673	The number of neutrons, N, is known as the neutron number of the atom; thus, A = Z + N.
673	Since protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass (and the mass of the electrons is negligible for many purposes), and the mass defect is usually very small compared to the mass, the atomic mass of an atom is roughly equal to A.
673	Atoms having the same atomic number Z but different neutron number N, and hence different atomic mass, are known as isotopes.
673	Most naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes, and the average atomic mass of this mixture determines the element's atomic weight.
673	The conventional symbol Z comes from the German word  meaning number/numeral/figure, which prior to the modern synthesis of ideas from chemistry and physics, merely denoted an element's numerical place in the periodic table.
673	Only after 1915, with the suggestion and evidence that this Z number was also the nuclear charge and a physical characteristic of atoms, did the word  and its English equivalent atomic number come into common use.
673	History Loosely speaking, the existence of a periodic table creates an ordering for the elements.
673	Such an ordering is not necessarily a numbering, but can be used to construct a numbering by fiat.
673	Dmitri Mendeleev claimed he arranged his tables in order of atomic weight ("Atomgewicht") However, in deference to the observed chemical properties, he violated his own rule and placed tellurium (atomic weight 127.6) ahead of iodine (atomic weight 126.9).
673	This placement is consistent with the modern practice of ordering the elements by proton number, Z, but this number was not known or suspected at the time.
673	A simple numbering based on periodic table position was never entirely satisfactory.
673	Besides iodine and tellurium, later several other pairs of elements (such as argon and potassium, cobalt and nickel) were known to have nearly identical or reversed atomic weights, leaving their placement in the periodic table by chemical properties to be in violation of known physical properties.
673	Another problem was that the gradual identification of more and more chemically similar and indistinguishable lanthanides, which were of an uncertain number, led to inconsistency and uncertainty in the numbering of elements at least from lutetium (element 71) onwards (hafnium was not known at this time).
673	In 1911, Ernest Rutherford gave a model of the atom in which a central core held most of the atom's mass and a positive charge which, in units of the electron's charge, was to be approximately equal to half of the atom's atomic weight, expressed in numbers of hydrogen atoms.
673	This central charge would thus be approximately half the atomic weight (though it was almost 25% off the figure for the atomic number in gold (Z  79, A   197), the single element from which Rutherford made his guess).
673	Nevertheless, in spite of Rutherford's estimation that gold had a central charge of about 100 (but was element Z = 79 on the periodic table), a month after Rutherford's paper appeared, Antonius van den Broek first formally suggested that the central charge and number of electrons in an atom was exactly equal to its place in the periodic table (also known as element number, atomic number, and symbolized Z).
673	This proved eventually to be the case.
673	The experimental situation improved dramatically after research by Henry Moseley in 1913.
673	Moseley, after discussions with Bohr who was at the same lab (and who had used Van den Broek's hypothesis in his Bohr model of the atom), decided to test Van den Broek and Bohr's hypothesis directly, by seeing if spectral lines emitted from excited atoms fit the Bohr theory's demand that the frequency of the spectral lines be proportional to a measure of the square of Z.
673	To do this, Moseley measured the wavelengths of the innermost photon transitions (K and L lines) produced by the elements from aluminum (Z  13) to gold (Z   79) used as a series of movable anodic targets inside an x-ray tube.
673	The square root of the frequency of these photons (x-rays) increased from one target to the next in a linear fashion.
673	This led to the conclusion (Moseley's law) that the atomic number does closely correspond (with an offset of one unit for K-lines, in Moseley's work) to the calculated electric charge of the nucleus, i.e.
673	Z.
673	Among other things, Moseley demonstrated that the lanthanide series (from lanthanum to lutetium inclusive) must have 15 members—no fewer and no more—which was far from obvious from the chemistry at that time.
673	The conventional symbol Z possibly comes from the German word  (atomic number).
673	However, prior to 1915, the word Zahl (simply number) was used for an element's assigned number in the periodic table.
673	Chemical properties Each element has a specific set of chemical properties as a consequence of the number of electrons present in the neutral atom, which is Z (the atomic number).
673	The configuration of these electrons follows from the principles of quantum mechanics.
673	The number of electrons in each element's electron shells, particularly the outermost valence shell, is the primary factor in determining its chemical bonding behavior.
673	Hence, it is the atomic number alone that determines the chemical properties of an element; and it is for this reason that an element can be defined as consisting of any mixture of atoms with a given atomic number.
673	New elements The quest for new elements is usually described using atomic numbers.
673	As of 2010, elements with atomic numbers 1 to 118 have been observed.
673	Synthesis of new elements is accomplished by bombarding target atoms of heavy elements with ions, such that the sum of the atomic numbers of the target and ion elements equals the atomic number of the element being created.
673	In general, the half-life becomes shorter as atomic number increases, though an "island of stability" may exist for undiscovered isotopes with certain numbers of protons and neutrons.
674	Anatomy (from the Greek  - anatemnō, "cut up, cut open", from ἀνά - ana, "on, upon", and τέμνω - temnō, "I cut") is a branch of biology and medicine that considers the structure of living things.
674	It is a general term that includes human anatomy, animal anatomy (zootomy), and plant anatomy (phytotomy).
674	In some of its facets anatomy is closely related to embryology, comparative anatomy and comparative embryology, through common roots in evolution.
674	Anatomy is subdivided into gross anatomy (or macroscopic anatomy) and microscopic anatomy.
674	Gross anatomy is the study of anatomical structures that can, when suitably presented or dissected, be seen by unaided vision with the naked eye.
674	Microscopic anatomy is the study of minute anatomical structures on a microscopic scale.
674	It includes histology (the study of tissues), and cytology (the study of cells).
674	The terms microanatomy and histology are also sometimes used synonymously (in which case the distinction between histology and cell biology isn't strictly made as described here).
674	The history of anatomy has been characterized, over time, by a continually developing understanding of the functions of organs and structures in the body.
674	Methods have also improved dramatically, advancing from examination of animals through dissection of cadavers (dead human bodies) to technologically complex techniques developed in the 20th century including X-ray, ultrasound, and MRI.
674	Anatomy should not be confused with anatomical pathology (also called morbid anatomy or histopathology), which is the study of the gross and microscopic appearances of diseased organ (anatomy)gy), which is the study of the|organs.
674	Superficial anatomy  Superficial anatomy or surface anatomy is important in anatomy being the study of anatomical landmarks that can be readily seen from the contours or the surface of the body.
674	With knowledge of superficial anatomy, physicians or veterinary surgeons gauge the position and anatomy of the associated deeper structures.
674	Superficial is a directional term that indicates one structure is located more externally than another, or closer to the surface of the body.
674	Animal anatomy  Insect anatomy  Vertebrate anatomy  Bird anatomy  Reptile anatomy  Fish anatomy  Mammal anatomy  Human anatomy  Human anatomy, including gross human anatomy and histology, is primarily the scientific study of the morphology of the adult human body.
674	Generally, students of certain biological sciences, paramedics, prosthetists and orthotists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nurses, and medical students learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models, skeletons, textbooks, diagrams, photographs, lectures and tutorials, and in addition, medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of dissection and inspection of cadavers.
674	The study of microscopic anatomy (or histology) can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations (or slides) under a microscope.
674	Human anatomy, physiology and biochemistry are complementary basic medical sciences, which are generally taught to medical students in their first year at medical school.
674	Human anatomy can be taught regionally or systemically; that is, respectively, studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest, or studying by specific systems, such as the nervous or respiratory systems.
674	The major anatomy textbook, Gray's Anatomy, has recently been reorganized from a systems format to a regional format, in line with modern teaching methods.
674	A thorough working knowledge of anatomy is required by physicians, especially surgeons and doctors working in some diagnostic specialties, such as histopathology and radiology.
674	Academic human anatomists are usually employed by universities, medical schools or teaching hospitals.
674	They are often involved in teaching anatomy, and research into certain systems, organs, tissues or cells.
674	Plant anatomy  Other branches  *Comparative anatomy relates to the comparison of anatomical structures (both gross and microscopic) in different animals.
674	Anthropological anatomy or physical anthropology relates to the comparison of the anatomy of different races of humans.
674	Artistic anatomy relates to anatomic studies for artistic reasons.
675	Affirming the consequent, sometimes called converse error or fallacy of the converse, is a formal fallacy of inferring the converse from the original statement.
675	The corresponding argument has the general form: #If P, then Q.
675	Q.
675	Therefore, P.
675	An argument of this form is invalid, i.e., the conclusion can be false even when statements 1 and 2 are true.
675	Since P was never asserted as the only sufficient condition for Q, other factors could account for Q (while P was false).
675	To put it differently, if P implies Q, the only inference that can be made is non-Q implies non-P.
675	Non-P and non-Q designate the opposite propositions to P and Q.)  Symbolically: (P ⇒ Q) ⇔ (non-Q ⇒ non-P) The name affirming the consequent derives from the premise Q, which affirms the "then" clause of the conditional premise.
675	Examples One way to demonstrate the invalidity of this argument form is with a counterexample with true premises but an obviously false conclusion.
675	For example: If Bill Gates owns Fort Knox, then he is rich.
675	Bill Gates is rich.
675	Therefore, Bill Gates owns Fort Knox.
675	Owning Fort Knox is not the only way to be rich.
675	Any number of other ways exist to be rich.
675	However, one can affirm with certainty that "if Bill Gates is not rich" (non-Q) then "Bill Gates does not own Fort Knox" (non-P) Arguments of rich" (the same form can sometimes seem superficially convincing, as in the following example: If I have the flu, then I have a sore throat.
675	I have a sore throat.
675	Therefore, I have the flu.
675	But having the flu is not the only cause of a sore throat since many illnesses cause sore throat, such as the common cold or strep throat.
676	Andrei Arsenyevich Tarkovsky (; 4 April 1932 – 29 December 1986) was a Soviet and Russian filmmaker, writer, film editor, film theorist, theatre and opera director.
676	Tarkovsky's films include Andrei Rublev, Solaris, The Mirror, and Stalker.
676	He directed the first five of his seven feature films in the Soviet Union; his last two films were produced in Italy and Sweden, respectively.
676	They are characterized by spirituality and metaphysical themes, long takes, lack of conventional dramatic structure, and distinctively authored use of cinematography.
676	Film director Ingmar Bergman said of Tarkovsky: Life Childhood and early life Tarkovsky was born in the village of Zavrazhye in the Yuryevetsky District of the Ivanovo Industrial Oblast to poet and translator Arseny Alexandrovich Tarkovsky, native of Kirovohrad, Ukraine; and Maria Ivanova Vishnyakova, a graduate of the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute.
676	Andrei's grandfather Aleksander Tarkowski was a Polish nobleman who worked as a bank clerk.
676	Tarkovsky spent his childhood in Yuryevets.
676	He was described by childhood friends as active and popular, having many friends and being typically in the center of action.
676	In 1937, his father left the family, subsequently volunteering for the army in 1941.
676	Tarkovsky stayed with his mother, moving with her and his sister Marina to Moscow, where she worked as a proofreader at a printing press.
676	In 1939, Tarkovsky enrolled at the Moscow School № 554.
676	During the war, the three evacuated to Yuryevets, living with his maternal grandmother.
676	In 1943, the family returned to Moscow.
676	Tarkovsky continued his studies at his old school, where the poet Andrey Voznesensky was one of his classmates.
676	He studied piano at a music school and attended classes at an art school.
676	The family lived on Shshipok Street in the Zamoskvorechye District in Moscow.
676	From November 1947 to Spring 1948 he was in the hospital with tuberculosis.
676	Many themes of his childhood — the evacuation, his mother and her two children, the withdrawn father, the time in the hospital — feature prominently in his film The Mirror.
676	Following high school graduation, from 1951 to 1952, Tarkovsky studied Arabic at the Oriental Institute in Moscow, a branch of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.
676	Although he already spoke some Arabic and was a successful student in his first semesters, he did not finish his studies and dropped out to work as a prospector for the Academy of Science Institute for Non-Ferrous Metals and Gold.
676	He participated in a year-long research expedition to the river Kureikye near Turukhansk in the Krasnoyarsk Province.
676	During this time in the Taiga Tarkovsky decided to study film.
676	Film school student Upon returning from the research expedition in 1954, Tarkovsky applied at the State Institute of Cinematography (VGIK) and was admitted to the film directing program.
676	He was in the same class as Irma Raush whom he married in April 1957.
676	The early Khrushchev era offered unique opportunities for young film directors.
676	Before 1953, annual film production was low and most films were directed by veteran directors.
676	After 1953, more films were produced, many of them by young directors.
676	The Khrushchev Thaw relaxed Soviet cultural restrictions a bit and permitted a limited influx of Western literature, films and music.
676	This allowed Tarkovsky to see films of the Italian neorealists, French New Wave, and of directors such as Kurosawa, Buñuel, Bergman, Bresson, Andrzej Wajda (whose film Ashes and Diamonds was a true experience for him) and Mizoguchi.
676	Tarkovsky absorbed the idea of the auteur as a necessary condition for creativity.
676	Tarkovsky's teacher and mentor was Mikhail Romm, who taught many film students who would later become influential film directors.
676	In 1956, Tarkovsky directed his first student short film, The Killers, from a short story of Ernest Hemingway.
676	The short film There Will Be No Leave Today and the screenplay Concentrate followed in 1958 and 1959.
676	An important influence on Tarkovsky was the film director Grigori Chukhrai, who was teaching at the VGIK.
676	Impressed by the talent of his student, Chukhrai offered Tarkovsky a position as assistant director for his film Clear Skies.
676	Tarkovsky initially showed interest but then decided to concentrate on his studies and his own projects.
676	During his third year at the VGIK, Tarkovsky met Andrei Konchalovsky.
676	They found much in common as they liked the same film directors and shared ideas on cinema and films.
676	In 1959, they wrote the script Antarctica — Distant Country, which was later published in the Moskovskij Komsomolets.
676	Tarkovsky submitted the script to Lenfilm, but it was rejected.
676	They were more successful with the script The Steamroller and the Violin, which they sold to Mosfilm.
676	This became Tarkovsky's graduation project, earning him his diploma in 1960 and winning First Prize at the New York Student Film Festival in 1961.
676	Career Film career in the Soviet Union Tarkovsky's first feature film was Ivan's Childhood in 1962.
676	He had inherited the film from director Eduard Abalov, who had to abort the project.
676	The film earned Tarkovsky international acclaim and won the Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival in 1962.
676	In the same year, on September 30, his first son Arseny (called Senka in Tarkovsky's diaries) Tarkovsky was born.
676	In 1965, he directed the film Andrei Rublev about the life of Andrei Rublev, the 15th century Russian icon painter.
676	Andrei Rublev was not immediately released after completion due to problems with Soviet authorities.
676	Tarkovsky had to cut the film several times, resulting in several different versions of varying lengths.
676	A version of the film was presented at the Cannes Film Festival in 1969 and won the FIPRESCI prize.
676	The film was officially released in the Soviet Union in a cut version in 1971.
676	He divorced his wife, Irma Raush, in June 1970.
676	In the same year, he married Larissa Kizilova (née Egorkina), who had been a production assistant for the film Andrei Rublev (they had been living together since 1965).
676	Their son, Andrei Andreyevich Tarkovsky, was born in the same year on August 7.
676	In 1972, he completed Solaris, an adaptation of the novel Solaris by Stanisław Lem.
676	He had worked on this together with screenwriter Fridrikh Gorenshtein as early as 1968.
676	The film was presented at the Cannes Film Festival and won the Grand Prix Spécial du Jury and the FIPRESCI prize and was nominated for the Palme d'Or.
676	From 1973 to 1974, he shot the film The Mirror, a highly autobiographical film drawing on his childhood and incorporating some of his father's poems.
676	Tarkovsky had worked on the screenplay for this film since 1967, under the consecutive titles Confession, White day and A white, white day.
676	From the beginning the film was not well received by Soviet authorities due to its content and its perceived elitist nature.
676	Russian authorities placed the film in the "third category" which meant severe limitations on its distribution, allowing it to be shown only in third class cinemas and workers' clubs.
676	Few prints were made and the filmmakers received no returns.
676	Third category films also placed the filmmakers in danger of being accused of wasting public funds, which could have serious effects on their future productivity.
676	These difficulties are presumed to have made Tarkovsky play with the idea of going abroad and producing a film outside the Soviet film industry.
676	During 1975, Tarkovsky also worked on the screenplay Hoffmanniana, about the German writer and poet E.
676	T.
676	A.
676	Hoffmann.
676	In December 1976, he directed Hamlet, his only stage play, at the Lenkom Theatre in Moscow.
676	The main role was played by Anatoly Solonitsyn, who also acted in several of Tarkovsky's films.
676	At the end of 1978, he also wrote the screenplay Sardor together with the writer Aleksandr Misharin.
676	The last film Tarkovsky completed in the Soviet Union was Stalker, inspired by the novel Roadside Picnic by the brothers Arkady and Boris Strugatsky.
676	Tarkovsky had met the brothers first in 1971 and was in contact with them until his death in 1986.
676	Initially he wanted to shoot a film based on their novel Dead Mountaineer's Hotel and he developed a raw script.
676	Influenced by a discussion with Arkady Strugatsky he changed his plan and began to work on the script based on Roadside Picnic.
676	Work on this film began in 1976.
676	The production was mired in troubles; improper development of the negatives had ruined all the exterior shots.
676	Tarkovsky's relationship with cinematographer Georgy Rerberg deteriorated to the point where Tarkovsky hired Alexander Knyazhinsky as a new first cinematographer.
676	Furthermore, Tarkovsky suffered a heart attack in April 1978, resulting in further delay.
676	The film was completed in 1979 and won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the Cannes Film Festival.
676	In the same year Tarkovsky also began the production of the film The First Day (Russian: Первый День Pervyj Dyen′), based on a script by his friend and longterm collaborator Andrei Konchalovsky.
676	The film was set in 18th Century Russia during the reign of Peter the Great and starred Natalya Bondarchuk and Anatoli Papanov in the main roles.
676	To get the project approved by Goskino, Tarkovsky submitted a script that was different from the original script, leaving out several scenes that were critical of the official atheism in the Soviet Union.
676	After shooting roughly one half of the film the project was stopped by Goskino after it became apparent that the film differed from the script submitted to the censors.
676	Tarkovsky was reportedly infuriated by this interruption and destroyed most of the film.
676	Film career outside the Soviet Union During the summer of 1979, Tarkovsky traveled to Italy, where he shot the documentary Voyage in Time together with his longtime friend Tonino Guerra.
676	Tarkovsky returned to Italy in 1980 for an extended trip during which he and Tonino Guerra completed the script for the film Nostalghia.
676	During 1981 he traveled to the United Kingdom and Swedenthe script for the film Nostalghia.
676	During 1981 he traveled to the.
676	During his trip to Sweden he had considered defecting from the Soviet Union, but ultimately decided to return because of his wife and his son.
676	Tarkovsky returned to Italy in 1982 to start shooting Nostalghia.
676	He did not return to his home country.
676	As Mosfilm withdrew from the project, he had to complete the film with financial support provided by the Italian RAI.
676	Tarkovsky completed the film in 1983.
676	Nostalghia was presented at the Cannes Film Festival and won the FIPRESCI prize and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury.
676	Tarkovsky also shared a special prize called Grand Prix du cinéma de creation with Robert Bresson.
676	Soviet authorities prevented the film from winning the Palme d'Or, a fact that hardened Tarkovsky's resolve to never work in the Soviet Union again.
676	In the same year, he also staged the opera Boris Godunov at the Royal Opera House in London under the musical direction of Claudio Abbado.
676	He spent most of 1984 preparing the film The Sacrifice.
676	At a press conference in Milan on 10 July 1984, he announced that he would never return to the Soviet Union and would remain in the West.
676	At that time, his son Andrei Jr.
676	Soviet Union and not allowed to leave the country.
676	During 1985, he shot the film The Sacrifice in Sweden.
676	At the end of the year he was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.
676	In January 1986, he began treatment in Paris and was joined there by his son, who was finally allowed to leave the Soviet Union.
676	The Sacrifice was presented at the Cannes Film Festival and received the Grand Prix Spécial du Jury, the FIPRESCI prize and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury.
676	As Tarkovsky was unable to attend due to his illness, the prizes were collected by his son, Andrei Jr.
676	In Tarkovsky's last diary entry (15 December 1986), he wrote: "But now I have no strength left — that is the problem".
676	The diaries are sometimes also known as Martyrolog and were published posthumously in 1989 and in English in 1991.
676	Tarkovsky died in Paris on 29 December 1986.
676	His funeral ceremony was held at the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral.
676	He was buried on 3 January 1987 in the Russian Cemetery in Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois in France.
676	The inscription on his grave stone, which was created by the Russian sculptor Ernst Neizvestny, reads: To the man who saw the Angel.
676	A controversy emerged in Russia in the early 1990s when it was alleged that Tarkovsky did not die of natural causes but was assassinated by the KGB.
676	Evidence for this hypothesis includes testimonies by former KGB agents who claim that Viktor Chebrikov gave the order to eradicate Tarkovsky to curtail what the Soviet government and the KGB saw as anti-Soviet propaganda by Tarkovsky.
676	Other evidence includes several memos that surfaced after the 1991 coup and the claim by one of Tarkovsky's doctors that his cancer could not have developed from a natural cause.
676	As Tarkovsky, his wife Larisa Tarkovskaya and actor Anatoli Solonitsyn all died from the very same type of lung cancer, Vladimir Sharun, sound designer in Stalker, is convinced that they were all poisoned when shooting the film near a chemical plant.
676	Filmography Tarkovsky is mainly known as a director of films.
676	During his career he directed only seven feature films and three short films during his time at the film school.
676	He also wrote several screenplays.
676	He furthermore directed the play Hamlet for the stage in Moscow, directed the opera Boris Godunov in London, and he directed a radio production of the short story Turnabout by William Faulkner.
676	He also wrote Sculpting In Time, a book on film theory.
676	Tarkovsky's first feature film was Ivan's Childhood in 1962.
676	He then directed Andrei Rublev in 1966, Solaris in 1972, The Mirror in 1975 and Stalker in 1979.
676	The documentary Voyage in Time was produced in Italy in 1982, as was Nostalghia in 1983.
676	His last film The Sacrifice was produced in Sweden in 1986.
676	Tarkovsky was personally involved in writing the screenplays for all his films, sometimes with a co-writer.
676	To Tarkovsky, a director who realizes somebody else's screenplay without being involved in it becomes a mere illustrator, resulting in dead and monotonous films.
676	Awards Numerous awards were bestowed on Tarkovsky throughout his lifetime.
676	At the Venice Film Festival he was awarded the Golden Lion.
676	At the Cannes Film Festival he won several times the FIPRESCI prize, the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury and the Grand Prix Spécial du Jury.
676	He was also nominated for the Palme d'Or two times.
676	In 1987, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts awarded the BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Language Film to The Sacrifice.
676	Under the influence of Glasnost and Perestroika, Tarkovsky was finally recognized in the Soviet Union in the Autumn of 1986, shortly before his death, by a retrospective of his films in Moscow.
676	After his death, an entire issue of the film magazine Iskusstvo Kino was devoted to Tarkovsky.
676	In their obituaries, the film committee of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Union of Soviet Film Makers expressed their sorrow that Tarkovsky had to spend the last years of his life in exile.
676	Posthumously, he was awarded the Lenin Prize in 1990, one of the highest state honors in the Soviet Union.
676	In 1989 the Andrei Tarkovsky Memorial Prize was established, with its first recipient being the Russian animator Yuriy Norshteyn.
676	Since 1993, the Moscow International Film Festival awards the annual Andrei Tarkovsky Award.
676	In 1996 the Andrei Tarkovsky Museum opened in Yuryevets, his childhood town.
676	A minor planet, 3345 Tarkovskij, discovered by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Georgievna Karachkina in 1982, has also been named after him.
676	Tarkovsky has been the subject of several documentaries.
676	Most notable is the 1988 documentary Moscow Elegy, by Russian film director Alexander Sokurov.
676	Sokurov's own work has been heavily influenced by Tarkovsky.
676	The film consists mostly of narration over stock footage from Tarkovsky's films.
676	Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky is 1988 documentary film by Michal Leszczylowski, an editor of the film The Sacrifice.
676	Film director Chris Marker produced the television documentary One Day in the Life of Andrei Arsenevich as an homage to Andrei Tarkovsky in 2000.
676	Ingmar Bergman was quoted as saying: "Tarkovsky for me is the greatest [of us all], the one who invented a new language, true to the nature of film, as it captures life as a reflection, life as a dream".
676	Film historian Steven Dillon claims that much of subsequent film was deeply influenced by the films of Tarkovsky.
676	At the entrance to the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography in Moscow, Russia there is a monument that includes statues of Tarkovsky, Gennady Shpalikov and Vasily Shukshin.
676	Influences Tarkovsky became a film director during the mid and late 1950s, a period during which Soviet society opened to foreign films, literature and music.
676	This allowed Tarkovsky to see films of European, American and Japanese directors, an experience which influenced his own film making.
676	His teacher and mentor at the film school, Mikhail Romm, allowed his students considerable freedom and emphasized the independence of the film director.
676	Tarkovsky was, according to Shavkat Abdusalmov, a fellow student at the film school, fascinated by Japanese films.
676	He was amazed by how every character on the screen is exceptional and how everyday events such as a Samurai cutting bread with his sword are elevated to something special and put into the limelight.
676	Tarkovsky has also expressed interest in the art of Haiku and its ability to create "images in such a way that they mean nothing beyond themselves."
676	In 1972, Tarkovsky told film historian Leonid Kozlov his ten favorite films.
676	The list includes: Diary of a Country Priest and Mouchette, by Robert Bresson; Winter Light, Wild Strawberries and Persona, by Ingmar Bergman; Nazarín, by Luis Buñuel; City Lights, by Charlie Chaplin; Ugetsu, by Kenji Mizoguchi; Seven Samurai, by Akira Kurosawa, and Woman in the Dunes, by Hiroshi Teshigahara.
676	Among his favorite directors were Buñuel, Mizoguchi, Bergman, Bresson, Kurosawa, Michelangelo Antonioni, Jean Vigo, and Carl Theodor Dreyer.
676	With the exception of City Lights, the list does not contain any films of the early silent era.
676	The reason is that Tarkovsky saw film as an art as only a relatively recent phenomenon, with the early film-making forming only a prelude.
676	The list has also no films or directors from Tarkovsky's native Russia, although he rated Soviet directors such as Boris Barnet, Sergei Paradjanov and Alexander Dovzhenko highly.
676	Although strongly opposed to commercial cinema, in a famous exception Tarkovsky praised the blockbuster film The Terminator, saying its "vision of the future and the relation between man and its destiny is pushing the frontier of cinema as an art".
676	He was critical of the "brutality and low acting skills", but nevertheless impressed by this film.
676	Cinematic style Tarkovsky's films are characterised by metaphysical themes, extremely long takes, and memorable images of exceptional beauty.
676	Recurring motifs are dreams, memory, childhood, running water accompanied by fire, rain indoors, reflections, levitation, and characters re-appearing in the foreground of long panning movements of the camera.
676	He once said, “Juxtaposing a person with an environment that is boundless, collating him with a countless number of people passing by close to him and far away, relating a person to the whole world, that is the meaning of cinema.” Tarkovsky included levitation scenes into several of his films, most notably Solaris.
676	To him these scenes possess great power and are used for their photogenic value and magical inexplicability.
676	Water, clouds, and reflections were used by him for their surreal beauty and photogenic value, as well as their symbolism, such as waves or the forms of brooks or running water.
676	Bells and candles are also frequent symbols.
676	These are symbols of film, sight and sound, and Tarkovsky's film frequently has themes of self-reflection.
676	Tarkovsky developed a theory of cinema that he called "sculpting in time".
676	By this he meant that the unique characteristic of cinema as a medium was to take our experience of time and alter it.
676	Unedited movie footage transcribes time in real time.
676	By using long takes and few cuts in his films, he aimed to give the viewers a sense of time passing, time lost, and the relationship of one moment in time to another.
676	Up to, and including, his film Thship of one moment in time to ane Mirror, Tarkovsky focused his cinematic works on exploring this theory.
676	After The Mirror, he announced that he would focus his work on exploring the dramatic unities proposed by Aristotle: a concentrated action, happening in one place, within the span of a single day.
676	Several of Tarkovsky's films have color or black and white sequences, including for example Andrei Rublev which features an epilogue in color of religious icon paintings, as well as Solaris, The Mirror, and Stalker, which feature monochrome and sepia sequences while otherwise being in color.
676	In 1966, in an interview conducted shortly after finishing Andrei Rublev, Tarkovsky dismissed color film as a "commercial gimmick" and cast doubt on the idea that contemporary films meaningfully use color.
676	He claimed that in everyday life one does not consciously notice colors most of the time.
676	Hence in film color should be used mainly to emphasize certain moments, but not all the time as this distracts the viewer.
676	To him, films in color are like moving paintings or photographs, which are too beautiful to be a realistic depiction of life.
676	Vadim Yusov Tarkovsky worked in close collaboration with cinematographer Vadim Yusov, and much of the visual style of Tarkovsky's films can be attributed to this collaboration.
676	Tarkovsky would spend two days preparing for Yusov to film a single long take, and due to the preparation, usually only a single take was needed.
676	Sven Nykvist In his last film, The Sacrifice, Tarkovsky worked with cinematographer Sven Nykvist, who had worked closely with director Ingmar Bergman on many of Bergman's films.
676	Nykvist complained that Tarkovsky would frequently look through the camera and even direct actors through it.

677	Ambiguity of information, in words, pictures, or other media, is the ability to express more than one interpretation.
677	It is generally contrasted with vagueness, in that specific and distinct interpretations are permitted (although some may not be immediately apparent), whereas with information that is vague it is difficult to form any interpretation at the desired level of specificity.
677	Context may play a role in resolving ambiguity.
677	For example, the same piece of information may be ambiguous in one context and unambiguous in another.
677	Linguistic forms  The lexical ambiguity of a word or phrase pertains to its having more than one meaning in the language to which the word belongs.
677	"Meaning" hereby refers to whatever should be captured by a good dictionary.
677	For instance, the word "bank" has several distinct lexical definitions, including "financial institution" and "edge of a river".
677	Another example is as in "apothecary".
677	One could say "I bought herbs from the apothecary".
677	This could mean one actually spoke to the apothecary (pharmacist) or went to the apothecary (pharmacy).
677	The context in which an ambiguous word is used often makes it evident which of the meanings is intended.
677	If, for instance, someone says "I buried $100 in the bank", most people would not think someone used a shovel to dig in the mud.
677	However, some linguistic contexts do not provide sufficient information to disambiguate a used word.
677	For example,  Lexical ambiguity can be addressed by algorithmic methods that automatically associate the appropriate meaning with a word in context, a task referred to as word sense disambiguation.
677	The use of multi-defined words requires the author or speaker to clarify their context, and sometimes elaborate on their specific intended meaning (in which case, a less ambiguous term should have been used).
677	The goal of clear concise communication is that the receiver(s) have no misunderstanding about what was meant to be conveyed.
677	An exception to this could include a politician whose "weasel words" and obfuscation are necessary to gain support from multiple constituents with mutually exclusive conflicting desires from their candidate of choice.
677	Ambiguity is a powerful tool of political science.
677	More problematic are words whose senses express closely related concepts.
677	"Good", for example, can mean "useful" or "functional" (That's a good hammer), "exemplary" (She's a good student), "pleasing" (This is good soup), "moral (a good person versus the lesson to be learned from a story), "righteous", etc.
677	" I have a good daughter" is not clear about which sense is intended.
677	The various ways to apply prefixes and suffixes can also create ambiguity ("unlockable" can mean "capable of being unlocked" or "impossible to lock").
677	Syntactic ambiguity arises when a sentence can have two (or more) different meanings because of the structure of the sentence—its syntax.
677	This is often due to a modifying expression, such as a prepositional phrase, the application of which is unclear.
677	"He ate the cookies on the couch", for example, could mean that he ate those cookies that were on the couch (as opposed to those that were on the table), or it could mean that he was sitting on the couch when he ate the cookies.
677	"To get in, you will need an entrance fee of $10 or your voucher and your drivers' license."
677	This could mean that you need EITHER ten dollars OR BOTH your voucher and your license.
677	Or it could mean that you need EITHER ten dollars OR a voucher AND you also need your license.
677	Only rewriting the sentence, or placing appropriate punctuation can resolve a syntactic ambiguity.
677	Spoken language can contain many more types of ambiguities, where there is more than one way to compose a set of sounds into words, for example "ice cream" and "I scream".
677	Such ambiguity is generally resolved according to the context.
677	A mishearing of such, based on incorrectly resolved ambiguity, is called a mondegreen.
677	Semantic ambiguity happens when a sentence contains an ambiguous word or phrase—a word or phrase that has more than one meaning.
677	"We saw her duck" (example due to Richard Nordquist).
677	The word "duck" can refer to the person's bird or to a motion she made.
677	For example, "You could do with a new automobile.
677	How about a test drive?"
677	The clause "You could do with" presents a statement with such wide possible interpretation as to be essentially meaningless.
677	Lexical ambiguity is contrasted with semantic ambiguity.
677	The former represents a choice between a finite number of known and meaningful context-dependent interpretations.
677	The latter represents a choice between any number of possible interpretations, none of which may have a standard agreed-upon meaning.
677	This form of ambiguity is closely related to vagueness.
677	Linguistic ambiguity can be a problem in law, because the interpretation of written documents and oral agreements is often of paramount importance.
677	Intentional application Philosophers (and other users of logic) spend a lot of time and effort searching for and removing (or intentionally adding) ambiguity in arguments, because it can lead to incorrect conclusions and can be used to deliberately conceal bad arguments.
677	For example, a politician might say "I oppose taxes which hinder economic growth", an example of a glittering generality.
677	Some will think he opposes taxes in general, because they hinder economic growth.
677	Others may think he opposes only those taxes that he believes will hinder economic growth.
677	In writing, the sentence can be rewritten to reduce possible misinterpretation, either by adding a comma after "taxes" (to convey the first sense) or by changing "which" to "that" (to convey the second sense), or by rewriting it in other ways.
677	The devious politician hopes that each constituent will interpret the statement in the most desirable way, and think the politician supports everyone's opinion.
677	However, the opposite can also be true - An opponent can turn a positive statement into a bad one, if the speaker uses ambiguity (intentionally or not).
677	The logical fallacies of amphiboly and equivocation rely heavily on tintentionallhe use of ambiguous words and phrases.
677	In Continental philosophy (particularly phenomenology and existentialism), there is much greater tolerance of ambiguity, as it is generally seen as an integral part of the human condition.
677	Martin Heidegger argued that the relation between the subject and object is ambiguous, as is the relation of mind and body, and part and whole.
677	In Heidegger's phenomenology, Dasein is always in a meaningful world, but there is always an underlying background for every instance of signification.
677	Thus, although some things may be certain, they have little to do with Dasein's sense of care and existential anxiety, e.g., in the face of death.
677	In calling his work Being and Nothingness an "essay in phenomenological ontology" Jean-Paul Sartre follows Heidegger in defining the human essence as ambiguous, or relating fundamentally to such ambiguity.
677	Simone de Beauvoir tries to base an ethics on Heidegger's and Sartre's writings (The Ethics of Ambiguity), where she highlights the need to grapple with ambiguity: "as long as philosophers and they [men] have thought, most of them have tried to mask it...And the ethics which they have proposed to their disciples has always pursued thre same goal.
677	It has been a matter of eliminating the ambiguity by making oneself pure inwardness or pure externality, by escaping from the sensible world or being engulfed by it, by yielding to eternity or enclosing oneself in the pure moment.".
677	Ethics cannot be based on the authoritative certainty given by mathematics and logic, or prescribed directly from the empirical findings of science.
677	She states: "Since we do not succeed in fleeing it, let us therefore try to look the truth in the face.
677	Let us try to assume our fundamental ambiguity.
677	It is in the knowledge of the genuine conditions of our life that we must draw our strength to live and our reason for acting".
677	Other continental philosophers suggest that concepts such as life, nature, and sex are ambiguous.
677	Recently, Corey Anton has argued that we cannot be certain what is separate from or unified with something else: language, he asserts, divides what is not in fact separate.
677	Following Ernest Becker, he argues that the desire to 'authoritatively disambiguate' the world and existence has led to numerous ideologies and historical events such as genocide.
677	On this basis, he argues that ethics must focus on 'dialectically integrating opposites' and balancing tension, rather than seeking a priori validation or certainty.
677	Like the existentialists and phenomenologists, he sees the ambiguity of life as the basis of creativity.
677	In literature and rhetoric, ambiguity can be a useful tool.
677	Groucho Marx's classic joke depends on a grammatical ambiguity for its humor, for example: "Last night I shot an elephant in my pajamas.
677	How he got in my pajamas, I'll never know".
677	Songs and poetry often rely on ambiguous words for artistic effect, as in the song title "Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue" (where "blue" can refer to the color, or to sadness).
677	In narrative, ambiguity can be introduced in several ways: motive, plot, character.
677	F.
677	Scott Fitzgerald uses the latter type of ambiguity with notable effect in his novel The Great Gatsby.
677	All religions debate the orthodoxy or heterodoxy of ambiguity.
677	Christianity and Judaism employ the concept of paradox synonymously with 'ambiguity'.
677	Ambiguity within Christianity (and other religions) is resisted by the conservatives and fundamentalists, who regard the concept as equating with 'contradiction'.
677	Non-fundamentalist Christians and Jews endorse Rudolf Otto's description of the sacred as 'mysterium tremendum et fascinans', the awe-inspiring mystery which fascinates humans..
677	Metonymy involves the use of the name of a subcomponent part as an abbreviation, or jargon, for the name of the whole object (for example "wheels" to refer to a car, or "flowers" to refer to beautiful offspring, an entire plant, or a collection of blooming plants).
677	In modern vocabulary critical semiotics, metonymy encompasses any potentially ambiguous word substitution that is based on contextual contiguity (located close together), or a function or process that an object performs, such as "sweet ride" to refer to a nice car.
677	Metonym miscommunication is considered a primary mechanism of linguistic humour.
677	Psychology and management In sociology and social psychology, the term "ambiguity" is used to indicate situations that involve uncertainty.
677	An increasing amount of research is concentrating on how people react and respond to ambiguous situations.
677	Much of this focuses on ambiguity tolerance.
677	A number of correlations have been found between an individual's reaction and tolerance to ambiguity and a range of factors.
677	Apter and Desselles (2001) for example, found a strong correlation with such attributes and factors like a greater preference for safe as opposed to risk-based sports, a preference for endurance-type activities as opposed to explosive activities, a more organized and less casual lifestyle, greater care and precision in descriptions, a lower sensitivity to emotional and unpleasant words, a less acute sense of humor, engaging a smaller variety of sexual practices than their more risk-comfortable colleagues, a lower likelihood of the use of drugs, pornography and drink, a greater likelihood of displaying obsessional behavior.
677	In the field of leadership, David Wilkinson (2006) found strong correlations between an individual leader's reaction to ambiguous situations and the Modes of Leadership they use, the type of creativity, Kirton (2003) and how they relate to others.
677	Music In music, pieces or sections which confound expectations and may be or are interpreted simultaneously in different ways are ambiguous, such as some polytonality, polymeter, other ambiguous meters or rhythms, and ambiguous phrasing, or (Stein 2005, p. 79) any rs or aspect of music.
677	The music of Africa is often purposely ambiguous.
677	To quote Sir Donald Francis Tovey (1935, p. 195), "Theorists are apt to vex themselves with vain efforts to remove uncertainty just where it has a high aesthetic value."
677	Visual art  In visual art, certain images are visually ambiguous, such as the Necker cube, which can be interpreted in two ways.
677	Perceptions of such objects remain stable for a time, then may flip, a phenomenon called multistable perception.
677	The opposite of such ambiguous images are impossible objects.
677	Pictures or photographs may also be ambiguous at the semantic level: the visual image is unambiguous, but the meaning and narrative may be ambiguous: is a certain facial expression one of excitement or fear, for instance?
677	Constructed language Some languages have been created with the intention of avoiding ambiguity, especially lexical ambiguity.
677	Lojban and Loglan are two related languages which have been created with this in mind, focusing chiefly on syntactic ambiguity as well.
677	The languages can be both spoken and written.
677	These languages are intended to provide a greater technical precision over big natural languages, although historically, such attempts at language improvement have been criticized.
677	Languages composed from many diverse sources contain much ambiguity and inconsistency.
677	The many exceptions to syntax and semantic rules are time-consuming and difficult to learn.
677	Mathematical notation Mathematical notation, widely used in physics and other sciences, avoids many ambiguities compared to expression in natural language.
677	However, for various reasons, several lexical, syntactic and semantic ambiguities remain.
677	Names of functions The ambiguity in the style of writing a function should not be confused with a multivalued function, which can (and should) be defined in a deterministic and unambiguous way.
677	Several special functions still do not have established notations.
677	Usually, the conversion to another notation requires to scale the argument and/or the resulting value; sometimes, the same name of the function is used, causing confusions.
677	Examples of such underestablished functions: * Sinc function * Elliptic integral of the third kind; translating elliptic integral form MAPLE to Mathematica, one should replace the second argument to its square, see Talk:Elliptic integral#List of notations; dealing with complex values, this may cause problems.
677	Exponential integral, * Hermite polynomial, Expressions Ambiguous expressions often appear in physical and mathematical texts.
677	It is common practice to omit multiplication signs in mathematical expressions.
677	Also, it is common to give the same name to a variable and a function, for example, .
677	Then, if one sees , there is no way to distinguish whether it means  multiplied by , or function  evaluated at argument equal to .
677	In each case of use of such notations, the reader is supposed to be able to perform the deduction and reveal the true meaning.
677	Creators of algorithmic languages try to avoid ambiguities.
677	Many algorithmic languages (C++ and Fortran) require the character * as symbol of multiplication.
677	The language Mathematica allows the user to omit the multiplication symbol, but requires square brackets to indicate the argument of a function; square brackets are not allowed for grouping of expressions.
677	Fortran, in addition, does not allow use of the same name (identifier) for different objects, for example, function and variable; in particular, the expression f=f(x) is qualified as an error.
677	The order of operations may depend on the context.
677	In most programming languages, the operations of division and multiplication have equal priority and are executed from left to right.
677	Until the last century, many editorials assumed that multiplication is performed first, for example,  is interpreted as ; in this case, the insertion of parentheses is required when translating the formulas to an algorithmic language.
677	In addition, it is common to write an argument of a function without parenthesis, which also may lead to ambiguity.
677	Sometimes, one uses italics letters to denote elementary functions.
677	In the scientific journal style, the expression means product of variables , ,  and , although in a slideshow, it may mean .
677	A comma in subscripts and superscripts sometimes is omitted; it is also ambiguous notation.
677	If it is written , the reader should guess from the context, does it mean a single-index object, evaluated while the subscript is equal to product of variables ,  and , or it is indication to a trivalent tensor.
677	The writing of  instead of  may mean that the writer either is stretched in space (for example, to reduce the publication fees) or aims to increase number of publications without considering readers.
677	The same may apply to any other use of ambiguous notations.
677	Subscripts are also used to denote the argument to a function, as in .
677	Examples of potentially confusing ambiguous mathematical expressions  , which could be understood to mean either  or .
677	In addition,  may mean , as  means  (see tetration).
677	Notations in quantum optics and quantum mechanics It is common to define the coherent states in quantum optics with  and states with fixed number of photons with .
677	Then, there is an "unwritten rule": the state is coherent if there are gle~<more Greek characters than Latin characters in the argument, and photon state if the Latin characters dominate.
677	The ambiguity becomes even worse, if  is used for the states with certain value of the coordinate, and  means the state with certain value of the momentum, which may be used in books on quantum mechanics.
677	Such ambiguities easy lead to confusions, especially if some normalized adimensional, dimensionless variables are used.
677	Expression  may mean a state with single photon, or the coherent state with mean amplitude equal to 1, or state with momentum equal to unity, and so on.
677	The reader is supposed to guess from the context.
677	Ambiguous terms in physics and mathematics Some physical quantities do not yet have established notations; their value (and sometimes even dimension, as in the case of the Einstein coefficients), depends on the system of notations.
677	Many terms are ambiguous.
677	Each use of an ambiguous term should be preceded by the definition, suitable for a specific case.
677	Just like Ludwig Wittgenstein states in Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus: "...
677	Only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning."
677	A highly confusing term is gain.
677	For example, the sentence "the gain of a system should be doubled", without context, means close to nothing.
677	It may mean that the ratio of the output voltage of an electric circuit to the input voltage should be doubled.
677	It may mean that the ratio of the output power of an electric or optical circuit to the input power should be doubled.
677	It may mean that the gain of the laser medium should be doubled, for example, doubling the population of the upper laser level in a quasi-two level system (assuming negligible absorption of the ground-state).
677	The term intensity is ambiguous when applied to light.
677	The term can refer to any of irradiance, luminous intensity, radiant intensity, or radiance, depending on the background of the person using the term.
677	Also, confusions may be related with the use of atomic percent as measure of concentration of a dopant, or resolution of an imaging system, as measure of the size of the smallest detail which still can be resolved at the background of statistical noise.
677	See also Accuracy and precision and its talk.
677	The Berry paradox arises as a result of systematic ambiguity in the meaning of terms such as "definable" or "nameable".
677	Terms of this kind give rise to vicious circle fallacies.
677	Other terms with this type of ambiguity are: satisfiable, true, false, function, property, class, relation, cardinal, and ordinal.
677	Mathematical interpretation of ambiguity In mathematics and logic, ambiguity can be considered to be an underdetermined system (of equations or logic) – for example,  leaves open what the value of X is – while its opposite is a self-contradiction, also called inconsistency, paradoxicalness, or oxymoron, in an overdetermined system – such as , which has no solution – see also underdetermination.
677	Logical ambiguity and self-contradiction is analogous to visual ambiguity and impossible objects, such as the Necker cube and impossible cube, or many of the drawings of M.
677	C.
677	Escher.
677	Pedagogic use of ambiguous expressions Ambiguity can be used as a pedagogical trick, to force students to reproduce the deduction by themselves.
677	Some textbooks give the same name to the function and to its Fourier transform: .
677	Rigorously speaking, such an expression requires that ; even if function  is a self-Fourier function, the expression should be written as ; however, it is assumed that the shape of the function  (and even its norm ) depend on the character used to denote its argument.
677	If the Greek letter is used, it is assumed to be a Fourier transform of another function, The first function is assumed, if the expression in the argument contains more characters  or , than characters , and the second function is assumed in the opposite case.
677	Expressions like  or  contain symbols  and  in equal amounts; they are ambiguous and should be avoided in serious deduction.
679	An animal is a taxonomic member of the Kingdom Animalia.
679	For biologists, this includes human beings, although for the general public the term "animal" means only non-human animals.

680	The aardvark ( , Orycteropus afer) is a medium-sized, burrowing, nocturnal mammal native to Africa.
680	It is the only living species of the order Tubulidentata, although other prehistoric species and genera of Tubulidentata are known.
680	Naming and taxonomy It is sometimes colloquially called "antbear", "anteater", or the "Cape anteater" after the Cape of Good Hope.
680	The name comes from earlier Afrikaans and means "earth pig" or "ground pig" (aarde earth/ground, varken pig), because of its burrowing habits (similar origin to the name groundhog).
680	The aardvark is not closely related to the pig; rather, it is the sole recent representative of the obscure mammalian order Tubulidentata, in which it is usually considered to form one variable species of the genus Orycteropus, the sole surviving genus in the family Orycteropodidae.
680	The aardvark is not closely related to the South American anteater, despite sharing some characteristics and a superficial resemblance.
680	The closest living relatives of the aardvark are the elephant shrews, along with the sirenians, hyraxes, tenrecs, and elephants.
680	With their extinct relatives, these animals form the superorder Afrotheria.
680	The scientific name of the aardvark comes from Greek ορυκτερόπους (orykterópous) meaning "digging footed" and afer: from Africa.
680	Description The aardvark is vaguely pig-like in appearance.
680	Its body is stout with an arched back and is sparsely covered with coarse hairs.
680	The limbs are of moderate length.
680	The front feet have lost the pollex (or 'thumb'), resulting in four toes, while the rear feet have all five toes.
680	Each toe bears a large, robust nail which is somewhat flattened and shovel-like, and appears to be intermediate between a claw and a hoof.
680	The ears are disproportionately long, and the tail is very thick at the base and gradually tapers.
680	The greatly elongated head is set on a short, thick neck, and the end of the snout bears a disc, which houses the nostrils.
680	The mouth is small and tubular, typical of species that feed on ants and termites.
680	The aardvark has a long, thin, snakelike, protruding tongue and elaborate structures supporting a keen sense of smell.
680	An aardvark's weight is typically between 40 and(-).
680	An aardvark's length is usually between 1 and(-), and can reach lengths of  when its tail (which can be up to 70 cm) is taken into account.
680	It is the largest member of the proposed clade Afroinsectiphilia.
680	The aardvark is pale yellowish-gray in color and often stained reddish-brown by soil.
680	The aardvark's coat is thin, and the animal's primary protection is its tough skin.
680	The aardvark has been known to sleep in a recently excavated ant nest, which also serves as protection from its predators.
680	One of the most distinctive characteristics of the Tubulidentata is their teeth.
680	Instead of having a pulp cavity, each tooth has a cluster of thin, upright, parallel tubes of vasodentin (a modified form of dentine), with individual pulp canals, held together by cementum.
680	The teeth have no enamel coating and are worn away and regrow continuously.
680	The aardvark is born with conventional incisors and canines at the front of the jaw, which fall out and are not replaced.
680	Adult aardvarks have only cheek teeth at the back of the jaw, and have a dental formula of:  These remaining teeth are peg-like and rootless and are of unique composition.
680	Genetically speaking, the aardvark is a living fossil, as its chromosomes are highly conserved, reflecting much of the early eutherian arrangement before the divergence of the major modern taxa.
680	Ecology and behavior Aardvarks live in sub-Saharan Africa, where there is suitable habitat for them to live, such as savannas, grasslands, woodlands and bushland, and available food (i.e., ants and termites).
680	The aardvark is nocturnal and is a solitary creature that feeds almost exclusively on ants and termites (formicivore); the only fruit eaten by aardvarks is the aardvark cucumber.
680	An aardvark emerges from its burrow in the late afternoon or shortly after sunset, and forages over a considerable home range encompassing 10 to 30 km, swinging its long nose from side to side to pick up the scent of food.
680	When a concentration of ants or termites is detected, the aardvark digs into it with its powerful front legs, keeping its long ears upright to listen for predators, and takes up an astonishing number of insects with its long, sticky tongue—as many as 50,000 in one night have been recorded.
680	It can dig 2 feet in 15 seconds, but otherwise moves fairly slowly.
680	Its claws enable it to dig through the extremely hard crust of a termite or ant mound quickly, avoiding the dust by sealing the nostrils.
680	When successful, the aardvark's long (up to 30 cm) tongue licks up the insects; the termites' biting, or the ants' stinging attacks are rendered futile by the tough skin.
680	Its keen hearing warns it of predators: lions, leopards, hyenas, and pythons.
680	Aside from digging out ants and termites, the aardvark also excavates burrows in which to live; temporary sites are scattered around the home range as refuges, and a main burrow is used for breeding.
680	Main burrows can be deep and extensive, have several entrances and can be as long as 13 m.
680	The aardvark changes the layout of its home burrow regularly, and from time to time moves on a/> The aardvark changes thend makes a new one; the old burrows are then inhabited by smaller animals like the African wild dog.
680	Only mothers and young share burrows.
680	If attacked in the tunnel, it will seal the tunnel off behind itself or turn around and attack with its claws.
680	Aardvarks pair only during the breeding season; after a gestation period of seven months, one cub weighing around 2 kg is born, and is able to leave the burrow to accompany its mother after only two weeks, and is eating termites at 14 weeks and is weaned by 16 weeks.
680	At six months of age it is able to dig its own burrows, but it will often remain with the mother until the next mating season, and is sexually capable by the season after that.
680	Aardvarks live for up to 24 years in captivity.
680	The aardvark's main predators are lions, leopards, hunting dogs and pythons.
680	Some African tribes also hunt aardvarks for meat.
680	Aardvarks can dig fast or run in zigzag fashion to elude enemies, but if all else fails, they will strike with their claws, tail and shoulders, sometimes flipping onto their backs to lash with all fours.
680	Their thick skin also protects them to some extent.
680	Mythology and popular culture In African folklore, the aardvark is much admired because of its diligent quest for food and its fearless response to soldier ants.
680	Hausa magicians make a charm from the heart, skin, forehead, and nails of the aardvark, which they then proceed to pound together with the root of a certain tree.
680	Wrapped in a piece of skin and worn on the chest, the charm is said to give the owner the ability to pass through walls or roofs at night.
680	The charm is said to be used by burglars and those seeking to visit young girls without their parents' permission.
680	The Egyptian god Set is said (by some) to have the head of an aardvark or to be part aardvark.
680	The titular character of Arthur, an animated television series for children based on a book series and produced by WGBH, shown in more than 180 countries, is an aardvark.
681	The aardwolf (Proteles cristata) is a small, insectivorous mammal, native to East Africa and Southern Africa.
681	Its name means "earth wolf" in the Afrikaans / Dutch language.
681	It is also called "maanhaar jackal".
681	The aardwolf is in the same family as the hyenas.
681	Unlike its relatives, the aardwolf does not hunt large animals; instead it eats insects, mainly termites - one aardwolf can eat about 200,000 termites during a single night by using its long, sticky tongue to capture them.
681	The aardwolf is the only surviving species in the mammalian subfamily Protelinae.
681	There are two subspecies: Proteles cristatus cristatus of Southern Africa and Proteles cristatus septentrionalis of East Africa.
681	The aardwolf is usually classified with the Hyaenidae, though it wasthe Hyaenid formerly placed into the family Protelidae.
681	The aardwolf lives in the scrublands of eastern and southern Africa - these are open lands covered with stunted trees and shrubs.
681	Aardwolves usually hide in burrows during the day, and then they come out at night to seek food.
681	Their diet nearly always consists of termites, insect larvae, and the carrion of larger animals.
681	Physical characteristics The aardwolf resembles a very small Striped Hyena, but with a more slender muzzle, sharper ears, black vertical stripes on a coat of yellowish fur, and a long, distinct mane down the midline of the neck and back.
681	The mane is raised during confrontations in order to make the aardwolves appear larger.
681	The aardwolf is about 55 to 80 centimeters long, excluding its bushy tail, which is about 20 to 30 cm long, and stands about 40 to 50 cm tall at the shoulders.
681	An adult aardwolf weighs between 9 and 14 kilograms.
681	The front feet have five toes each, unlike the four-toed hyena.
681	The teeth and skull are similar to those of the hyena, though its cheek teeth are specialised for eating insects.
681	As the aardwolf ages, it will normally lose some of its teeth, though this has little impact on their feeding habits due to the softness of the insects that they eat.
681	The aardwolf has two anal glands that secrete a musky fluid for marking territory and for communicating with other aardwolves.
681	Distribution and habitat Aardwolves live in open, dry plains and bushland, avoiding mountainous areas.
681	Due to specific food requirements, they are only found in regions where termites of the family Hodotermitidae occur.
681	Termites of this family depend on dead and withered grass and are most populous in heavily grazed grasslands and savannahs, including farmland.
681	For most of the year, aardwolves spend time in shared territories consisting of up to a dozen dens, which are occupied for six weeks at a time.
681	There are two distinct populations: one in Southern Africa, and another in East and Northeast Africa.
681	The species does not occur in the intermediary miombo forests.
681	Behavior Aardwolves are shy and nocturnal, sleeping in underground burrows by day.
681	They usually use existing burrows of aardvarks, porcupines or springhares, despite being capable of creating their own.
681	By night, an aardwolf can consume up to 200,000 harvester termites using its sticky, long tongue.
681	They take special care not to destroy the termite mound or consume the entire colony, which ensures that the termites can rebuild and provide a continuous supply of food.
681	They will often memorise the location of such nests and return to them to save the trouble of finding a new one.
681	They are also known to feed on other insects, larvae, and eggs, and occasionally small mammals and birds.
681	Unlike other hyenas, aardwolves do not scavenge or kill larger animals.
681	The adult aardwolf is primarily solitary while foraging for food, necessary because of the scarcity and homogeneous distribution of their insect prey.
681	They have often been mistaken for solitary animals.
681	In fact, they live as monogamous pairs with their young, defending the same territory.
681	Young aardwolves generally achieve sexual maturity at two years of age.
681	The breeding season varies depending on their location, but normally takes place during autumn or spring.
681	During the breeding season, unpaired male aardwolves will search their own territory, as well as others', for a female to mate with.
681	Dominant males will also mate opportunistically with the females of less dominant neighboring aardwolves.
681	This can often result in conflict between two male aardwolves when one has wandered into another's territory.
681	Gestation lasts between 90 and 110 days, producing one to five cubs (most often two or three) during the rainy season, when termites are active.
681	The first six to eight weeks are spent in the den with the mother.
681	After three months, they begin supervised foraging and by four months are normally independent, though they will often share a den with their mother until the next breeding season.
681	They can achieve a lifespan of up to 15 years when in captivity.
681	Interaction with humans Agriculture may create a negative impact on their population due to use of poisons by farmers.
681	They are often considered useful, non-dangerous animals by farmers.
681	However, in some areas the aardwolf is hunted for its fur.
681	Encounters with dogs are another threat.
682	Adobe (,; Arabic: الطوب) is a natural building material made from [etrieved 25 December [sand, clay, water,  and some kind of fibrous or organic material (sticks, straw, and/or manure), which the builders shape into bricks (using frames) and dry in the sun.
682	Adobe buildings are similar to cob and mudbrick buildings.
682	Adobe structures are extremely durable, and account for some of the oldest existing buildings in the world.
682	In hot climates, compared with wooden buildings, adobe buildings offer significant advantages due to their greater thermal mass, but they are known to be particularly susceptible to earthquake damage.
682	Buildings made of sun-dried earth are common in West Asia, North Africa, West Africa, South America, southwestern North America,  Spain (usually in the Mudéjar style), Eastern Europe and East Anglia, particularly Norfolk, known as 'clay lump.
682	Adobe had been in use by indigenous peoples of the Americas in the Southwestern United States, Mesoamerica, and the Andean region of South America for several thousand years, although often substantial amounts of stone are used in the walls of Pueblo buildings.
682	Also, the Pueblo people built their adobe structures with handsful or basketsful of adobe, until the Spanish introduced them to the making of bricks.) Adobe brickmaking was used in Spain starting by the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age, from the eighth century B.C.
682	Its wide use can be attributed to its simplicity of design and manufacture, and the economy of creating it.
682	A distinction is sometimes made between the smaller adobes, which are about the size of ordinary baked bricks, and the larger adobines, some of which may be one to two yards (1–2 m) long.
682	Etymology The word adobe has existed for around 4,000 years, with relatively little change in either pronunciation or meaning.
682	The word can be traced from the Middle Egyptian (c.
682	BC) word dj-b-t "mud [i.e., sun-dried] brick."
682	As Middle Egyptian evolved into Late Egyptian, Demotic, and finally Coptic (c.
682	BC), dj-b-t became tobe "[mud] brick."
682	This was borrowed into Arabic as al-tub (الطّوب al "the" + tub "brick") "[mud] brick," which was assimilated into Old Spanish as adobe, still with the meaning "mud brick."
682	English borrowed the word from Spanish in the early 18th century.
682	In more modern English usage, the term "adobe" has come to include a style of architecture popular in the desert climates of North America, especially in New Mexico.
682	Compare with stucco).
682	Composition An adobe brick is a composite material made of clay mixed with water and an organic material such as straw or dung.
682	The soil composition typically contains clay and sand.
682	Straw is useful in binding the brick together and allowing the brick to dry evenly, thereby preventing cracking due to uneven shrinkage rates through the brick.
682	Dung offers the same advantage and is also added to repel insects.
682	The most desirable soil texture for producing the mud of adobe is 15% clay, 10-30% silt and 55-75% fine sand.
682	Another source quotes 15-25% clay and the remainder sand and coarser particles up to cobbles 2-10 inches with no deleterious effect.
682	Modern adobe is stabilized with either emulsified asphalt or portland cement up to 10% by weight.
682	The clay content should be a mixture of no more that half expansive clays with the remainder non-expansive illite or kaolinite.
682	Too much expansive clay results in uneven drying through the brick and cracking while too much kaolinite will make a weak brick.
682	Typically the soils of the Southwest United States where such construction is use, are an adequate composition.
682	Adobe bricks Bricks are made in an open frame, 25 cm by 36 cm being a reasonable size, but any convenient size is acceptable.
682	The mixture is molded into a frame, and then the frame is removed after initial setting.
682	After drying a few hours, the bricks are turned on edge to finish drying.
682	Slow drying in shade reduces cracking.
682	The same mixture used to make bricks, but without straw, is used for mortar and often for plaster on interior and exterior walls.
682	Some ancient cultures used lime-based cement for the plaster to protect against rain damage.
682	The brick’s thickness is preferred partially due to its thermal characteristics, and partially due to the stability of a thicker brick versus a more standard-sized brick.
682	Depending on the form into which the mixture is pressed, adobe can encompass nearly any shape or size, provided drying is even and the mixture includes reinforcement for larger bricks.
682	Reinforcement can include manure, straw, cement, rebar or wooden posts.
682	Experience has shown straw, cement, or manure added to a standard adobe mixture can all produce a stronger, more crack-resistant brick.
682	A general testing is done on the soil content first.
682	To do so, a sample of the soil is mixed into a clear container with some water, creating an almost completely saturated liquid.
682	After it is sealed, the container is shaken vigorously for at least one minute.
682	It is then allowed to sit on a flat surface for a day or so until the soil has settled into layers or remains in suspension.
682	Heavier particles settle out first, so gravel will be on the bottom, sand above, silt above that and very fine clay and organic matter will stay in suspension for days.
682	After the water has cleared, percentages of the various particles can be determined.
682	Fifty to 60 percent sand and 35 to 40 percent clay will yield strong bricks.
682	The New Mexico State University  Extension Service recommends a mix of not more than 1/3 clay, not less than 1/2 sand, and never more than 1/3 silt.
682	Material properties Adobe walls are load bearing, i.e.
682	In the United States the most building [http://quentinwilson.squarespace.com/storage/adobecode.pdf codes] call for a minimum compressive strength of 300 lbf/in.2 Adobe construction should be designed so as to avoid lateral structural loads that would cause bending loads.
682	The building codes require the building sustain a 1 g lateral acceleration earthquake load.
682	Such a acceleration will cause lateral loads on the walls, resulting in shear and bending and inducing tensile stresses.
682	To withstand such loads, the codes typically call for a tensile modulus of rupture strength of at least 50 lbf/in.2 In addition to being an inexpensive material with a small resource cost, adobe can serve as a significant heat reservoir due to the thermal properties inherent in the massive walls typical in adobe construction.
682	In climates typified by hot days and cool nights, the high thermal mass of adobe averages out the high and low temperatures of the day, moderating the living space temperature.
682	The massive walls require a large and relatively long input of heat from the sun (radiation) and from the surrounding air (convection) before they warm through to the interior.
682	After the sun sets and the temperature drops, the warm wall will then continue to transfer heat to the interior for several hours due to the time lag effect.
682	Thus, a well-planned adobe wall of the appropriate thickness is very effective at controlling inside temperature through the wide daily fluctuations typical of desert climates, a factor which has contributed to its longevity as a building material.
682	Thermodynamic material properties are sparsely quoted.
682	The thermal conductivity of adobe is quoted as as having an R value of R0 0.41 hr*ft2*°F/(Btu*in).[http://www.emnrd.state.nm.us/ECMD/FORMS/documents/MANUAL2.1.pdf] To determine the total R value, multiply R0, by the thickness of the adobe wall.
682	From that, the conductivity is found to be k   0.20 Btu/(hr*ft*°F) or 0.35 W/(m*K).
682	The heat capacity is commonly quoted as cp = 0.20 Btu/(lbm*F) or 840 joules/(kg*K).[http://www.greenhomebuilding.com/QandA/adobe/mass.htm] The density is 95 lbm/ft3 or 1520 kg/m3.
682	The thermal diffusivity is calculated to 0.0105 ft2/hr or 2.72x10-7 m2/s.
682	Adobe wall construction When building an adobe structure, the ground should be compressed because the weight of adobe bricks is significantly greater than a frame house, and foundation settling may cause cracking in the wall.
682	The footing is dug and compressed once again.
682	Footing depth depends on the region and its ground frost level.
682	The footing and stem wall are commonly 24 and 14 inches, much larger than a frame house because  of the weight of the walls.
682	Adobe bricks are laid by course.
682	Each course is laid the whole length of the wall, overlapping at the corners on a layer of adobe mortar.
682	Adobe walls usually never rise above two stories because they are load bearing and have low structural strength.
682	When placing window and door openings, a lintel is placed on top of the opening to support the bricks above.
682	Atop the last courses of brick, bond beams made of reinforced concrete or heavy wood beams are laid to provide a horizontal bearing plate for the roof beams and to redistribute lateral earthquake loads to shear walls more able to carry the forces.
682	To protect the interior and exterior adobe wall, finishes can be applied, such as mud plaster, whitewash or stucco.
682	These finishes protect the adobe wall from water damage, but need to be reapplied periodically, or the walls can be finished with other nontraditional plasters providing longer protection.
682	Bricks made with stabilized adobe generally do not need protection of plasters.
682	Adobe roof The traditional adobe roof has been constructed using a mixture of soil/clay, water, sand, and other available organic materials.
682	The mixture was then formed and pressed into wood forms, producing rows of dried earth bricks that would then be laid across a support structure of wood and plastered into place with more adobe.
682	For a deeper understanding of adobe, one might examine a cob building.
682	Cob, a close cousin to adobe, contains proportioned amounts of soil, clay, water, manure, and straw.
682	This is blended, but not formed like adobe.
682	Cob is spread and piled over the home's frame and allowed to air dry for several months before habitation.
682	Adobe, then, can be described as dried bricks of cob, stacked and mortared together with more adobe mixture to create a thick wall and/or roof.
682	Roof materials Depending on the materials available, a roof may be assembled using wood or metal beams to create a framework to begin layering adobe bricks.
682	Depending on the thickness of the adobe bricks, the framework has been preformed using a steel framing and a layering of a metal fencing or wiring over the framework to allow an even load as masses of adobe are spread across the metal fencing like cob and allowed to air dry accordingly.
682	This method was demonstrated with an adobe blend heavily impregnated with cement to allow even drying and prevent cracking.
682	Traditional adobe roof The more traditional flat adobe roofs are functional only in dry climates that are not exposed to snow loads which would call for a steepled roof.
682	Cement may be introduced into the adobe mixture to stablilize and strengthen the composite of mud and organic matter.
682	The heaviest wooden beams are called Vigas which support smaller members called satias upon which brush is then laid atop which the adobe layer applied.
682	Raising a traditional adobe roof To raise a flattened adobe roof, beams of wood or metal should be assembled and span the extent of the building.
682	The ends of the beams should then be attached  to the tops of the walls.
682	Taking into account the material from which the beams and walls are made, choosing the attachments may prove difficult.
682	A combination of the bricks and adobe mortar that are laid across the beams creates an even load-bearing pressure that can last for many years depending on attrition.
682	Once the vigas, satias and brush are laid, adobe bricks are placed.
682	An adobe roof is often laid with bricks slightly larger in width to ensure a greater expanse is covered when placing the bricks onto the roof.
682	Following each individual brick should be a layer of adobe mortar, recommended to be at least an inch thick to make certain there is ample strength between the brick’s edges and also to provide a relative moisture barrier during rain.
682	Attributes Depending on the materials, adobe roofs can be inherently fire-proof.
682	The construction of a chimney can greatly influence the construction of the roof supports, -proof.
682	Thecreating an extra need for care in choosing the materials.
682	The builders can make an adobe chimney by stacking simple adobe bricks in a similar fashion as the surrounding walls.
682	Adobe around the world The largest structure ever made from adobe (bricks) was the Bam Citadel, which suffered serious damage (up to 80%) by an earthquake on December 26, 2003.
682	Other large adobe structures are the Huaca del Sol in Peru, with 100 million signed bricks, the ciudellas of Chan Chan and Tambo Colorado, both in Peru (in South America).

683	An adventure is an exciting or unusual experience; it may also be a bold, usually risky undertaking, with an uncertain outcome.
683	Adventures may be activities with some potential for physical danger, such as skydiving, mountain climbing or participating in extreme sports.
683	The term also broadly refers to any enterprise that is potentially fraught with physical, financial or psychological risk, such as a business venture, a love affair, or other major life undertakings.
683	Adventurous experiences create psychological and physiological arousal, which can be interpreted as negative (e.g.
683	Yerkes-Dodson law.
683	For some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself.
683	According to adventurer André Malraux, in his La Condition Humaine (1933), "If a man is not ready to risk his life, where is his dignity?".
683	Similarly, Helen Keller stated that "Life is either a daring adventure or nothing."
683	Outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of recreation or excitement: examples are  adventure racing and adventure tourism.
683	Adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers.
683	Adventure education intentionally uses challenging experiences for learning.
683	Adventure in mythology Some of the oldest and most widespread stories in the world are stories of adventure such as Homer's The Odyssey.
683	Mythologist Joseph Campbell discussed his notion of the monomyth in his book, The Hero with a Thousand Faces.
683	Campbell proposed that the heroic mythological stories from culture to culture followed a similar underlying pattern, starting with the "call to adventure", followed by a hazardous journey, and eventual triumph.
683	The knight errant was the form the "adventure seeker" character took in the late Middle Ages.
683	The adventure novel exhibits these "protagonist on adventurous journey" characteristics a adventure novels do many popular feature films, such as Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark.
689	Asia ( or) is the world's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres.
689	It covers 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area and comprises 30% of its land area.
689	With approximately 4.3 billion people, it hosts 60% of the world's current human population.
689	Asia has a high growth rate in the modern era.
689	For instance, during the 20th century, Asia's population nearly quadrupled.
689	Asia is defined as comprising the eastwards four-fifths of Eurasia.
689	It is located to the east of the Suez Canal, the Ural river, and the Ural Mountains, and south of the Caucasus Mountains (or the Kuma-Manych Depression) and the Caspian and Black Seas.
689	It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean.
689	Given its size and diversity, Asia – a toponym dating back to classical antiquity – "is more a cultural concept" incorporating diverse regions and peoples than a homogeneous physical entity.
689	Asia differs very widely among and within its regions with regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems.
689	Definitionic groups, cultures, envir and boundaries  Greek three-continent system The original distinction between Europe and Asia was made by the ancient Greeks.
689	They used the Aegean Sea, the Dardanelles, the Sea of Marmara, the Bosporus, the Black Sea, the Kerch Strait, and the Sea of Azov as the border between Asia and Europe.
689	The Nile was often used as the border between Asia and Africa (then called Libya), although some Greek geographers suggested the Red Sea would form a better boundary.
689	Darius' canal between the Nile and the Red Sea introduced considerable variation in opinion.
689	Under the Roman Empire, the Don River emptying into the Black Sea was the western border of Asia.
689	It was the northernmost navigable point of the European shore.
689	In the 15th century the Red Sea became established as the boundary between Africa and Asia, replacing the Nile.
689	As exploration developed, the border between Asia and Europe had to be redefined, as the borders of the time did not extend to the arctic.
689	Asia-Europe boundary The Don River became unsatisfactory to northern Europeans when Peter the Great, king of the Tsardom of Russia, defeating rival claims of Sweden and the Ottoman Empire to the eastern lands, and armed resistance by the tribes of Siberia, synthesized a new Russian Empire extending to the Ural Mountains and beyond, founded in 1721.
689	The major geographical theorist of the empire was actually a former Swedish prisoner-of-war, taken at the Battle of Poltava in 1709 and assigned to Tobolsk, where he associated with Peter's Siberian official, Vasily Tatishchev, and was allowed freedom to conduct geographical and anthropological studies in preparation for a future book.
689	In Sweden, five years after Peter's death, in 1730 Philip Johan von Strahlenberg published a new atlas proposing the Urals as the border of Asia.
689	The Russians were enthusiastic about the concept, which allowed them to keep their European identity in geography as well as other cultural heritage.
689	Tatishchev announced that he had proposed the idea to von Strahlenberg.
689	The latter had suggested the Emba River as the lower boundary.
689	Over the next century various proposals were made until the Ural River prevailed in the mid-19th century.
689	The border had been moved perforce from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea into which the Ural River projects.
689	In the maps of the period, Transcaucasia was counted as Asian.
689	The incorporation of most of that region into the Soviet Union tended to push views of the border to the south.
689	It also has many mountainous terrains Asia-Oceania boundary The border between Asia and Oceania is placed somewhere in the Malay archipelago.
689	The terms Southeast Asia and Oceania, devised in the 19th century, have had  vastly different geographic meanings since their inception.
689	Oceania has never been Asia, whatever it may have been defined to be.
689	The chief factor in determining what islands of the Malay Archipelago are Asian has been the location of the colonial possessions of the various empires there (not all European).
689	Lewis and Wigen assert, "The narrowing of 'Southeast Asia' to its present boundaries was thus a gradual process."
689	Ongoing definition Geographical Asia is a cultural artifact, an imprecise concept causing endemic contention about what it means.
689	In contrast to Europe, Asia is the largest and most culturally diverse of the continents in the seven-continent system.
689	It does not exactly correspond to the cultural borders of its various types of constituents.
689	In addition to its general inherited geographical meaning, to which the entire literate world subscribes, Asia has any number of agency-specific meanings organizationally and operationally of use in more restricted fields of interest.
689	For example, the World University Service of Canada uses the administrative divisions of the Middle East and Europe, and South and Southeast Asia—their definition of "Asia" is substantially different from the wider definition, and the same may apply to other agencies worldwide.
689	Some differing uses of "Asia" have been promulgated by the news media reporting on current events.
689	For example, BBC News has an Asia-Pacific section, which acquires news from anywhere in Australasia, Oceania or the Pacific side of the Americas.
689	From the time of Herodotus a minority of geographers have rejected the three-continent system (Europe, Africa, Asia) on the grounds that there is no or is no substantial physical separation between them.
689	For example, Sir Barry Cunliffe, the emeritus professor of European archeology at Oxford, argues that Europe has been geographically and culturally merely "the western excrescence of the continent of Asia".
689	Geographically, Asia is the major eastern constituent of the continent of Eurasia with Europe being a northwestern peninsula of the landmass – or of Afro-Eurasia; geologically, Asia, Europe and Africa make up a single continuous landmass (except for the Suez Canal) and share a common continental shelf.
689	Almost all of Europe and most of Asia sit atop the Eurasian Plate, adjoined on the south by the Arabian and Indian Plate and with the easternmost part of Siberia (east of the Cherskiy Range) on the North American Plate.
689	Etymology  Asia was originally a concept of Western civilization.
689	The place name, "Asia", in various forms in a large number of modern languages is of unknown ultimate provenience.
689	Its etymology and language of origin are uncertain.
689	It appears to be one of the most ancient of recorded names.
689	A number of theories have been published.
689	English Asia can be traced through the formation of English literature to Latin literature, where it has the same form, Asia.
689	Whether all uses and all forms of the name derive also from the Latin of the Roman Empire is much less certain.
689	Classical antiquity Latin Asia and Greek Ἀσία appear to be the same word.
689	Roman authors translated Ἀσία as Asia.
689	The Romans named a province Asia, which was in the location of the then Asia.
689	There was an Asia Minor and an Asia Major (Iraq), of which the name of Minor survived.
689	As the earliest evidence of the name is Greek, it is likely circumstantially that Asia came from Ἀσία, but ancient transitions, due to the lack of literary ely circumstantially that Asia camecontexts, are difficult to catch in the act.
689	The most likely vehicles were the ancient geographers and historians, such as Herodotus, who were all Greek.
689	Roman civilization Hellenized extensively.
689	Ancient Greek certainly evidences early and rich uses of the name.
689	The first continental use of Asia is attributed to Herodotus (about 440 BC), not because he innovated it, but because his Histories are the earliest surviving prose to describe it in any detail.
689	He defines it carefully, mentioning the previous geographers whom he had read, but whose works are now missing.
689	By it he means Anatolia and the Persian Empire, in contrast to Greece and Egypt.
689	Herodotus comments that he is puzzled as to why three women's names were "given to a tract which is in reality one" (Europa, Asia, and Libya, referring to Africa), stating that most Greeks assumed that Asia was named after the wife of Prometheus (i.e.
689	Hesione), but that the Lydians say it was named after Asies, son of Cotys, who passed the name on to a tribe at Sardis.
689	In Greek mythology, "Asia" (Ἀσία) or "Asie" (Ἀσίη) was the name of a "Nymph or Titan goddess of Lydia."
689	Herodotus' geographical puzzlement was perhaps only a form of disagreement, as, having read the earlier Greek poetry along with everyone else literate, he would have known perfectly well why places received female names.
689	Athens, Mycenae, Thebes and many other locations in fact had them.
689	In ancient Greek religion, places were under the care of female divinities, parallel to guardian angels.
689	The poets detailed their doings and generations in allegoric language salted with entertaining stories, which subsequently playwrights transformed into classical Greek drama and became "Greek mythology."
689	For example, Hesiod mentions the daughters of Tethys and Ocean, among whom are a "holy company", "who with the Lord Apollo and the Rivers have youths in their keeping."
689	Many of these are geographic: Doris, Rhodea, Europa, Asia.
689	Hesiod explains:"For there are three-thousand neat-ankled daughters of Ocean who are dispersed far and wide, and in every place alike serve the earth and the deep waters."
689	The Iliad (attributed by the ancient Greeks to Homer) mentions two Phrygians (the tribe that replaced the Luvians in Lydia) in the Trojan War named Asios (an adjective meaning "Asian"); and also a marsh or lowland containing a marsh in Lydia as ασιος.
689	Bronze Age Before Greek poetry, the Aegean Sea area was in a Greek Dark Age, at the beginning of which syllabic writing was lost and alphabetic writing had not begun.
689	Prior to then in the Bronze Age the records of the Assyrian Empire, the Hittite Empire and the various Mycenaean states of Greece mention a region undoubtedly Asia, certainly in Anatolia, including if not identical to Lydia.
689	These records are administrative and do not include poetry.
689	The Mycenaean states were destroyed about 1200 BC by unknown agents although one school of thought assigns the Dorian invasion to this time.
689	The burning of the palaces baked clay diurnal administrative records written in a Greek syllabic script called Linear B, deciphered by a number of interested parties, most notably by a young World War II cryptographer, Michael Ventris, subsequently assisted by the scholar, John Chadwick.
689	A major cache discovered by Carl Blegen at the site of ancient Pylos included hundreds of male and female names formed by different methods.
689	Some of these are of women held in servitude (as study of the society implied by the content reveals).
689	They were used in trades, such as cloth-making, and usually came with children.
689	The epithet, lawiaiai, "captives," associated with some of them identifies their origin.
689	Some are ethnic names.
689	One in particular, aswiai, identifies "women of Asia."
689	Perhaps they were captured in Asia, but some others, Milatiai, appear to have been of Miletus, a Greek colony, which would not have been raided for slaves by Greeks.
689	Chadwick suggests that the names record the locations where these foreign women were purchased.
689	The name is also in the singular, Aswia, which refers both to the name of a country and to a female of it.
689	There is a masculine form, aswios.
689	This Aswia appears to have been a remnant of a region known to the Hittites as Assuwa, centered on Lydia, or "Roman Asia."
689	This name, Assuwa, has been suggested as the origin for the name of the continent "Asia".
689	The Assuwa league was a confederation of states in western Anatolia, defeated by the Hittites under Tudhaliya I around 1400 BC.
689	Alternatively, the etymology of the term may be from the Akkadian word ', which means 'to go outside' or 'to ascend', referring to the direction of the sun at sunrise in the Middle East and also likely connected with the Phoenician word asa meaning east.
689	This may be contrasted to a similar etymology proposed for Europe, as being from Akkadian erēbu(m) 'to enter' or 'set' (of the sun).
689	T.R.
689	Reid supports this alternative etymology, noting that the ancient Greek name must have derived from asu, meaning 'east' in Assyrian (ereb for Europe meaning 'west').
689	The ideas of Occidental (form Latin Occidens 'setting') and Oriental (from Latin Oriens for 'rising') are also European invention, synonymous with Western and Eastern.
689	Reid further emphasizes that it explains the Western point of view of placing all the peoples and cultures of Asia into a single classification, almost as if there were a need for setting the distinction between Western and Eastern civilizations on the Eurasian continent.
689	Ogura Kazuo and Tenshin Okakura are two outspoken Japanese figures on the subject.
689	History The history of Asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions: East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East, linked by the interior mass of the Central Asian steppes.
689	The coastal periphery was home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations, each of them developing around fertile river valleys.
689	The civilizations in Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley and the Huanghe shared many similarities.
689	These civilizations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel.
689	Other innovations, such as writianged technologies and ideas such as ng, seem to have been developed individually in each area.
689	Cities, states and empires developed in these lowlands.
689	The central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse-mounted nomads who could reach all areas of Asia from the steppes.
689	The earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the Indo-Europeans, who spread their languages into the Middle East, South Asia, and the borders of China, where the Tocharians resided.
689	The northernmost part of Asia, including much of Siberia, was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads, owing to the dense forests, climate and tundra.
689	These areas remained very sparsely populated.
689	The center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts.
689	The Caucasus and Himalaya mountains and the Karakum and Gobi deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty.
689	While the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially, in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe.
689	However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force; for this and other reasons, the nomads who conquered states in China, India, and the Middle East often found themselves adapting to the local, more affluent societies.
689	The Islamic Caliphate took over the Middle East and Central Asia during the Muslim conquests of the 7th century.
689	The Mongol Empire conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century, an area extending from China to Europe.
689	Geography and climate Asia is the largest continent on Earth.
689	It covers 8.8% of the Earth's total surface area (or 30% of its land area), and has the largest coastline, at 62800 km.
689	Asia is generally defined as comprising the eastern four-fifths of Eurasia.
689	It is located to the east of the Suez Canal and the Ural Mountains, and south of the Caucasus Mountains (or the Kuma-Manych Depression) and the Caspian and Black Seas.
689	It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean.
689	Asia is subdivided into 48 countries, two of them (Russia and Turkey) having part of their land in Europe.
689	Asia has extremely diverse climates and geographic features.
689	Climates range from arctic and subarctic in Siberia to tropical in southern India and Southeast Asia.
689	It is moist across southeast sections, and dry across much of the interior.
689	Some of the largest daily temperature ranges on Earth occur in western sections of Asia.
689	The monsoon circulation dominates across southern and eastern sections, due to the presence of the Himalayas forcing the formation of a thermal low which draws in moisture during the summer.
689	Southwestern sections of the continent are hot.
689	Siberia is one of the coldest places in the Northern Hemisphere, and can act as a source of arctic air masses for North America.
689	The most active place on Earth for tropical cyclone activity lies northeast of the Philippines and south of Japan.
689	The Gobi Desert is in Mongolia and the Arabian Desert stretches across much of the Middle East.
689	The Yangtze River in China is the longest river in the continent.
689	The Himalayas between India and China is the tallest mountain range in the world.
689	Tropical rainforests stretch across much of southern Asia and coniferous and deciduous forests lie farther north.
689	Economy  Asia has the second largest nominal GDP of all continents, after Europe, but the largest when measured in purchasing power parity.
689	As of 2011, the largest economies in Asia are China, Japan, India, South Korea and Indonesia.
689	Based on Global Office Locations 2011, Asia dominated the office locations with 4 of top 5 were in Asia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo, Seoul and Shanghai.
689	Around 68 percent of international firms have office in Hong Kong.
689	In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the economies of the PRC and India have been growing rapidly, both with an average annual growth rate of more than 8%.
689	Other recent very high growth nations in Asia include Israel, Malaysia, Indonesia, Pakistan, Thailand, Vietnam, Mongolia, Uzbekistan, Cyprus and the Philippines, and mineral-rich nations such as Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Iran, Brunei, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman.
689	According to economic historian Angus Maddison in his book The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective, India had the world's largest economy during 0 BCE and 1000 BCE.
689	China was the largest and most advanced economy on earth for much of recorded history, until the British Empire (excluding India) overtook it in the mid-19th century.
689	For several decades in the late twentieth century Japan was the largest economy in Asia and second-largest of any single nation in the world, after surpassing the Soviet Union (measured in net material product) in 1986 and Germany in 1968.
689	NB: A number of supernational economies are larger, such as the European Union (EU), the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or APEC).
689	This ended in 2010 when China overtook Japan to become the world's second largest economy.
689	In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Japan's GDP was almost as large (current exchange rate method) as that of the rest of Asia combined.
689	In 1995, Japan's economy nearly equaled that of the USA as the largest economy in the world for a day, after the Japanese currency reached a record high of 79 yen/US$.
689	Economic growth in Asia since World War II to the 1990s had been concentrated in Japan as well as the four regions of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore located in the Pacific Rim, known as the Asian tigers, which have now all received developed country status, having the highest GDP per capita in Asia.
689	It is forecasted that India will overtake Japan in terms of nominal GDP by 2020.
689	By 2027, according to Goldman Sachs, China will have the largest economy in the world.
689	Several trade blocs exist, with the most developed being the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
689	Asia is the largest continent in the world by a considerable margin, and it is rich in natural resources, such as petroleum, forests, fish, water, rice, copper and silver.
689	Manufacturing in Asia has traditionally been strongest in East and Southeast Asia, particularly in the China, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, India, the Philippines, and Singapore.
689	Japan and South Korea continue to dominate in the area of multinational corporations, but increasingly the PRC and India are making significant inroads.
689	Many companies from Europe, North America, South Korea and Japan have operations in Asia's developing countries to take advantage of its abundant supply of cheap labour and relatively developed infrastructure.
689	According to Citigroup 9 of 11 Global Growth Generators countries came from Asia driven by population and income growth.
689	They are Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Mongolia, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.
689	Asia has four main financial centres: Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore and Shanghai.
689	Call centres and business process outsourcing (BPOs) are becoming major employers in India and the Philippines due to the availability of a large pool of highly skilled, English-speaking workers.
689	The increased use of outsourcing has assisted the rise of India and the China as financial centres.
689	Due to its large and extremely competitive information technology industry, India has become a major hub for outsourcing.
689	In 2010, Asia had 3.3 million millionaires (people with net worth over US$1 million excluding their homes), slightly below North America with 3.4 million millionaires.
689	Last year Asia had toppled Europe.
689	Citigroup in The Wealth Report 2012 stated that Asian centa-millionaire overtook North America's wealth for the first time as the world's "economic center of gravity" continued moving east.
689	At the end of 2011, there were 18,000 Asian people mainly in Southeast Asia, China and Japan who have at least $100 million in disposable assets, while North America with 17,000 people and Western Europe with 14,000 people.
689	Demographics East Asia had by far the strongest overall Human Development Index (HDI) improvement of any region in the world, nearly doubling average HDI attainment over the past 40 years, according to the report’s analysis of health, education and income data.
689	China, the second highest achiever in the world in terms of HDI improvement since 1970, is the only country on the “Top 10 Movers” list due to income rather than health or education achievements.
689	Its per capita income increased a stunning 21-fold over the last four decades, also lifting hundreds of millions out of income poverty.
689	Yet it was not among the region’s top performers in improving school enrolment and life expectancy.
689	Nepal, a South Asian country, emerges as one of the world’s fastest movers since 1970 mainly due to health and education achievements.
689	Its present life expectancy is 25 years longer than in the 1970s.
689	More than four of every five children of school age in Nepal now attend primary school, compared to just one in five 40 years ago.
689	Japan and South Korea ranked highest among the countries grouped on the HDI (number 11 and 12 in the world, which are in the “very high human development” category), followed by Hong Kong (SAR)(21) and Singapore (27).
689	Afghanistan (155) ranked lowest amongst Asian countries out of the 169 countries assessed.
689	Languages Asia is home to several language families and many language isolates.
689	Most Asian countries have more than one language that is natively spoken.
689	For instance, according to Ethnologue, more than 600 languages are spoken in Indonesia, more than 800 languages spoken in India, and more than 100 are spoken in the Philippines.
689	China has many languages and dialects in different provinces.
689	Religions  Almost all Asian religions have philosophical character and Asian philosophical traditions cover a large spectrum of philosophical thoughts and writings.
689	Indian philosophy includes Hindu philosophy and Buddhist philosophy.
689	They include elements of nonmaterial pursuits, whereas another school of thought from India, Cārvāka, preached the enjoyment of material world.
689	As of 2012, Hinduism has around 1.1 billion adherents.
689	The faith represents around 25% of Asia's population and is the second largest religion in Asia.
689	However, it is mostly concentrated in south Asia.
689	Islam is the largest religion in Asia.
689	Christianity is also present in most Asian countries.
689	Asian mythology is complex and diverse.
689	The story of the Great Flood for example, as presented to Christians in the Old Testament, is first found in Mesopotamian mythology, in the Epic of Gilgamesh.
689	Hindu mythology tells about an Avatar of the God Vishnu in the form of a fish who warned Manu of a terrible flood.
689	In ancient Chinese mythology, Shan Hai Jing, the Chinese ruler Da Yu, had to spend 10 years to control a deluge which swept out most of ancient China and was aided by the goddess Nüwa who literally fixed the broken sky through which huge rains were pouring.
689	Abrahamic  The Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity, Islam and Baha'i Faith originated in West Asia.
689	Judaism, the oldest of the Abrahamic faiths, is practiced primarily in Israel (the birthplace and historical homeland of the Jewish people, whose Jewish population today consists equally of those Israelites who remained in Asia/North Africa and those who returned from exile in the European diaspora), though small communities exist in other countries, such as the Bene Israel in India.
689	In the Philippines and East Timor, Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion; it was introduced by the Spaniards and the Portuguese, respectively.
689	In Armenia, Cyprus, Georgia and Russia, Eastern Orthodoxy is the predominant religion.
689	Various Christian denominations have adherents in portions of the Middle East, as well as China and India.
689	The world's largest Muslim community (within the bounds of one nation) is in Indonesia.
689	South Asia (mainly Pakistan, India and Bangladesh) holds 30% of Muslims.
689	There are also significant Muslim populations in China, Iran, Malaysia, southern Philippines (Mindanao), Russia and most of West Asia and Central Asia.
689	The Bahá'í Faith originated in Asia, in Iran (Persia), and spread from there to the Ottoman Empire, Central Asia, India, and Burma during the lifetime of Bahá'u'lláh.
689	Since the middle of the 20th century, growth has particularly occurred in other Asian countries, because the Bahá'í Faith's activities in many Muslim countries has been severely suppressed by authorities.
689	Dharmic and Taoist  The religions of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism originated in India, South Asia.
689	In East Asia, particularly in China and Japan, Confucianism, Taoism and Zen Buddhism took shape.
689	Over 80% of the populations of both India and Nepal adhere to Hinduism, alongside significant communities in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Bali.
689	Many overseas Indians in countries such as Burma, Singapore and Malaysia also adhere to Hinduism.
689	Buddhism has a great following in mainland Southeast Asia and East Asia.
689	Buddhism is the religion of the majority of the populations of Cambodia (98%), Thailand (95%), Burma (89%), Japan (84–96%), Bhutan (75%), Sri Lanka (69%), Laos (67%–98%) and Mongolia (50%).
689	Large Buddhist populations also exist in Singapore (42.5%), Taiwan (35.1%–93%), South Korea (23.2%), Malaysia (19.2%), Nepal (10.7%), Vietnam (9.3–80%), China (8–80%), North Korea (4.5%–60%), Indonesia (<2%); and small communities in India and Bangladesh.
689	In many Chinese communities, Mahayana Buddhism is easily syncretized with Taoism, thus exact religious statistics is difficult to obtain and may be understated or overstated.
689	The Communist-governed countries of China, Vietnam and North Korea are officially atheist, thus the number of Buddhists and other religious adherents may be under-reported.
689	Jainism is found mainly in India and in oversea Indian communities such as India and Malaysia.
689	Sikhism is found in Northern India and amongst overseas Indian communities in other parts of Asia, especially Southeast Asia.
689	Confucianism is found predominantly in Mainland China, South Korea, Taiwan and in overseas Chinese populations.
689	Taoism is found mainly in Mainland China, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore.
689	Taoism is easily syncretized with Mahayana Buddhism for many Chinese, thus exact religious statistics is difficult to obtain and may be understated or overstated.

689	Political geography
690	Aruba ( ,) is a 33-kilometer-long (20 mi) island of the Lesser Antilles in the southern Caribbean Sea, located  north of the coast of Venezuela.
690	Together with Bonaire and Curaçao, it forms a group referred to as the ABC islands of the Leeward Antilles, the southern island chain of the Lesser Antilles.
690	Collectively, Aruba and the other Dutch islands in the Antilles are commonly referred to as the Netherlands Antilles or the Dutch Antilles.
690	Along with the Netherlands, Curaçao and Sint Maarten, Aruba is one of the four constituent countries that form the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
690	The citizens of all share a single nationality: Dutch.
690	Aruba has no administrative e Netherlands.
690	The citsubdivisions, but, for census purposes, is divided into eight regions.
690	Its capital is Oranjestad.
690	Unlike much of the Caribbean region, Aruba has a dry climate and an arid, cactus-strewn landscape.
690	This climate has helped tourism as visitors to the island can reliably expect warm, sunny weather.
690	It has a land area of 179 km2 and is densely populated with a total of 101,484 inhabitants at the 2010 Census.
690	It lies outside the hurricane belt.
690	History  Aruba's first inhabitants are thought to have been Caquetíos Amerinds from the Arawak tribe, who migrated there from Venezuela to escape attacks by the Caribs.
690	Fragments of the earliest known Indian settlements date back to 1000 AD.
690	Sea currents made canoe travel to other Caribbean islands difficult, thus Caquetio culture remained closer to that of mainland South America.
690	Europeans first learned of Aruba following the explorations of Amerigo Vespucci and Alonso de Ojeda in the summer of 1499.
690	Though Vespucci boasted of discovering the island, he and Ojeda were likely guided there by natives of nearby islands.
690	Both described Aruba as an "island of giants", remarking on the comparatively large stature of the native Caquetíos compared to Europeans.
690	Ojeda also referred to the island as "Oro Hubo", Spanish for "It Had Gold".
690	Gold was not discovered on Aruba, however, for another 300 years.
690	Vespucci returned to Spain with stocks of cotton and brazilwood from the island and described houses built into the ocean.
690	Vespucci and Ojeda's tales spurred interest in Aruba and Spaniards soon colonized the island.
690	Aruba was colonized by Spain for over a century.
690	The Cacique or Indian Chief in Aruba, Simas, welcomed the first priests in Aruba and received from them a wooden cross as a gift.
690	In 1508, Alonso de Ojeda was appointed as Spain's first Governor of Aruba, as part of "Nueva Andalucía".
690	Another governor appointed by Spain was Juan Martínez de Ampiés.
690	A "cédula real" decreed in November 1525 gave Ampíes, factor of Española, the right to repopulate Aruba.
690	In 1528, Ampíes was replaced by a representative of the House of Welser.
690	Aruba has been under Dutch administration since 1636, initially under Peter Stuyvesant.
690	Stuyvesant was on a special mission in Aruba in November and December 1642.
690	Under the Dutch W.I.C.
690	"New Netherland and Curaçao" from 1648 to 1664 and the Dutch government regulations of 1629, also applied in Aruba.
690	The Dutch administration appointed an Irishman as "Commandeur" in Aruba in 1667.
690	In August 1806, General Francisco de Miranda and a group of 200 freedom fighters on their voyage to liberate Venezuela from Spain stayed in Aruba for several weeks.
690	In 1933 Aruba sent its first petition for Aruba's separate status and autonomy to the Queen.
690	During World War II, Aruba was one of the main suppliers of refined petroleum products to the Allies.
690	Aruba became a British protectorate from 1940 to 1942 and a US protectorate from 1942 to 1945.
690	On 16 February 1942, its oil processing refinery was attacked by a German submarine (U-156) under the command of Werner Hartenstein, but the mission failed.
690	In March 1944, Eleanor Roosevelt briefly visited American troops stationed in Aruba.
690	In attendance were Curaçao Governor P.
690	Kasteel, and U.S.
690	Rear Admiral T.
690	E.
690	Chandler.
690	Move towards independence  In August 1947, Aruba presented its first "Staatsreglement" (constitution), for Aruba's "status aparte" as the status of an autonomous state within the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
690	By 1954, the Charter of the Kingdom of the Netherlands was established, providing a framework for relations between Aruba and the rest of the Kingdom.
690	In 1972, at a conference in Suriname, Betico Croes (MEP) proposed a "sui-generis" Dutch Commonwealth of four states: Aruba, the Netherlands, Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles, each with its own nationality.
690	Mr.
690	C.
690	Yarzagaray, a parliamentary member representing the AVP political party, proposed a referendum for the people of Aruba to determine Aruba's separate status or "Status Aparte" as a full autonomous state under the crown.
690	He proclaimed: "Aruba shall never accept a federation and a second class nationality."
690	Betico Croes worked in Aruba to inform and prepare the people of Aruba for independence.
690	In 1976, a committee appointed by Croes introduced the national flag and anthem as the symbols of Aruba's sovereignty and independence, and he also set 1981 as a target for Aruba's independence.
690	In March 1977, the first Referendum for Self Determination was held with the support of the United Nations and 82% of the participants voted for independence.
690	The Island Government of Aruba assigned the Institute of Social Studies in The Hague to prepare a study of Aruba's independence, which was published in 1978, titled "Aruba en Onafhankelijkheid, achtergronden, modaliteiten en mogelijkheden; een rapport in eerste aanleg" ["Aruba and independence, backgrounds, modalities and opportunities; a preliminary report"].
690	At the conference in The Hague in 1981, Aruba's independence was set for the year 1991.
690	In March 1983 Aruba reached an official agreement within the Kingdom for Aruba's Independence, which would occur in a series of steps granting increasing autonomy.
690	In August 1985 Aruba drafted a constitution that was unanimously approved.
690	On 1 January 1986, after elections were held for Aruba's first parliament, Aruba seceded from the Netherlands Antilles and officially became a country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
690	Full independence was projected in 1996.
690	Croes was later proclaimed "Libertador di Aruba" after his death in 1986.
690	At a convention in The Hague in 1990, the governments of Aruba, the Netherlands and the Netherlands Antilles postponed indefinitely Aruba's transition to full independence at the request of its Prime Minister.
690	The article scheduling Aruba's complete independence was rescinded in 1995, although the process can begin again after a referendum.
690	Geography  Aruba is a generally flat, riverless island in the Leeward Antilles island arc of the Lesser Antilles.
690	Aruba is widely known for its white sandy beaches on the western and southern coasts of the island, relatively sheltered from fierce ocean currents, and this is where most tourist development island, relatively shhas taken place.
690	The northern and eastern coasts, lacking this protection, are considerably more battered by the sea and have been left largely untouched by humans.
690	The hinterland of the island features some rolling hills, the best known of which are called Hooiberg at 165 m and Mount Jamanota, the highest on the island at 188 m above sea level.
690	Oranjestad, the capital, is located at .
690	To the east of Aruba are Bonaire and Curaçao, two island territories which once formed the southwest part of the Netherlands Antilles; this group of islands is sometimes called the ABC islands.
690	The Natural Bridge was a large, naturally formed limestone bridge on the island's north shore that was a popular tourist destination until its collapse in 2005.
690	File:ArubaNaturalBabyBridge.JPG|Baby natural bridge in Aruba File:197306 aruba naturalbridge.jpg|Natural bridge in Aruba (collapsed 2 September 2005) Cities and towns  The island, with a population of just over 100,000 inhabitants, does not have major cities.
690	Oranjestad (33,000 in 2006) * Paradera * San Nicolas * Noord * Santa Cruz * Savaneta Fauna The island provides a habitat for the endemic Aruba Island Rattlesnake.
690	Climate  In the Köppen climate classification, Aruba has a semi-arid climate.
690	Temperature varies little from 28 °C to around 33 C, moderated by constant trade winds from the Atlantic Ocean, which comes from north-east.
690	Yearly precipitation barely exceeds 400 mm.
690	Demographics  Aruba is situated in the deep southern part of the Caribbean.
690	Because it has low rainfall, Aruba was saved from the plantation system and the economics of the slave trade.
690	Aruba's population is estimated to be 80% mixed white/Caribbean Amerindian and 20% other ethnicities.
690	Arawaks spoke the "broken Spanish" which their ancestors had learned on Hispaniola.
690	The Dutch took control 135 years after the Spanish, leaving the Arawaks to farm and graze livestock, and used the island as a source of meat for other Dutch possessions in the Caribbean, leading to a depletion of the Arawak population.
690	The Arawak heritage is stronger on Aruba than on most Caribbean islands.
690	Although no full-blooded Aboriginals remain, the features of the islanders clearly indicate their genetic Arawak heritage.
690	Most of the population is descended mostly from Arawak, and to a lesser extent Spanish, Italian, Dutch, and a few French, Portuguese, British, and African ancestors.
690	Recently there has been substantial immigration to the island from neighboring American and Caribbean nations, possibly attracted by the higher paid jobs.
690	In 2007, new immigration laws were introduced to help control the growth of the population by restricting foreign workers to a maximum of three years residency on the island.
690	Demographically, Aruba has felt the impact of its proximity to Venezuela.
690	Many of Aruba's families are descended from Venezuelan immigrants.
690	There is a seasonal increase of Venezuelans living in second homes.
690	Language  Language can be seen as an important part of island culture in Aruba.
690	The official languages are Dutch and – since 2003 – Papiamento.
690	Papiamento is the predominant language on Aruba.
690	A creole language spoken on Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao, it incorporates words from other languages including Portuguese, West African languages, Dutch, and Spanish.
690	English is known by many; its usage has grown due to tourism.
690	Other common languages spoken based on the size of their community are Portuguese, Chinese, German, Spanish, and French.
690	In recent years, the government of Aruba has shown an increased interest in acknowledging the cultural and historical importance of its native language.
690	Although spoken Papiamento is fairly similar among the several Papiamento-speaking islands, there is a big difference in written Papiamento.
690	The orthography differs per island and even per group of people.
690	Some are more oriented towards Portuguese and use the equivalent spelling (e.g.
690	"y" instead of "j"), where others are more oriented towards Dutch.
690	The book The Buccaneers of America, first published in 1678, states through eyewitness account that the IndThe Buccaneers of Amerians on Aruba spoke "Spanish".
690	The oldest government official statement written in Papiamento dates from 1803.
690	Around 12.6% of the population today speaks Spanish.
690	Aruba has four newspapers published in Papiamento: Diario, Bon Dia, Solo di Pueblo and Awe Mainta; and two in English: Aruba Today and The News.
690	Amigoe is the newspaper published in Dutch.
690	Aruba also has 18 radio stations (two AM and 16 FM) and three local television stations (Tele-Aruba, Aruba Broadcast Company and Channel 22).
690	Regions  For census purposes, Aruba is divided into eight regions, which have no administrative functions: Government  As a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Aruba's politics take place within a framework of a 21-member Parliament and an eight-member Cabinet.
690	The governor of Aruba is appointed for a six-year term by the monarch, and the prime minister and deputy prime minister are elected by the Staten (or "Parlamento") for four-year terms.
690	The Staten is made up of 21 members elected by direct, popular vote to serve a four-year term.
690	Together with the Netherlands, the countries of Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten form the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
690	As they share the same Dutch citizenship, these four countries still also share the Dutch passport as the Kingdom of the Netherlands passport.
690	As Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten have small populations, the three countries had to limit immigration.
690	To protect their population, they have the right to control the admission and expulsion of people from the Netherlands.
690	Aruba is designated as a member of the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT) and is thus officially not a part of the European Union, though Aruba can and does receive support from the European Development Fund.
690	Politics  The Aruban legal system is based on the Dutch model.
690	Instead of juries or grand juries, in Aruba, legal jurisdiction lies with the Gerecht in Eerste Aanleg (Court of First Instance) on Aruba, the Gemeenschappelijk Hof van Justitie van Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten en van Bonaire, Sint Eustatius en Saba (Joint Court of Justice of Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten, and of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba) and the Hoge Raad der Nederlanden (Supreme Court of Justice of the Netherlands).
690	The Korps Politie Aruba (Aruba Police Force) is the island's law enforcement agency and operates district precincts in Oranjestad, Noord, San Nicolaas, and Santa Cruz, where it is headquartered.
690	Deficit spending has been a staple in Aruba's history, and modestly high inflation has been present as well.
690	As of 2006, the government's debt had grown to 1.883 billion Aruban florins.
690	Aruba received some development aid from the Dutch government each year through 2009, as part of a deal (signed as "Aruba's Financial Independence") in which the Netherlands gradually reduced its financial help to the island each successive year.
690	In 2006 the Aruban government changed several tax laws to reduce the deficit.
690	Direct taxes have been converted to indirect taxes as proposed by the IMF.
690	A 3% tax has been introduced on sales and services, while income taxes have been lowered and revenue taxes for business reduced by 20%.
690	The government compensated workers with 3.1% for the effect that the B.B.O.
690	Education  Aruba's educational system is patterned after the Dutch system of education.
690	There are 68 schools for primary education, 12 schools for secondary education, and 5 universities in Aruba.
690	In 2007, there were 22,930 registered full-time students.
690	The Government of Aruba finances the national education system, except for private schools, such as the International School of Aruba (ISA), which finance their own activities.
690	The percentage of money earmarked for education is higher than the average for the Caribbean/Latin American region.There is also a private Dutch school on the island: Schakel College.
690	Arubans have a primary school system, followed by a segmented secondary school program which includes vocational training, basic education, college preparation and advanced placement.
690	The study of Spanish and French is offered in secondary school and college, since a high percentage of students continue their studies in Europe.
690	Higher education is available through the Professional Education program (EPI), the teachers college (IPA) as well as through the University of Aruba (UA) which offers bachelors and masters programs in law, finance and economics and hospitality and tourism management.
690	Since the choice for programs in la higher education on the island itself is limited, many students choose study in the Netherlands, or abroad in countries in North America, South America as well as the rest of Europe.
690	Aruba is also home to two medical schools: Aureus University School of Medicine and Xavier University School of Medicine.
690	Economy  Aruba has one of the highest standards of living in the Caribbean region.
690	There is a low unemployment rate.
690	The GDP per capita for Aruba was estimated to be $21,800 in 2004; among the highest in the Caribbean and the Americas.
690	Its main trading partners are Venezuela, the United States and the Netherlands.
690	The island's economy has been dominated by five main industries: tourism, gold mining, phosphate mining (The Aruba Phosphaat Maatschappij), aloe export, and petroleum refining (The Lago Oil & Transport Company and the Arend Petroleum Maatschappij Shell Co.).
690	Before the "Status Aparte" (a separate completely autonomous country/state within the Kingdom), oil processing was the dominant industry in Aruba despite expansion of the tourism sector.
690	Today, the influence of the oil processing business is minimal.
690	The size of the agriculture and manufacturing sectors also remains minimal.
690	The inflation on Aruba in 2007 was 8.7%.
690	The exchange rate of the Aruban florin has remained steady in recent years at 1.78 florins to 1 US dollar.
690	Because of this fact, and due to a large number of American tourists, many businesses operate using US dollars instead of florins, especially in the hotel & resort districts.
690	Tourism About three quarters of the Aruban gross national product is earned through tourism or related activities.
690	Most tourists are from (mainland) the Netherlands,Venezuela and the United States (predominantly from eastern and southern states).
690	As part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, citizens of (mainland) the Netherlands can travel with relative ease to Aruba and other islands of the Dutch Antilles.
690	No visas are needed for Dutch citizens, only a passport, and although the currency used in Aruba is different (the Netherlands has the Euro), Euro's are still widely accepted and easily exchanged for Aruban Florins.
690	For the facilitation of the passengers whose destination is the United States, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S.
690	Customs and Border Protection (CBP) full pre-clearance facility in Aruba has been in effect since 1 February 2001 with the expansion in the Queen Beatrix Airport.
690	United States and Aruba have had the agreement since 1986.
690	It began as a USDA and Customs post.
690	Since 2008, Aruba has been the only island to have this service for private flights.
690	Foreign military In 1999, the U.S.
690	Department of Defense established a Forward Operating Location (FOL) at the airport.
690	Culture  On 18 March Aruba celebrates its National Day.
690	In 1976, Aruba presented its National Anthem (Aruba Dushi Tera) and Flag.
690	The origins of the population and location of the island give Aruba a mixed culture.
690	According to the Bureau Burgelijke Stand en Bevolkingsregister (BBSB), as of 2005 there are ninety-two different nationalities living on the island.
690	Dutch influence can still be seen, as in the celebration of "Sinterklaas" on 5 and 6 December and other national holidays like 30 April, when in Aruba and the rest of the Kingdom of the Netherlands the Queen's birthday or "Dia di La Reina" (Koninginnedag) is celebrated.
690	Christmas and New Years Eve are celebrated with the typical music and songs for gaitas for Christmas and the Dande for New Year, and the "ayaca", "ponche crema," ham, and other typical foods and drinks.
690	Millions of florins worth of fireworks are burnt at midnight on New Year's Eve.
690	On 25 January, Betico Croes' birthday is celebrated.
690	In June there is the celebration of the "Dia di San Juan", with the song of "Dera Gai".
690	Besides Christmas, the religious holy days of the Feast of the Ascension and Good Friday are holidays on the island.
690	The holiday of Carnival is also an important one in Aruba, as it is in many Caribbean and Latin American countries, and, like Mardi Gras, that goes on for weeks.
690	Its celebration in Aruba started, around the 1950s, influenced by the inhabitants from the nearby islands (Venezuela, St Vincent, Trinidad, Barbados, St.
690	Maarten and Anguilla) who came to work for the Oil refinery.
690	Over the years the Carnival Celebration has changed and now starts from the beginning of January till the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday with a large parade on the last Sunday of the festivities (Sunday before Ash Wednesday).
690	Tourism from the United States has recently increased the visibility of American culture on the island, with such celebrations as Halloween and Thanksgiving Day in November.
690	Infrastructure  Aruba's Queen Beatrix International Airport is located near Oranjestad.
690	According to the Aruba Airport Authority, almost 1.7 million travelers used the airport in 2005, of which 61% were Americans.
690	Aruba has two ports, Barcadera and Playa, which are located in Oranjestad.
690	The Port of Playa services all the cruise-ship lines, including Royal Caribbean, Carnival Cruise Lines, NCL, Holland America Line, Disney Cruise Line and others.
690	Nearly one million tourists enter in this port per year.
690	Aruba Ports Authority, owned and operated by the Aruban government runs these seaports.
690	Arubus is a government owned bus company.
690	Its buses operate from 3:30 am until 12:30 am 365 days a year.
690	Small private vans also provide the transportation services in certain areas such Hotel Area, San Nicolaas, Santa Cruz and Noord.
690	Utilities  Water-en Energiebedrijf (W.E.B.) Aruba NV produces potable industrial water, at the world's third largest desalination plant.
690	Average daily consumption in is about 37000 LT.
690	There are two telecommunications providers: Setar, a government based company and Digicel, which is privately owned.
690	Setar is the provider of services such as Internet, video conference, GSM wireless tech and lanetar id lines and offer the latest in telecom services.
690	Digicel is the Setar competitor in wireless technology using the GSM platform.
690	Places of interest  Arubans
691	The Articles of Confederation, formally the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, was an agreement among the 13 founding states that established the United States of America as a confederation of sovereign states and served as its first constitution.
691	Its drafting by the Continental Congress began in mid-1776, and an approved version was sent to the states for ratification in late 1777.
691	The formal ratification by all 13 states was completed in early 1781.
691	Even when not yet ratified, the Articles provided domestic and international legitimacy for the Continental Congress to direct the American Revolutionary War, conduct diplomacy with Europe and deal with territorial issues and Indian relations.
691	Nevertheless, the weak government created by the Articles became a matter of concern for key nationalists.
691	On March 4, 1789, the Articles were replaced with the U.S.
691	Constitution.
691	The new Constitution provided for a much stronger national government with a chief executive (the president), courts, and taxing powers.
691	Background and context The political push to increase cooperation among the then-loyal colonies began with the Albany Congress in 1754 and Benjamin Franklin's proposed intercolonial collaboration to help solve mutual local problems themselves; the Articles of Confederation would bear some resemblance to it.
691	Over the next two decades, some of the basic concepts it addressed would strengthen and others would weaken, particularly the degree of deserved loyalty to the crown.
691	With civil disobedience resulting in coercive and intolerable acts, and armed conflict resulting in dissidents being proclaimed rebels and outside the King's protection, any loyalty remaining shifted toward independence and how to achieve it.
691	In 1775, with events outpacing communications, the Second Continental Congress began acting as the provisional government to run the American Revolutionary War and gain the colonies their collective independence.
691	It was an era of constitution writing—most states were busy at the task—and leaders felt the new nation must have a written constitution, even though other nations did not.
691	During the war, Congress exercised an unprecedented level of political, diplomatic, military and economic authority.
691	It adopted trade restrictions, established and maintained an army, issued fiat money, created a military code and negotiated with foreign governments.
691	To trle= The Creation of ansform themselves from outlaws into a legitimate nation,  the colonists needed international recognition for their cause and foreign allies to support it.
691	In early 1776, Thomas Paine argued in the closing pages of the first edition of Common Sense that the “custom of nations” demanded a formal declaration of American independence if any European power were to mediate a peace between the Americans and Great Britain.
691	The monarchies of France and Spain in particular could not be expected to aid those they considered rebels against another legitimate monarch.
691	Foreign courts needed to have American grievances laid before them persuasively in a “manifesto” which could also reassure them that the Americans would be reliable trading partners.
691	Without such a declaration, Paine concluded, “[t]he custom of all courts is against us, and will be so, until, by an independence, we take rank with other nations.” Beyond improving their existing association, the records of the Second Continental Congress show that the need for a declaration of independence was intimately linked with the demands of international relations.
691	On June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee introduced a resolution before the Continental Congress declaring the colonies independent; at the same time he also urged Congress to resolve “to take the most effectual measures for forming foreign Alliances” and to prepare a plan of confederation for the newly independent states.
691	Congress then created three overlapping committees to draft the Declaration, a Model Treaty, and the Articles of Confederation.
691	The Declaration announced the states' entry into the international system; the model treaty was designed to establish amity and commerce with other states; and the Articles of Confederation, which established “a firm league” among the thirteen free and independent states, constituted an international agreement to set up central institutions for the conduct of vital domestic and foreign affairs.
691	Drafting On June 12, 1776, a day after appointing a committee to prepare a draft of the Declaration of Independence, the Second Continental Congress resolved to appoint a committee of 13 to prepare a draft of a constitution for a union of the states.
691	The committee  met repeatedly, and chairman John Dickinson presented their results to the Congress on July 12, 1776.
691	There were long debates on such issues as sovereignty, the exact powers to be given the confederate government, whether to have a judiciary, and voting procedures.
691	The final draft of the Articles was prepared in the summer of 1777 and the Second Continental Congress approved them for ratification by the individual states on November 15, 1777, after a year of debate.
691	In practice, the Articles were in use beginning in 1777;  the final draft of the Articles served as the de facto system of government used by the Congress ("the United States in Congress assembled") until it became de jure by final ratification on March 1, 1781; at which point Congress became the Congress of the Confederation.
691	Under the Articles, the states retained sovereignty over all governmental functions not specifically relinquished to the national government.
691	The individual articles set the rules for current and future operations of the United States government.
691	It was made capable of making war and peace, negotiating diplomatic and commercial agreements with foreign countries, and deciding disputes between the states, including their additional and contested western territories.
691	Article XIII stipulated that "their provisions shall be inviolably observed by every state" and "the Union shall be perpetual".
691	John Dickinson and Benjamin Franklin's  handwritten drafts of the Articles of Confederation are housed at the National Archives in Washington, DC.
691	Operation The Articles were created by delegates from the states in the Second Continental Congress out of a need to have "a plan of confederacy for securing the freedom, sovereignty, and independence of the United States."
691	After the war, nationalists, especially those who had been active in the Continental Army, complained that the Articles were too weak for an effective government.
691	There were no president, no executive agencies, no judiciary and no tax base.
691	The absence of a tax base meant that there was no way to pay off state and national debts from the war years except by requesting money from the states, which seldom arrived.
691	In 1788, with the approval of Congress, the Articles were replaced by the United States Constitution and the new government began operations in 1789.
691	Ratification Congress began to move for ratification of the Articles of Confederation in 1777: "Permit us, then, earnestly to recommend these articles to the immediate and dispassionate attention of the legislatures of the respective states.
691	Let them be candidly reviewed under a sense of the difficulty of combining in one system the various sentiments and interests of a continent divided into so many sovereign and independent communities, under a conviction of the absolute necessity of uniting all our councils and all our strength, to maintain and defend our common liberties...
691	The document could not become officially effective until it was ratified by all 13 colonies.
691	The first state to ratify was Virginia on December 16, 1777.
691	Dates of ratification are given as follows in American Constitutions: The ratification process dragged on for several years, stalled by the refusal of some states to rescind their claims to land in the West.
691	Maryland was the last holdout; it refused to go along until Virginia and New York agreed to cede their claims in the Ohio River Valley.
691	It took a little over three years for all states to ratify.
691	The Articles provided for a blanket acceptance of Province of Quebec (referred to as "Canada" in the Articles) into the United States if it chose to do so.
691	It did not, and the subsequent Constitution carried no such special provision of admission.
691	Article summaries Even though the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution were established by many of the same people, the two documents are very different.
691	The original five-page Articles contained a preamble, 13 articles, a conclusion, and a signatory section.
691	The preamble states that the signatory states "agree to certain articles of Confederation and perpetual Union" between the 13 states.
691	The following list contains short summaries of each of the 13 articles.
691	Establishes the name of the confederation with these words: "The Style of this confederacy shall be 'The United States of America.'" # Asserts the sovereignty of each state, except for the specific powers delegated to the confederation government, i.e.
691	"Each state retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by this Confederation expressly delegated."
691	Not being sovereign, it does not call the United States of America a "nation" or "government," but instead says, "The said States hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other, for their common defense, the security of their liberties, and their mutual and general welfare, binding themselves to assist each other, against all force offered to, or attacks made upon them, or any of them, on account of religion, sovereignty, trade, or any other pretense whatever."
691	But to instill a national feeling, "[t]he better to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and intercourse among the people of the different States in this union," it establishes equal treatment and freedom of movement for the free inhabitants of each state to pass unhindered between the states, excluding "paupers, vagabonds, and fugitives from justice."
691	All these people are entitled to equal rights established by the state into which he travels.
691	If a crime is committed in one state and the perpetrator flees to another state, he will be extradited to and tried in the state in which the crime was committed.
691	Allocates one vote in the Congress of the Confederation (the "United States in Congress Assembled") to each state, which is entitled to a delegation of between two and seven members.
691	Members of Congress are appointed by state legislatures.
691	Also, individuals may not serve more than three out of any six years.
691	Only the central government is allowed to conduct foreign political or commercial relations and to declare war.
691	No state or official may accept foreign gifts or titles, and granting any title of nobility is forbidden to all.
691	States are restrained from forming sub-national groups.
691	No state may tax or interfere with treaty stipulations already proposed.
691	No state may engage in war, without permission of Congress, unless invaded or that is imminent on the frontier; no state may maintain a peace-time standing army or navy, unless infested by pirates, but every State is required to keep ready, a well-regulated (meaning well trained), disciplined, and equipped militia, with sufficient public stores of a due number of field pieces, tents, a proper quantity of arms, ammunition and camp equipage.
691	Whenever an army is raised for common defense, colonels and military ranks below colonel will be named by the state legislatures.
691	Expenditures by the United States of America will be paid by funds raised by state legislatures, and apportioned to the states based on the real property values of each.
691	Defines the sole and exclusive right and power of the United States in Congress assembled to determine peace and war; to exchange ambassadors; to enter into treaties and alliances, with some provisos; to establish rules for deciding all cases of captures or prizes on land or water; to grant letters of marque and reprisal (documents authorizing privateers) in times of peace; to appoint courts for the trial of pirates and crimes committed on the high seas; to establish courts for appeals in all cases of captures, but no member of Congress may be appointed a judge; to set weights and measures (including coins), and for Congress to serve as a final court for disputes between states.
691	"The Committee of the States, or any nine of them, shall be authorized to execute, in the recess of Congress, such of the powers of Congress as the United States in Congress assembled, by the consent of the nine States, shall from time to time think expedient to vest them with; provided that no power be delegated to the said Committee, for the exercise of which, by the Articles of Confederation, the voice of nine States in the Congress of the United States assembled be requisite."
691	If "Canada" (as the British-held Province of Quebec was also known) accedes to this confederation, it will be admitted.
691	Reaffirms that the Confederation accepts war debt incurred by Congress befederation}}&ltore the existence of the Articles.
691	Declares that the Articles are perpetual, and can only be altered by approval of Congress with ratification by all the state legislatures.
691	While still at war with Britain, the Founding Fathers were divided between those seeking a powerful, centralized national government (the "federalists"), and those seeking a loosely structured one (the "anti federalists").
691	Jealously guarding their new independence, members of the Continental Congress arrived at a compromise solution dividing sovereignty between the states and the central government, with a unicameral legislature that protected the liberty of the individual states.
691	While calling on Congress to regulate military and monetary affairs, for example, the Articles of Confederation provided no mechanism with which to compel the States to comply with requests for either troops or revenue.
691	At times, this left the military without adequate funding, supplies or even food.
691	The end of the Revolutionary War The Treaty of Paris (1783), which ended hostilities with Great Britain, languished in Congress for months because several state representatives failed to attend sessions of the national legislature to ratify it.
691	Yet Congress had no power to enforce attendance.
691	In September 1783, George Washington complained that Congress was paralyzed.
691	Many revolutionaries had gone to their respective home countries after the war, and local government and self-rule seemed quite satisfactory.
691	Function The Army The Articles supported the Congressional direction of the Continental Army, and allowed the states to present a unified front when dealing with the European powers.
691	As a tool to build a centralized war-making government, they were largely a failure: Historian Bruce Chadwick wrote: The Continental Congress, before the Articles were approved, had promised soldiers a pension of half pay for life.
691	However Congress had no power to compel the states to fund this obligation, and as the war wound down after the victory at Yorktown the sense of urgency to support the military was no longer a factor.
691	No progress was made in Congress during the winter of 1783–84.
691	General Henry Knox, who would later become the first Secretary of War under the Constitution, blamed the weaknesses of the Articles for the inability of the government to fund the army.
691	The army had long been supportive of a strong union.
691	Knox wrote: As Congress failed to act on the petitions, Knox wrote to Gouverneur Morris, four years before the Philadelphia Convention was convened, "As the present Constitution is so defective, why do not you great men call the people together and tell them so; that is, to have a convention of the States to form a better Constitution."
691	Once the war had been won, the Continental Army was largely disbanded.
691	A very small national force was maintained to man the frontier forts and to protect against Native American attacks.
691	Meanwhile, each of the states had an army (or militia), and 11 of them had Navies.
691	The wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met.
691	In 1783, George Washington defused the Newburgh conspiracy, but riots by unpaid Pennsylvania veterans forced Congress to leave Philadelphia temporarily.
691	The Congress from time to time during the Revolutionary War requisitioned troops from the states.
691	Any contributions were voluntary, and in the debates of 1788 the Federalists (who supported the proposed new Constitution) claimed that state politicians acted unilaterally, and contributed when the Continental army protected their state's interests.
691	The Anti-Federalists claimed that state politicians understood their duty to the Union and contributed to advance its needs.
691	Dougherty (2009) concludes that generally the States' behavior validated the Federalist analysis.
691	This helps explain why the Articles of Confederation needed reforms.
691	Foreign policy Even after peace had been achieved in 1783, the weakness of the Confederation government frustrated the ability of the government to conduct foreign policy.
691	In 1789, Thomas Jefferson, concerned over the failure to fund an American naval force to confront the Barbary pirates, wrote to James Monroe, "It will be said there is no money in the treasury.
691	There never will be money in the treasury till the Confederacy shows its teeth.
691	The states must see the rod.” Furthermore, the Jay–Gardoqui Treaty with Spain in 1789 also showed weakness in foreign policy.
691	In this treaty — which was never ratified due to its immense unpopularity — the United States was to give up rights to use the Mississippi River for 25 years, which would have economically strangled the settlers west of the Appalachian Mountains.
691	Finally, due to the Confederation's military weakness, it could not compel the British army to leave frontier forts which were on American soil — forts which, in 1783, the British promised to leave, but which they delayed leaving pending U.S.
691	Loyalists and allowing them to seek compensation.
691	This incomplete British implementation of the Treaty of Paris (1783) was superseded by the implementation of Jay's Treaty in 1795 under the new U.S.
691	Constitution.
691	Taxatied by the implementation of Jaon and commerce Under the Articles of Confederation, the central government's power was kept quite limited.
691	The Confederation Congress could make decisions, but lacked enforcement powers.
691	Implementation of most decisions, including modifications to the Articles, required unanimous approval of all thirteen state legislatures.
691	Congress was denied any powers of taxation: it could only request money from the states.
691	The states often failed to meet these requests in full, leaving both Congress and the Continental Army chronically short of money.
691	As more money was printed by Congress, the continental dollars depreciated.
691	In 1779, George Washington wrote to John Jay, who was serving as the president of the Continental Congress, "that a wagon load of money will scarcely purchase a wagon load of provisions."
691	Mr.
691	Jay and the Congress responded in May by requesting $45 million from the States.
691	In an appeal to the States to comply, Jay wrote that the taxes were "the price of liberty, the peace, and the safety of yourselves and posterity."
691	He argued that Americans should avoid having it said "that America had no sooner become independent than she became insolvent" or that "her infant glories and growing fame were obscured and tarnished by broken contracts and violated faith."
691	The States did not respond with any of the money requested from them.
691	Congress had also been denied the power to regulate either foreign trade or interstate commerce and, as a result, all of the States maintained control over their own trade policies.
691	The states and the Confederation Congress both incurred large debts during the Revolutionary War, and how to repay those debts became a major issue of debate following the War.
691	Some States paid off their war debts and others did not.
691	Federal assumption of the states' war debts became a major issue in the deliberations of the Constitutional Convention.
691	Accomplishments of the Confederation Nevertheless, the Confederation Congress did take two actions with long lasting impact.
691	The Land Ordinance of 1785 and Northwest Ordinance created territorial government, set up protocols for the admission of new states, the division of land into useful units, and set aside land in each township for public use.
691	This system represented a sharp break from imperial colonization, as in Europe, and provided the basis for the rest of American continental expansion through the 19th Century.
691	The Land Ordinance of 1785 established both the general practices of land surveying in the west and northwest and the land ownership provisions used throughout the later westward expansion beyond the Mississippi River.
691	Frontier lands were surveyed into the now-familiar squares of land called the township (36 square miles), the section (one square mile), and the quarter section (160 acres).
691	This system was carried forward to most of the States west of the Mississippi (excluding areas of Texas and California that had already been surveyed and divided up by the Spanish Empire).
691	Then, when the Homestead Act was enacted in 1867, the quarter section became the basic unit of land that was granted to new settler-farmers.
691	The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 noted the agreement of the original states to give up northwestern land claims, organized the Northwest Territory and thus cleared the way for the entry of five new states, and part of a sixth to the Union.
691	To be specific, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia gave up all of their claims to land north of the Ohio River and west of the (present) western border of Pennsylvania.
691	Over several decades a number of new states were formed from this land: Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, and the part of Minnesota east of the Mississippi River.
691	The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 also made great advances in the abolition of slavery.
691	New states admitted to the union in said territory would never be slave states.
691	America under the articles The peace treaty left the United States independent and at peace but with an unsettled governmental structure.
691	The Articles envisioned a permanent confederation, but granted to the Congress—the only federal institution—little power to finance itself or to ensure that its resolutions were enforced.
691	There was no president and no national court.
691	Although historians generally agree that the Articles were too weak to hold the fast-growing nation together, they do give credit to the settlement of the western issue, as the states voluntarily turned over their lands to national control.
691	By 1783, with the end of the British blockade, the new nation was regaining its prosperity.
691	However, trade opportunities were restricted by the mercantilism of the British and French empires.
691	The ports of the British West Indies were closed to all staple products which were not carried in British ships.
691	France and Spain established similar policies.
691	Simultaneously, new manufacturers faced sharp competition from British products which were suddenly available again.
691	Political unrest in several states and efforts by debtors to use popular government to erase their debts increased the anxiety of the political and economic elites which had led the Revolution.
691	The apparent inability of the Congress to redeem the public obligations (debts) incurred during the war, or to become a forum for productive cooperation among the states to encourage commerce and economic development, only aggravated a gloomy situation.
691	In 1786–87, Shays' Rebellion, an uprising of farmers in western Massachusetts against the state court system, threatened the stability of state government.
691	The Continental Congress printed paper money which was so depreciated that it ceased to pass as currency, spawning the expression "not worth a continental".
691	Congress could not levy taxes and could only make requisitions upon the States.
691	Less than a million and a half dollars came into the treasury between 1781 and 1784, although the governors had been asked for two million in 1783 alone.
691	When Adams went to London in 1785 as the first representative of the United States, he found it impossible to secure a treaty for unrestricted commerce.
691	Demands were made for favors and there was no assurance that individual states would agree to a treaty.
691	Adams stated it was necessary for the States to confer the power of passing navigation laws to Congress, or that the States themselves pass retaliatory acts against Great Britain.
691	Congress had already requested and failed to get power over navigation laws.
691	Meanwhile, each State acted individually against Great Britain to little effect.
691	When other New England states closed their ports to British shipping, Connecticut hastened to profit by opening its ports.
691	By 1787 Congress was unable to protitle= John Adams: A Life |yeatect manufacturing and shipping.
691	State legislatures were unable or unwilling to resist attacks upon private contracts and public credit.
691	Land speculators expected no rise in values when the government could not defend its borders nor protect its frontier population.
691	The idea of a convention to revise the Articles of Confederation grew in favor.
691	Alexander Hamilton realized while serving as Washington's top aide that a strong central government was necessary to avoid foreign intervention and allay the frustrations due to an ineffectual Congress.
691	Hamilton led a group of like-minded nationalists, won Washington's endorsement, and convened the Annapolis Convention in 1786 to petition Congress to call a constitutional convention to meet in Philadelphia to remedy the long-term crisis.
691	Signatures The Second Continental Congress approved the Articles for distribution to the states on November 15, 1777.
691	A copy was made for each state and one was kept by the Congress.
691	The copies sent to the states for ratification were unsigned, and a cover letter had only the signatures of Henry Laurens and Charles Thomson, who were the President and Secretary to the Congress.
691	The Articles, however, were unsigned, and the date was blank.
691	Congress began the signing process by examining their copy of the Articles on June 27, 1778.
691	They ordered a final copy prepared (the one in the National Archives), and that delegates should inform the secretary of their authority for ratification.
691	On July 9, 1778, the prepared copy was ready.
691	They dated it, and began to sign.
691	They also requested each of the remaining states to notify its delegation when ratification was completed.
691	On that date, delegates present from New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and South Carolina signed the Articles to indicate that their states had ratified.
691	New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland could not, since their states had not ratified.
691	North Carolina and Georgia also didn't sign that day, since their delegations were absent.
691	After the first signing, some delegates signed at the next meeting they attended.
691	For example, John Wentworth of New Hampshire added his name on August 8.
691	John Penn was the first of North Carolina's delegates to arrive (on July 10), and the delegation signed the Articles on July 21, 1778.
691	The other states had to wait until they ratified the Articles and notified their Congressional delegation.
691	Georgia signed on July 24, New Jersey on November 26, and Delaware on February 12, 1779.
691	Maryland refused to ratify the Articles until every state had ceded its western land claims.
691	On February 2, 1781, the much-awaited decision was taken by the Maryland General Assembly in Annapolis.
691	As the last piece of business during the afternoon Session, "among engrossed Bills" was "signed and sealed by Governor Thomas Sim Lee in the Senate Chamber, in the presence of the members of both Houses...
691	Act to empower the delegates of this state in Congress to subscribe and ratify the articles of confederation" and perpetual union among the states.
691	The Senate then adjourned "to the first Monday in August next."
691	The decision of Maryland to ratify the Articles was reported to the Continental Congress on February 12.
691	The formal signing of the Articles by the Maryland delegates took place in Philadelphia at noon time on March 1, 1781 and was celebrated in the afternoon.
691	With these events, the Articles entered into force and the United States came into being as a united, sovereign and national state.
691	Congress had debated the Articles for over a year and a half, and the ratification process had taken nearly three and a half years.
691	Many participants in the original debates were no longer delegates, and some of the signers had only recently arrived.
691	The Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union were signed by a group of men who were never present in the Congress at the same time.
691	Signers The signers and the states they represented were: Connecticut * Roger Sherman * Samuel Huntington * Oliver Wolcott * Titus Hosmer * Andrew Adams Delaware * Thomas McKean * John Dickinson * Nicholas Van Dyke Georgia * John Walton * Edward Telfair * Edward Langworthy Maryland * John Hanson * Daniel Carroll Massachusetts Bay * John Hancock * Samuel Adams * Elbridge Gerry * Francis Dana * James Lovell * Samuel Holten New Hampshire * Josiah Bartlett * John Wentworth Jr.
691	New Jersey * John Witherspoon * Nathaniel Scudder New York * James Duane * Francis Lewis * William Duer * Gouverneur Morris North Carolina * John Penn * Cornelius Harnett * John Williams Pennsylvania * Robert Morris * Daniel Roberdeau * Jonathan Bayard Smith * William Clingan * Joseph Reed Rhode Island and Providence Plantations * William Ellery * Henry Marchant * John Collins South Carolina * Henry Laurens * William Henry Drayton * John Mathews * Richard Hutson * Thomas Heyward Jr.
691	Virginia * Richard Henry Lee * John Banister * Thomas Adams * John Harvie * Francis Lightfoot Lee Roger Sherman (Connecticut) was the only person to sign all four great state papers of the United States: the Continental Association, the United States Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution.
691	Robert Morris (Pennsylvania) was the only person besides Sherman to sign three of the great state papers of the United States: the United States Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution.
691	John Dickinson (Delaware), Daniel Carroll (Maryland) and Gouverneur Morris (New York), along with Sherman and Robert Morris, were the only five people to sign both the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution (Gouverneur Morris represented Pennsylvania when signing the Constitution).
691	Presidents of the Congress The following list is of those who led the Congress of the Confederation under the Articles of Confederation as the Presidents of the United States in Congress Assembled.
691	Under the Articles, the president was the presiding officer of Congress,es in Congre chaired the Committee of the States when Congress was in recess, and performed other administrative functions.
691	He was not, however, an executive in the way the successor President of the United States is a chief executive, since all of the functions he executed were under the direct control of Congress.
691	For a full list of Presidents of the Congress Assembled and Presidents under the two Continental Congresses before the Articles, see President of the Continental Congress.
691	Gallery Revision and replacement On January 21, 1786, the Virginia Legislature, following James Madison's recommendation, invited all the states to send delegates to Annapolis, Maryland to discuss ways to reduce interstate conflict.
691	At what came to be known as the Annapolis Convention, the few state delegates in attendance endorsed a motion that called for all states to meet in Philadelphia in May 1787 to discuss ways to improve the Articles of Confederation in a "Grand Convention."
691	Although the states' representatives to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia were only authorized to amend the Articles, the representatives held secret, closed-door sessions and wrote a new constitution.
691	The new Constitution gave much more power to the central government, but characterization of the result is disputed.
691	The general goal of the authors was to get close to a republic as defined by the philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment, while trying to address the many difficulties of the interstate relationships.
691	Historian Forrest McDonald, using the ideas of James Madison from Federalist 39, describes the change this way: In May 1786, Charles Pinckney of South Carolina proposed that Congress revise the Articles of Confederation.
691	Recommended changes included granting Congress power over foreign and domestic commerce, and providing means for Congress to collect money from state treasuries.
691	Unanimous approval was necessary to make the alterations, however, and Congress failed to reach a consensus.
691	The weakness of the Articles in establishing an effective unifying government was underscored by the threat of internal conflict both within and between the states, especially after Shays' Rebellion threatened to topple the state government of Massachusetts.
691	Historian Ralph Ketcham comments on the opinions of Patrick Henry, George Mason, and other antifederalists who were not so eager to give up the local autonomy won by the revolution: Historians have given many reasons for the perceived need to replace the articles in 1787.
691	Jillson and Wilson (1994) point to the financial weakness as well as the norms, rules and institutional structures of the Congress, and the propensity to divide along sectional lines.
691	Rakove (1988) identifies several factors that explain the collapse of the Confederation.
691	The lack of compulsory direct taxation power was objectionable to those wanting a strong centralized state or expecting to benefit from such power.
691	It could not collect customs after the war because tariffs were vetoed by Rhode Island.
691	Rakove concludes that their failure to implement national measures "stemmed not from a heady sense of independence but rather from the enormous difficulties that all the states encountered in collecting taxes, mustering men, and gathering supplies from a war-weary populace."
691	The second group of factors Rakove identified derived from the substantive nature of the problems the Continental Congress confronted after 1783, especially the inability to create a strong foreign policy.
691	Finally, the Confederation's lack of coercive power reduced the likelihood for profit to be made by political means, thus potential rulers were uninspired to seek power.
691	When the war ended in 1783, certain special interests had incentives to create a new "merchant state," much like the British state people had rebelled against.
691	In particular, holders of war scrip and land speculators wanted a central government to pay off scrip at face value and to legalize western land holdings with disputed claims.
691	Also, manufacturers wanted a high tariff as a barrier to foreign goods, but competition among states made this impossible without a central government.
691	Political scientist David C.
691	Hendrickson writes that two prominent political leaders in the Confederation, John Jay of New York and Thomas Burke of North Carolina believed that "the authority of the congress rested on the prior acts of the several states, to which the states gave their voluntary consent, and until those obligations were fulfilled, neither nullification of the authority of congress, exercising its due powers, nor secession from the compact itself was consistent with the terms of their original pledges."
691	Closing down According to their own terms for modification (Article XIII), the Articles would still have been in effect until 1790, the year in which the last of the 13 states ratified the new Constitution.
691	The Congress under the Articleor SYNTH, thiss continued to sit until November 1788, overseeing the adoption of the new Constitution by the states, and setting elections.
691	By that date, 11 of the 13 states had ratified the new Constitution.
691	On September 13, 1788, it published an announcement that the new Constitution had been ratified by the necessary nine states, set the first Wednesday in February 1789 for the presidential electors to meet and select a new president, and set the first Wednesday of March 1789 as the day the new government would take over and the government under the Articles of Confederation would come to an end.
691	On that same September 13, it determined that New York would remain the national capital.

698	The Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest of the world's oceanic divisions.
698	With a total area of about , it covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area.
698	The first part of its name refers to Atlas of Greek mythology, making the Atlantic the "Sea of Atlas".
698	The oldest known mention of "Atlantic" is in The Histories of Herodotus around 450 BC (Hdt.
698	Atlantis thalassa (Greek: Ἀτλαντὶς θάλασσα; English: Sea of Atlas).
698	The term Ethiopic Ocean, derived from Ethiopia, was applied to the southern Atlantic as late as the mid-19th century.
698	Before Europeans discovered other oceans, the term "ocean" itself was synonymous with the waters beyond the Strait of Gibraltar that we now know as the Atlantic.
698	The early Greeks believed this ocean to be a gigantic river encircling the world.
698	The Atlantic Ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending longitudinally between Eurasia and Africa to the east, and the Americas to the west.
698	As one component of the interconnected global ocean, it is connected in the north to the Arctic Ocean (which is sometimes considered  a sea of the Atlantic), to the Pacific Ocean in the southwest, the Indian Ocean in the southeast, and the Southern Ocean in the south.
698	Other definitions describe the Atlantic as extending southward to Antarctica.) The equator subdivides it into the North Atlantic Ocean and South Atlantic Ocean.
698	Geography The Atlantic Ocean is bounded on the west by North and South America.
698	It connects to the Arctic Ocean through the Denmark Strait, Greenland Sea, Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea.
698	To the east, the boundaries of the ocean proper are Europe; the Strait of Gibraltar (where it connects with the Mediterranean Sea–one of its marginal seas–and, in turn, the Black Sea, both of which also touch upon Asia) and Africa.
698	In the southeast, the Atlantic merges into the Indian Ocean.
698	The 20° East meridian, running south from Cape Agulhas to Antarctica defines its border.
698	Some authorities show it extending south to Antarctica, while others show it bounded at the 60° parallel by the Southern Ocean.
698	In the southwest, the Drake Passage connects it to the Pacific Ocean.
698	The man-made Panama Canal links the Atlantic and Pacific.
698	Besides those mentioned, other large bodies of water adjacent to the Atlantic are the Caribbean Sea; the Gulf of Mexico; Hudson Bay; the Arctic Ocean; the Mediterranean Sea; the North Sea; the Baltic Sea and the Celtic Sea.
698	Covering approximately 22% of Earth's surface, the Atlantic is second in size to the Pacific.
698	With its adjacent seas, it occupies an area of about 106400000 km2; without them, it has an area of 82400000 km2.
698	The land that drains into the Atlantic covers four times that of either the Pacific or Indian oceans.
698	The volume of the Atlantic with its adjacent seas is 354,700,000 cubic kilometers (85,100,000 cu mi) and without them 323,600,000 cubic kilometres (77,640,000 cu mi).
698	The average depth of the Atlantic, with its adjacent seas, is 3339 m; without them it is 3926 m.
698	The greatest depth, Milwaukee Deep with 8380 m, is in the Puerto Rico Trench.
698	The Atlantic's width varies from 1538 nmi between Brazil and Sierra Leone to over 3450 nmi in the south.
698	Cultural significance Transatlantic travel played a major role in the expansion of Western civilization into the Americas.
698	It is the Atlantic that separates the "Old World" from the "New World".
698	In modern times, some idioms refer to the ocean in a humorously diminutive way as the Pond, describing both the geographical and cultural divide between North America and Europe, in particular between the English-speaking nations of both continents.
698	Many British people refer to the United States and Canada as "across the pond", and vice versa.
698	The "Black Atlantic" refers to the role of this ocean in shaping black people's history, not least in diasporas.
698	Irish migration to the US is meant when the term "The Green Atlantic" is used.
698	The "Red Atlantic" is a relatively new term that refers to seafarers as proletarians and revolutionaries who historically resisted exploitation at sea and forged a new multicultural and polyglot Atlantic working-class.
698	Ocean bottom The principal feature of the bathymetry (bottom topography) is a submarine mountain range called the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.
698	It extends from Iceland in the north to approximately 58° South latitude, reaching a maximum width of about 860 nmi.
698	A great rift valley also extends along the ridge over most of its length.
698	The depth of water at the apex of the ridge is less than 2700 m in most places, while the bottom of the ridge is three times as deep.
698	Several peaks rise above the water and form islands.
698	The South Atlantic Ocean has an additional submarine ridge, the Walvis Ridge.
698	The Mid-Atlantic Ridge separates the Atlantic Ocean into two large troughs with depths from 3700 -.
698	Transverse ridges running between the continents and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge divide the ocean floor into numerous basins.
698	Some of the larger basins are the Blake, Guiana, North American, Cape Verde, and Canaries basins in the North Atlantic.
698	The largest South Atlantic basins are the Angola, Cape, Argentina, and Brazil basins.
698	The deep ocean floor is thought to be fairly flat with occasional deeps, abyssal plains, trenches, seamounts, basins, plateaus, canyons, and some guyots.
698	Various shelves along the margins of the continents constitute about 11% of the bottom topography with few deep channels cut across the continental rise.
698	Ocean floor trenches and seamounts: * Puerto Rico Trench, in the North Atlantic, is the deepest trench at 8605 m * Laurentian Abyss is found off the eastern coast of Canada * South Sandwich Trench reaches a depth of 8428 m * Romanche Trench is located near the equator and reaches a depth of about 7454 m.
698	Ocean sediments are composed of: * Terrigenous deposits with land origins, consisting of sand, mud, and rock particles formed by erosion, weathering, and volcanic activity on land washed to sea.
698	These materials are found mostly on the continental shelves and are thickest near large river mouths or off desert coasts.
698	Pelagic deposits, which contain the remains of organisms that sink to the ocean floor, include red clays and Globigerina, pteropod, and siliceous oozes.
698	Covering most of the ocean floor and ranging in thickness from 60 - they are thickest in the convergence belts, notably at the Hamilton Ridge and in upwelling zones.
698	Authigenic deposits consist of such materials as manganese nodules.
698	They occur where sedimentation proceeds slowly or where currents sort the deposits, such as in the Hewett Curve.
698	Water characteristics On average, the Atlantic is the saltiest major ocean; surface water salinity in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand (3.3 – 3.7%) by mass and varies with latitude and season.
698	Evaporation, precipitation, river inflow and sea ice melting influence surface salinity values.
698	Although the lowest salinity values are just north of the equator (because of heavy tropical rainfall), in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers enter.
698	Maximum salinity values occur at about 25° north and south, in subtropica occur at aboul regions with low rainfall and high evaporation.
698	Surface water temperatures, which vary with latitude, current systems, and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy, range from below .
698	Maximum temperatures occur north of the equator, and minimum values are found in the polar regions.
698	In the middle latitudes, the area of maximum temperature variations, values may vary by 7–8 °C (12–15°F).
698	The Atlantic Ocean consists of four major water masses.
698	The North and South Atlantic central waters make up the surface.
698	The sub-Antarctic intermediate water extends to depths of 1000 m.
698	The North Atlantic Deep Water reaches depths of as much as 4000 m.
698	The Antarctic Bottom Water occupies ocean basins at depths greater than 4,000 metres.
698	Within the North Atlantic, ocean currents isolate the Sargasso Sea, a large elongated body of water, with above average salinity.
698	The Sargasso Sea contains large amounts of seaweed and is also the spawning ground for both the European eel and the American eel.
698	The Coriolis effect circulates North Atlantic water in a clockwise direction, whereas South Atlantic water circulates counter-clockwise.
698	The south tides in the Atlantic Ocean are semi-diurnal; that is, two high tides occur during each 24 lunar hours.
698	In latitudes above 40° North some east-west oscillation occurs.
698	Climate Climate is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as winds.
698	Because of the ocean's great capacity to store and release heat, maritime climates are more moderate and have less extreme seasonal variations than inland climates.
698	Precipitation can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from water temperatures.
698	The oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation.
698	Climatic zones vary with latitude; the warmest zones stretch across the Atlantic north of the equator.
698	The coldest zones are in high latitudes, with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice.
698	Ocean currents influence climate by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions.
698	The winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents influence adjacent land areas.
698	The Gulf Stream and its northern extension towards Europe, the North Atlantic Drift, for example, warms the atmosphere of the British Isles and north-western Europe and influences weather and climate as far south as the northern Mediterranean.
698	The cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of eastern Canada (the Grand Banks of Newfoundland area) and Africa's north-western coast.
698	In general, winds transport moisture and air over land areas.
698	Hurricanes develop in the southern part of the North Atlantic Ocean.
698	More  local   particular weather examples could be found in examples such as the; Azores High, Benguela Current, Nor'easter.
698	History The Atlantic Ocean appears to be the second youngest of the five oceans.
698	It did not exist prior to 130 million years ago, when the continents that formed from the breakup of the ancestral super continent Pangaea were drifting apart from seafloor spreading.
698	The Atlantic has been extensively explored since the earliest settlements along its shores.
698	The Vikings, the Portuguese, and the Spaniards were the most famous among early explorers.
698	After Columbus, European exploration rapidly accelerated, and many new trade routes were established.
698	As a result, the Atlantic became and remains the major artery between Europe and the Americas (known as transatlantic trade).
698	Scientific explorations include the Challenger expedition, the German Meteor expedition, Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and the United States Navy Hydrographic Office.
698	Notable crossings * Around 980 – 982, Eric the Red discovered Greenland, geographically and geologically a part of the Americas.
698	In the year 1000, the Icelander Leif Ericson was the first European to set foot on North American soil, corresponding to today's Eastern coast of Canada, i.
698	Newfoundland and Labrador, including the area of land named "Vinland" by Ericson.
698	The Norse discovery was documented in the 13th century Icelandic Sagas and was corroborated by recent L'Anse aux Meadows archeological evidence.
698	Around 1010, Thorfinnr Karlsefni led an attempted Viking settlement in North America with 160 settlers, but was later driven off by the natives.
698	His son Snorri Thorfinnsson was the first American born (somewhere between 1010 and 1013) to European (Icelandic) immigrant parents.
698	In 1419 and 1427, Portuguese navigators reached Madeira and Azores, respectively.

698	On April 15, 1912 the RMS Titanic sank after hitting an iceberg with a loss of more than 1,500 lives.
698	First Battle of the Atlantic took place.
698	In 1919, the American NC-4 became the first seaplane to cross the Atlanticc took place.
698	In 1919, (though it made a couple of landings on islands and the sea along the way, and taxied several hundred miles).
698	Later in 1919, a British aeroplane piloted by Alcock and Brown made the first non-stop transatlantic flight, from Newfoundland to Ireland.
698	In 1921, the British were the first to cross the North Atlantic in an airship.
698	In 1922, Portuguese aviators Sacadura Cabral and Gago Coutinho were the First aerial crossing of the South Atlantic on a seaplane connecting Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro.
698	In 1927, Charles Lindbergh made the first solo non-stop transatlantic flight in an aircraft (between New York City and Paris).
698	In 1931, Bert Hinkler made the first solo non-stop transatlantic flight across the South Atlantic in an aircraft.
698	In 1932, Amelia Earhart became the first female to make a solo flight across the Atlantic * 1939–1945, the Second Battle of the Atlantic.
698	Nearly 3,700 Allied ships were sunk at a cost of 783 German U-boats.
698	In 1952, Ann Davison was the first woman to single-handedly sail the Atlantic Ocean.
698	In 1965, Robert Manry crossed the Atlantic from the U.S.
698	England non-stop in a 13.5 foot (4.05 meters) sailboat named "Tinkerbell".
698	Several others also crossed the Atlantic in very small sailboats in the 1960s, none of them non-stop, though.
698	In 1969 and 1970 Thor Heyerdahl launched expeditions to cross the Atlantic in boats built from papyrus.
698	He succeeded in crossing the Atlantic from Morocco to Barbados after a two-month voyage of 6,100 km with Ra II in 1970, thus conclusively proving that boats such as the Ra could have sailed with the Canary Current across the Atlantic in prehistoric times.
698	In 1980, Gérard d'Aboville was the first man to cross the Atlantic Ocean rowing solo.
698	In 1984, Amyr Klink crossed the south atlantic rowing solo from Namibia to Brazil in 100 days.
698	In 1984, five Argentines sail in a 10-meter-long raft made from tree trunks named Atlantis from Canary Islands and after 52 days 3000 mi journey arrived to Venezuela in an attempt to prove travelers from Africa may have crossed the Atlantic before Christopher Columbus.
698	In 1994, Guy Delage was the first man to allegedly swim across the Atlantic Ocean (with the help of a kick board, from Cape Verde to Barbados).
698	In 1998, Benoît Lecomte was the first man to swim across the northern Atlantic Ocean without a kick board, stopping for only one week in the Azores.
698	In 1999, after rowing for 81 days and 4,767 kilometres (2,962 mi), Tori Murden became the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean by rowboat alone when she reached Guadeloupe from the Canary Islands.
698	Ethiopic Ocean The Aethiopian Sea, Ethiopic Ocean or Ethiopian Ocean (Okeanos Aithiopos), is an old name for what is now called the South Atlantic Ocean, which is separated from the North Atlantic Ocean by a narrow region between Natal, Brazil and Monrovia, Liberia.
698	The use of this term illustrates a past trend towards referring to the whole continent of Africa by the name Aethiopia.
698	The modern nation of Ethiopia, in northeast Africa, is nowhere near the Ethiopic Ocean, which would be said to lie off the west coast of Africa.
698	The term Ethiopian Ocean sometimes appeared until the mid-19th century, as e.g.
698	The Dutch colony of the Cape of Good Hope by L.S.
698	Rochette, MDCCXCV, published by W.
698	Faden in London in 1795.
698	Economy The Atlantic has contributed significantly to the development and economy of surrounding countries.
698	Besides major transatlantic transportation and communication routes, the Atlantic offers abundant petroleum deposits in the sedimentary rocks of the continental shelves.
698	The Atlantic hosts the world's richest fishing resources, especially in the waters covering the shelves.
698	The major fish are cod, haddock, hake, herring, and mackerel.
698	The most productive areas include Newfoundland's Grand Banks, the Nova Scotia shelf, Georges Bank off Cape Cod, the Bahama Banks, the waters around Iceland, the Irish Sea, the Dogger Bank of the North Sea, and the Falkland Banks.
698	Eel, lobster, and whales appear in great quantities.
698	Various international treaties attempt to reduce pollution caused by environmental threats such as oil spills, marine debris, and the incineration of toxic wastes at sea.
698	Terrain From October to June the surface is usually covered with sea ice in the Labrador Sea, Denmark Strait, and Baltic Sea.
698	A clockwise warm-water gyre occupies the northern Atlantic, and a counter-clockwise warm-water gyre appears in the southern Atlantic.
698	The Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a rugged north-south centerline for the entire Atlantic basin, first discovered by the Challenger Expedition dominates the ocean floor.
698	This was formed by the vulcanism that also formed the ocean floor and the islands rising from it.
698	The Atlantic has irregular coasts indented by numerous bays, gulfs, and seas.
698	These include the Norwegian Sea, Baltic Sea, North Sea, Labrador Sea, Black Sea, Gulf of Saint Lawrence, Bay of Fundy, Gulf of Maine, Mediterranean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea.
698	Islands include Newfoundland (including hundreds of surrounding islands), Greenland, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Great Britain (including numerous surrounding islands), Ireland, Rockall, Sable Island, Azores, St.
698	Pierre and Miquelon, Madeira, Bermuda, Canary Islands, Caribbean, Cape Verde, São Tomé and Príncipe, Annobón Province, Fernando de Noronha, Rocas Atoll, Ascension Island, Saint Helena, Trindade and Martim Vaz, Tristan da Cunha, Gough Islascension Island, Snd (Also known as Diego Alvarez), Falkland Islands, Tierra del Fuego, South Georgia Island, South Sandwich Islands, and Bouvet Island.
698	Natural resources The Atlantic harbors petroleum and gas fields, fish, marine mammals (seals and whales), sand and gravel aggregates, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules, and precious stones.
698	Natural hazards Icebergs are common from February to August in the Davis Strait, Denmark Strait, and the northwestern Atlantic and have been spotted as far south as Bermuda and Madeira.
698	Ships are subject to superstructure icing in the extreme north from October to May.
698	Persistent fog can be a maritime hazard from May to September, as can hurricanes north of the equator (May to December).
698	The United States' southeast coast has a long history of shipwrecks due to its many shoals and reefs.
698	The Virginia and North Carolina coasts were particularly dangerous.

700	Arthur Schopenhauer (22 February 1788 – 21 September 1860) was a German philosopher best known for his book, The World as Will and Representation, in which he claimed that our world is driven by a continually dissatisfied will, continually seeking satisfaction.
700	Influenced by Eastern thought, he maintained that the "truth was recognized by the sages of India"; consequently, his solutions to suffering were similar to those of Vedantic and Buddhist thinkers (i.e.
700	"transcendental ideality" led him to accept atheism and learn from Christian philosophy.
700	At age 25, he published his doctoral dissertation, On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, which examined the four distinct aspects of experience in the phenomenal world; consequently, he has been influential in the history of phenomenology.
700	He has influenced a long list of thinkers, including Friedrich Nietzsche, Richard Wagner, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Erwin Schrödinger, Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Otto Rank, Carl Jung, Joseph Campbell, Leo Tolstoy, Thomas Mann, and Jorge Luis Borges.
700	Life  Arthur Schopenhauer was born in the city of Danzig (Gdańsk), on Heiligegeistgasse (known in the present day as Św.
700	Ducha 47), the son of Johanna Schopenhauer (née Trosiener) and Heinrich Floris Schopenhauer, both descendants of wealthy German Patrician families.
700	When the Kingdom of Prussia annexed the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth city of Danzig in 1793, Schopenhauer's family moved to Hamburg.
700	In 1805, Schopenhauer's father may have committed suicide.
700	Shortly thereafter, Schopenhauer's mother Johanna moved to Weimar, then the centre of German literature, to pursue her writing career.
700	After one year, Schopenhauer left the family business in Hamburg to join her.
700	As early as 1799, he started playing the flute.
700	He became a student at the University of Göttingen in 1809.
700	There he studied metaphysics and psychology under Gottlob Ernst Schulze, the author of Aenesidemus, who advised him to concentrate on Plato and Immanuel Kant.
700	In Berlin, from 1811 to 1812, he had attended lectures by the prominent post-Kantian philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte and the theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher.
700	In 1814, Schopenhauer began his seminal work The World as Will and Representation (Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung).
700	He finished it in 1818 and published it the following year.
700	In Dresden in 1819, Schopenhauer fathered, with a servant, an illegitimate daughter who was born and died the same year.
700	In 1820, Schopenhauer became a lecturer at the University of Berlin.
700	He scheduled his lectures to coincide with those of the famous philosopher G.
700	W.
700	F.
700	Hegel, whom Schopenhauer described as a "clumsy charlatan."
700	However, only five students turned up to Schopenhauer's lectures, and he dropped out of academia.
700	A late essay, On University Philosophy, expressed his resentment towards the work conducted in academies.
700	While in Berlin, Schopenhauer was named as a defendant in a lawsuit initiated by a woman named Caroline Marquet.
700	She asked for damages, alleging that Schopenhauer had pushed her.
700	According to Schopenhauer's court testimony, she deliberately annoyed him by raising her voice while standing right outside his door.
700	Marquet alleged that the philosopher had assaulted and battered her after she refused to leave his doorway.
700	Her companion testified that she saw Marquet prostrate outside his apartment.
700	Because Marquet won the lawsuit, Schopenhauer made payments to her for the next twenty years.
700	When she died, he wrote on a copy of her death certificate, Obit anus, abit onus ("The old woman dies, the burden is lifted").
700	In 1821, he fell in love with nineteen-year old opera singer, Caroline Richter (called Medon), and had a relationship with her for several years.
700	He discarded marriage plans, however, writing, "Marrying means to halve one's rights and double one's duties," and "Marrying means to grasp blindfolded into a sack hoping to find an eel amongst an assembly of snakes."
700	When he was forty-three years old, seventeen-year old Flora Weiss recorded rejecting him in her diary.
700	Schopenhauer had a notably strained relationship with his mother Johanna Schopenhauer.
700	After his father's death, Arthur Schopenhauer endured two long years of drudgery as a merchant, in honor of his dead father.
700	Then his mother retired to Weimar, and Arthur Schopenhauer dedicated himself wholly to studies in the gymnasium of Gotha.
700	He left it in disgust after seeing one of the masters lampooned, and went to live with his mother.
700	But by that time she had already opened her famous salon, and Arthur was not compatible with the vain, ceremonious ways of the salon.
700	He was also disgusted by the ease with which Johanna Schopenhauer had forgotten his father's memory.
700	Consequently, he attempted university life.
700	There, he wrote his first book, On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason.
700	His mother informed him that the book was incomprehensible and it was unlikely that anyone would ever buy a copy.
700	In a fit of temper Arthur Schopenhauer told her that his work would be read long after the "rubbish" she wrote would have been totally forgotten.
700	In 1831, a cholera epidemic broke out in Berlin and Schopenhauer left the city.
700	Schopenhauer settled permanently in Frankfurt in 1833, where he remained for the next twenty-seven years, living alone except for a succession of pet poodles named Atman and Butz.
700	The numerous notes that he made during these years, amongst others on aging, were published posthumously under the title Senilia.
700	Schopenhauer had a robust constitution, but in 1860 his health began to deteriorate.
700	He died of heart failure on 21 September 1860, while sitting on his couch with his cat at home.
700	He was 72.
700	Thought  Philosophy of the "Will"  A key focus of Schopenhauer was his investigation of individual motivation.
700	Before Schopenhauer, Hegel had popularized the concept of Zeitgeist, the idea that society consisted of a collective consciousness which moved in a distinct direction, dictating the actions of its members.
700	Schopenhauer, a reader of both Kant and Hegel, criticized their logical optimism and the belief that individual morality could be determined by society and reason.
700	Schopenhauer believed that humans were motivated by only their own basic desires, or  ("Will to Live"), which directed all of mankind.
700	For Schopenhauer, human desire was futile, illogical, directionless, and, by extension, so was all human action in the world.
700	He wrote "Man can indeed do what he wants, but he cannot will what he wants".
700	In this sense, he adhered to the Fichtean principle of idealism: “the world is for a subject”.
700	This idealism so presented, immediately commits it to an ethical attitude, unlike the purely epistemological concerns of Descartes and Berkeley.
700	To Schopenhauer, the Will is a malignant,  metaphysical existence which controls not only the actions of individual, intelligent agents, but ultimately all observable phenomena; an evil to be terminated via mankind's duties: asceticism and chastity.
700	He is credited with one of the most famous opening lines of philosophy: “The world is my representation”.
700	Will, for Schopenhauer, is what Kant called the "thing-in-itself."
700	Nietzsche was greatly influenced by this idea of Will, while developing it in a different direction.
700	Art and aesthetics  For Schopenhauer, human desiring, "willing," and craving cause suffering or pain.
700	A temporary way to escape this pain is through aesthetic contemplation (a method comparable to Zapffe's "Sublimation").
700	Aesthetic contemplation allows one to escape this pain—albeit temporarily—because it stops one perceiving the world as mere presentation.
700	Instead, one no longer perceives the world as an object of perception (therefore as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds; time, space and causality) from which one is separated; rather one becomes one with that perception:"one can thus no longer separate the perceiver from the perception" (The World as Will and Representation, section 34).
700	From this immersion with the world one no longer views oneself as an individual who suffers in the world due to one's individual will but, rather, becomes a "subject of cognition" to a perception that is "Pure, will-less, timeless" (section 34) where the essence, "ideas," of the world are shown.
700	Art is the practical consequence of this brief aesthetic contemplation as it attempts to depict one's immersion with the world, thus tries to depict the essence/pure ideas of the world.
700	Music, for Schopenhauer, was the purest form of art because it was the one that depicted the will itself without it appearing as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds, therefore as an individual object.
700	According to Daniel Albright, "Schopenhauer thought that music was the only art that did not merely copy ideas, but actually embodied the will itself."
700	He deemed music to be a timeless, universal, language which is comprehended everywhere, and can imbue global enthusiasm, if in possession of a significant melody.
700	Ethics  Schopenhauer's moral theory proposed that only compassion can drive moral acts.
700	According to Schopenhauer, acts of compassion eye only the good of the object of the acts, that is, they cannot be inspired by either the prospect of personal utility or the feeling of duty.
700	Mankind can also be guided by egoipect of personal utility or the feesm and malice.
700	Egotistic acts are those guided by self-interest, desire for pleasure or happiness.
700	Schopenhauer believed most of our deeds belong to this class.
700	Acts of malice are different from egotistic acts.
700	As in the case of acts of compassion, these do not target personal utility.
700	Their aim is to cause damage to others, independently of personal gains.
700	Punishment  According to Schopenhauer, whenever we make a choice, "we assume as necessary that decision was preceded by something from which it ensued, and which we call the ground or reason, or more accurately the motive, of the resultant action."
700	Choices are not made freely.
700	Our actions are necessary and determined because "every human being, even every animal, after the motive has appeared, must carry out the action which alone is in accordance with his inborn and immutable character."
700	A definite action inevitably results when a particular motive influences a person's given, unchangeable character.
700	The State, Schopenhauer claimed, punishes criminals in order to prevent future crimes.
700	It does so by placing "beside every possible motive for committing a wrong a more powerful motive for leaving it undone, in the inescapable punishment.
700	Accordingly, the criminal code is as complete a register as possible of counter-motives to all criminal actions that can possibly be imagined...."
700	Should capital punishment be legal?
700	"For safeguarding the lives of citizens," he asserted, "capital punishment is therefore absolutely necessary."
700	"The murderer," wrote Schopenhauer, "who is condemned to death according to the law must, it is true, be now used as a mere means, and with complete right.
700	For public security, which is the principal object of the State, is disturbed by him; indeed it is abolished if the law remains unfulfilled.
700	The murderer, his life, his person, must be the means of fulfilling the law, and thus of re-establishing public security."
700	Schopenhauer disagreed with those who would abolish capital punishment.
700	"Those who would like to abolish it should be given the answer: 'First remove murder from the world, and then capital punishment ought to follow.'
700	" People, according to Schopenhauer, cannot be improved.
700	They can only be influenced by strong motives that overpower criminal motives.
700	Schopenhauer declared that "real moral reform is not at all possible, but only determent from the deed...."
700	He claimed that this doctrine was not original with him.
700	Previously, it appeared in the writings of Plato, Seneca, Hobbes, Pufendorf, and Anselm Feuerbach.
700	Schopenhauer declared that their teaching was corrupted by subsequent errors and therefore was in need of clarification.
700	Psychology  Philosophers have not traditionally been impressed by the tribulations of sex, but Schopenhauer addressed it and related concepts forthrightly: ...one ought rather to be surprised that a thing [sex] which plays throughout so important a part in human life has hitherto practically been disregarded by philosophers altogether, and lies before us as raw and untreated material.
700	He gave a name to a force within man which he felt had invariably precedence over reason: the Will to Live or Will to Life (Wille zum Leben), defined as an inherent drive within human beings, and indeed all creatures, to stay alive; a force which inveigles us into reproducing.
700	Schopenhauer refused to conceive of love as either trifling or accidental, but rather understood it to be an immensely powerful force lying unseen within man's psyche and dramatically shaping the world: The ultimate aim of all love affairs ...
700	What is decided by it is nothing less than the composition of the next generation ...
700	These ideas foreshadowed the discovery of evolution, Freud's concepts of the libido and the unconscious mind, and evolutionary psychology in general.
700	Political and social thought  Politics  Schopenhauer's politics were, for the most part, an echo of his system of ethics (the latter being exprhauer's poessed in Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik, available in English as two separate books, On the Basis of Morality and On the Freedom of the Will).
700	Ethics also occupies about one quarter of his central work, The World as Will and Representation.
700	In occasional political comments in his Parerga and Paralipomena and Manuscript Remains, Schopenhauer described himself as a proponent of limited government.
700	What was essential, he thought, was that the state should "leave each man free to work out his own salvation", and so long as government was thus limited, he would "prefer to be ruled by a lion than one of [his] fellow rats" — i.e., by a monarch, rather than a democrat.
700	Schopenhauer shared the view of Thomas Hobbes on the necessity of the state, and of state action, to check the destructive tendencies innate to our species.
700	He also defended the independence of the legislative, judicial and executive branches of power, and a monarch as an impartial element able to practice justice (in a practical and everyday sense, not a cosmological one).
700	He declared monarchy as "that which is natural to man" for "intelligence has always under a monarchical government a much better chance against its irreconcilable and ever-present foe, stupidity" and disparaged republicanism as "unnatural as it is unfavourable to the higher intellectual life and the arts and sciences."
700	Schopenhauer, by his own admission, did not give much thought to politics, and several times he writes proudly of how little attention he had paid "to political affairs of [his] day".
700	In a life that spanned several revolutions in French and German government, and a few continent-shaking wars, he did indeed maintain his aloof position of "minding not the times but the eternities".
700	He wrote many disparaging remarks about Germany and the Germans.
700	A typical example is, "For a German it is even good to have somewhat lengthy words in his mouth, for he thinks slowly, and they give him time to reflect."
700	Schopenhauer attributed civilizational primacy to the northern "white races" due to their sensitivity and creativity (except for the ancient Egyptians and Hindus whom he saw as equal): The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient Hindus and Egyptians, are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmans, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands.
700	All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate.
700	This they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilization.
700	Despite this, he was adamantly against differing treatment of races, was fervently anti-slavery, and supported the abolitionist movement in the United States.
700	He describes the treatment of "[our] innocent black brothers whom force and injustice have delivered into [the slave-master's] devilish clutches" as "belonging to the blackest pages of mankind's criminal record".
700	Schopenhauer additionally maintained a marked metaphysical and political anti-Judaism.
700	Schopenhauer argued that Christianity constituted a revolt against the materialistic basis of Judaism, exhibiting an Indian-influenced ethics reflecting the Aryan-Vedic theme of spiritual "self-conquest."
700	This he saw as opposed to what he held to be the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism and superficiality of a worldly Jewish spirit: While all other religions endeavor to explain to the people by symbols the metaphysical significance of life, the religion of the Jews is entirely immanent and furnishes nothing but a mere war-cry in the struggle with other nations.
700	Views on women  In Schopenhauer's 1851 essay Of Women, he expressed his opposition to what he called "Teutonico-Christian stupidity" on female affairs.
700	He claimed that "woman is by nature meant to obey", and opposed Schiller's poem in honor of women, "" ("Dignity of Women").
700	The essay does give two compliments, however: that "women are decidedly more sober in their judgment than [men] are" and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others.
700	Schopenhauer's controversial writings have influenced many, from Friedrich Nietzsche to nineteenth-century feminists.
700	Schopenhauer's biological analysis of the difference between the sexes, and their separate roles in the struggle for survival and reproduction, anticipates some of the claims that were later ventured by sociobiologists and evolutionary psychologists.
700	After the elderly Schopenhauer sat for a sculpture portrait by Elisabet Ney, he told Richard Wagner's friend Malwida von Meysenbug, "I have not yet spoken my last word about women.
700	I believe that if a woman succeeds in withdrawing from the mass, or rather raising herself above the mass, she grows ceaselessly and more than a man."
700	Heredity and eugenics  Schopenhauer believed that personality and intellect were inherited.
700	He quotes Horace's saying, "From the brave and good are the brave descended" (Odes, iv, 4, 29) and Shakespeare's line from Cymbeline, "Cowards father cowards, and base things sire base" (IV, 2) to reinforce his hereditarian argument.
700	Mechanistically, Schopenhauer believed that a person inherits his level of intellect through his mother, and personal character through one's father.
700	This belief in heritability of traits informed Schopenhauer's view of love –  placing it at the highest level of importance.
700	For Schopenhauer the “final aim of all love intrigues, be they comic or tragic, is really of more importance than all other ends in human life.
700	What it all turns upon is nothing less than the composition of the next generation....
700	It is not the weal or woe of any one individual, but that of the human race to come, which is here at stake.” This view of the importance for the species of whom we choose to love was reflected in his views on eugenics or good breeding.
700	Here Schopenhauer wrote: With our knowledge of the complete unalterability both of character and of mental faculties, we are led to the view that a real and thorough imbility both of chprovement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within, not so much by theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation.
700	Plato had something of the kind in mind when, in the fifth book of his Republic, he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste.
700	If we could castrate all scoundrels and stick all stupid geese in a convent, and give men of noble character a whole harem, and procure men, and indeed thorough men, for all girls of intellect and understanding, then a generation would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of Pericles.
700	In another context, Schopenhauer reiterated his antidemocratic-eugenic thesis: "If you want Utopian plans, I would say: the only solution to the problem is the despotism of the wise and noble members of a genuine aristocracy, a genuine nobility, achieved by mating the most magnanimous men with the cleverest and most gifted women.
700	This proposal constitutes my Utopia and my Platonic Republic".
700	Analysts (e.g., Keith Ansell-Pearson) have suggested that Schopenhauer's advocacy of anti-egalitarianism and eugenics influenced the neo-aristocratic philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, who initially considered Schopenhauer his mentor.
700	Animal welfare  As a consequence of his monistic philosophy, Schopenhauer was very concerned about the welfare of animals.
700	For him, all individual animals, including humans, are essentially the same, being phenomenal manifestations of the one underlying Will.
700	The word "will" designated, for him, force, power, impulse, energy, and desire; it is the closest word we have that can signify both the real essence of all external things and also our own direct, inner experience.
700	Since everything is basically Will, then humans and animals are fundamentally the same and can recognize themselves in each other.
700	For this reason, he claimed that a good person would have sympathy for animals, who are our fellow sufferers.
700	Compassion for animals is intimately associated with goodness of character, and it may be confidently asserted that he who is cruel to living creatures cannot be a good man.
700	Nothing leads more definitely to a recognition of the identity of the essential nature in animal and human phenomena than a study of zoology and anatomy.
700	The assumption that animals are without rights and the illusion that our treatment of them has no moral significance is a positively outrageous example of Western crudity and barbarity.
700	Universal compassion is the only guarantee of morality.
700	In 1841, he praised the establishment, in London, of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and also the Animals' Friends Society in Philadelphia.
700	Schopenhauer even went so far as to protest against the use of the pronoun "it" in reference to animals because it led to the treatment of them as though they were inanimate things.
700	To reinforce his points, Schopenhauer referred to anecdotal reports of the look in the eyes of a monkey who had been shot and also the grief of a baby elephant whose mother had been killed by a hunter.
700	He was very attached to his succession of pet poodles.
700	Schopenhauer criticized Spinoza's belief that animals are to be used as a mere means for the satisfaction of humans.
700	Views on homosexuality and pederasty  Schopenhauer was also one of the first philosophers since the days of Greek philosophy to address the subject of male homosexuality.
700	In the third, expanded edition of The World as Will and Representation (1856), Schopenhauer added an appendix to his chapter on the "Metaphysics of Sexual Love".
700	He also wrote that homosexuality did have the benefit of preventing ill-begotten children.
700	Concerning this, he stated, "...
700	" Shrewdly anticipating the interpretive distortion, on the part of the popular mind, of his attempted scientific explanation of pederasty as personal advocacy (when he had otherwise described the act, in terms of spiritual ethics, as an "objectionable aberration"), Schopenhauer sarcastically concludes the appendix with the statement that "by expounding these paradoxical ideas, I wanted to grant to the professors of philosophy a small favour, for they are very disconcerted by the ever-increasing publicization of my philosophy which they so carefully concealed.
700	I have done so by giving them the opportunity of slandering me by saying that I defend and commend pederasty."
700	Intellectual interests and affinities  Indology  Schopenhauer read the Latin translation of the Upanishads which had been translated by French writer Anquetil du Perron from the Persian translation of Prince Dara Shikoh entitled Sirre-Akbar ("The Great Secret").
700	He was so impressed by their philosophy that he called them "the production of the highest human wisdom," and considered them to contain superhuman conceptions.
700	The Upanishads was a great source of inspiration to Schopenhauer, and writing about them he said: It is the most satisfying and elevating reading (with the exception of the original text) which is possible in the world; it has been the solace of my life and will be the solace of my death.
700	It is well known that the book Oupnekhat (Upanishad) always lay open on his table, and he invariably studied it before sleeping at night.
700	He called the opening up of Sanskrit literature "the greatest gift of our century", and predicted that the philosophy and knowledge of the Upanishads would become the cherished faith of the West.
700	Schopenhauer was first introduced to the 1802 Latin Upanishad translation through Friedrich Majer.
700	They met during the winter of 1813-1814 in Weimar at the home of Schopenhauer’s mother according to the biographer Sanfranski.
700	Majer was a follower of Herder, and an early Indologist.
700	Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of the Indic texts, however, until the summer of 1814.
700	Sansfranski maintains that between 1815 and 1817, Schopenhauer had another important cross-pollination with Indian Thought in Dresden.
700	This was through his neighbor of two years, Karl Christian Friedrich Krause.
700	Krause was then a minor and rather unorthodox philosopher who attempted to mix his own ideas with that of ancient Indian wisdom.
700	Krause had also mastered Sanskrit, unlike Schopenhauer, and the two developed a professional relationship.
700	It was from Krause that Schopenhauer learned meditation and received the closest thing to expert advice concerning Indian thought.
700	Most noticeable, in the case of Schopenhauer’s work, was the significance of the Chandogya Upanishad, whose Mahavakya, Tat Tvam Asi is mentioned throughout The World as Will and Representation.
700	Buddhism  Schopenhauer noted a correspondence between his doctrines and the Four Noble Truths of Buddhism.
700	Similarities centered on the principles that life involves suffering, that suffering is caused by desire (tanha), and that the extinction of desire leads to liberation.
700	Thus three of the four "truths of the Buddha" correspond to Schopenhauer's doctrine of the will.
700	In Buddhism, however, while greed and lust are always unskillful, desire is ethically variable - it can be skillful, unskillful, or neutral.
700	For Schopenhauer, Will had ontological primacy over the intellect; in other words, desire is understood to be prior to thought.
700	Schopenhauer felt this was similar to notions of purushartha or goals of life in Vedanta Hinduism.
700	In Schopenhauer's philosophy, denial of the will is attained by either: * personal experience of an extremely great suffering that leads to loss of the will to live; or * knowledge of the essential nature of life in the world through observation of the suffering of other people.
700	However, Buddhist nirvana is not equivalent to the condition that Schopenhauer described as denial of the will.
700	Nirvana is not the extinguishing of the person as some Western scholars have thought, but only the "extinguishing" (the literal meaning of nirvana) of the flames of greed, hatred, and delusion that assail a person's character.
700	Occult historian Joscelyn Godwin (1945- ) stated, "It was Buddhism that inspired the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, and, through him, attracted Richard Wagner.
700	This Orientalism reflected the struggle of the German Romantics, in the words of Leon Poliakov, to free themselves from Judeo-Christian fetters".
700	In contradistinction to Godwin's claim that Buddhism inspired Schopenhauer, the philosopher himself made the following statement in his discussion of religions: If I wished to take the results of my philosophy as the standard of truth, I should have to concede to Buddhism pre-eminence over the others.
700	In any case, it must be a pleasure to me to see my doctrine in such close agreement with a religion that the majority of men on earth hold as their own, for this numbers far more followers than any other.
700	And this agreement must be yet the more pleasing to me, inasmuch as in my philosophizing I have certainly not been under its influence [emphasis added].
700	For up till 1818, when my work appeared, there was to be found in Europe only a very few accounts of Buddhism.
700	Buddhist philosopher Nishitani Keiji, however, sought to distance Buddhism from Schopenhauer.
700	While Schopenhauer's philosophy may sound rather mystical in such a summary, his methodology was resolutely empirical, rather than speculative or transcendental: Philosophy ...
700	Also note: This actual world of what is knowable, in which we are and which is in us, remains both the material and the limit of our consideration.
700	The argument that Buddhism affected Schopenhauer’s philosophy more than any other Dharmic faith loses more credence when viewed in light of the fact that Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of Buddhism until after the publication of The World as Will and Representation in 1818.
700	Scholars have started to revise earlier views about Schopenhauer's discovery of Buddhism.
700	Proof of early interest and influence appears in Schopenhauer's 1815/16 notes (transcribed and translated by Urs App)  about Buddhism.
700	They are included in a recent case study that traces Schopenhauer's interest in Buddhism and documents its influence.
700	Influences  Schopenhauer said he was influenced by the Upanishads, Immanuel Kant and Plato.
700	References to Eastern philosophy and religion appear frequently in Schopenhauer's writing.
700	As noted above, he appreciated the teachings of the Buddha and even called himself a "Buddhist".
700	He said  that his philosophy could not have been conceived before these teachings were available.
700	Concerning the Upanishads and Vedas, he writes in The World as Will and Representation: If the reader has also received the benefit of the Vedas, the access to which by means of the Upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century (1818) may claim before all previous centuries, if then the reader, I say, has received his initiation in primeval Indian wisdom, and received it with an open heart, he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what I have to tell him.
700	It will not sound to him strange, as to many others, much less disagreeable; for I might, if it did not sound conceited, contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the Upanishads, may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which I have to enunciate, though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there.
700	He summarised the influence of the Upanishads thus: "It has been the solace of my life, it will be the solace of my death!"
700	Among Schopenhauer's other influences were: Shakespeare, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, John Locke, Baruch Spinoza, Matthias Claudius, George Berkeley, David Hume, and René Descartes.
700	Critique of Kant and Hegel  Critique of the Kantian philosophy  Schopenhauer accepted Kant's double-aspect of the universe — the phenomenal (world of experience) and the noumenal (the true world, independent of experience).
700	Some commentators suggest that Schopenhauer claimed that the noumenon, or thing-in-itself, was the basis for Schopenhauer's concept of the will.
700	Other commentators suggest that Schopenhauer considered will to be only a subset of the "thing-in-itself" class, namely that which we can most directly experience.
700	Schopenhauer's identification of the Kantian noumenon (i.e., the actually existing entity) with what he termed "will" deserves some explanation.
700	The noumenon was what Kant called the Ding an Sich (the Thing in Itself), the reality that is the foundation of our sensory and mental representations of an external world.
700	In Kantian terms, those sensory and mental representations are mere phenomena.
700	Schopenhauer departed from Kant in his description of the relationship between the phenomenon and the noumenon.
700	According to Kant, things-in-themselves ground the phenomenal representations in our minds; Schopenhauer, on the other hand, believed phenomena and noumena to be two different sides of the same coin.
700	Noumena do not cause phenomena, but rather phenomena are simply the way by which our minds perceive the noumena, according to the Principle of Sufficient Reason.
700	This is explained more fully in Schopenhauer's doctoral thesis, On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason.
700	Schopenhauer's second major departure from Kant's epistemology concerns the body.
700	Kant's philosophy was formulated as a response to the radical philosophical skepticism of David Hume, who claimed that causality could not be oto the radical human bodies have boundaries and occupy space, the same way other objects known only through our named senses do.
700	Though we seldom think of our body as a physical object, we know even before reflection that it shares some of an object's properties.
700	We understand that a watermelon cannot successfully occupy the same space as an oncoming truck; we know that if we tried to repeat the experiment with our own body, we would obtain similar results – we know this even if we do not understand the physics involved.
700	We know that our consciousness inhabits a physical body, similar to other physical objects only known as phenomena.
700	Yet our consciousness is not commensurate with our body.
700	Most of us possess the power of voluntary motion.
700	We usually are not aware of the breathing of our lungs or the beating of our heart unless somehow our attention is called to them.
700	Our ability to control either is limited.
700	Our kidneys command our attention on their schedule rather than one we choose.
700	Few of us have any idea what our liver is doing right now, though this organ is as needful as lungs, heart, or kidneys.
700	The conscious mind is the servant, not the master, of these and other organs; these organs have an agenda which the conscious mind did not choose, and over which it has limited power.
700	When Schopenhauer identifies the noumenon with the desires, needs, and impulses in us that we name "will," what he is saying is that we participate in the reality of an otherwise unachievable world outside the mind through will.
700	We cannot prove that our mental picture of an outside world corresponds with a reality by reasoning; through will, we know – without thinking – that the world can stimulate us.
700	We suffer fear, or desire: these states arise involuntarily; they arise prior to reflection; they arise even when the conscious mind would prefer to hold them at bay.
700	The rational mind is, for Schopenhauer, a leaf borne along in a stream of pre-reflective and largely unconscious emotion.
700	That stream is will, and through will, if not through logic, we can participate in the underlying reality beyond mere phenomena.
700	It is for this reason that Schopenhauer identifies the noumenon with what we call our will.
700	In his criticism of Kant, Schopenhauer claimed that sensation and understanding are separate and distinct abilities.
700	Yet, for Kant, an object is known through each of them.
700	Kant wrote: "...
700	T]here are two stems of human knowledge ...
700	" Schopenhauer disagreed.
700	He asserted that mere sense impressions, not objects, are given by sensibility.
700	According to Schopenhauer, objects are intuitively perceived by understanding and are discursively thought by reason (Kant had claimed that (1) the understanding thinks objects through concepts and that (2) reason seeks the unconditioned or ultimate answer to "why?").
700	Schopenhauer said that Kant's mistake regarding perception resulted in all of the obscurity and difficult confusion that is exhibited in the Transcendental Analytic section of his critique.
700	Lastly, Schopenhauer departed from Kant in how he interpreted the Platonic ideas.
700	In The World as Will and Representation Schopenhauer explicitly stated: ...Kant used the word [Idea] wrongly  as well as illegitimately, although Plato had already taken possession of it, and used it most appropriately.
700	Instead Schopenhauer relied upon the Neoplatonist interpretation of the biographer Diogenes Laërtius from Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers.
700	In reference to Plato’s Ideas, Schopenhauer quotes Laërtius verbatim in an explanatory footnote.
700	Diogenes Laërtius (III, 12) Plato ideas in natura velut exemplaria dixit subsistere; cetera his esse similia, ad istarum similitudinem consistencia.
700	Plato teaches that the Ideas exist in nature, so to speak, as patterns or prototypes, and that the remainder of things only resemble them, and exist as their copies.) Critique of Hegel  Schopenhauer expressed his dislike for the philosophy of his contemporary Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel many times in his published works.
700	The following quotations are typical: If I were to say that the so-called philosophy of this fellow Hegel is a colossal piece of mystification which will yet provide posterity with an inexhaustible theme for laughter at our times, that it is a pseudo-philosophy paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking, and, by the most outrageous misuse of language, putting in its place the hollowest, most senseless, thoughtless, and, as is confirmed by its success, most stupefying verbiage, I should be quite right.
700	Further, if I were to say that this summus philosophus [...] scribbled nonsense quite unlike any mortal before him, so that whoever could read his most eulogized work, the so-called Phenomenology of the Mind, without feeling as if he were in a madhouse, would qualify as an inmate for Bedlam, I should be no less right.
700	At first Fichte and Schelling shine as the heroes of this epoch; to be followed by the man who is quite unworthy even of them, and greatly their inferior in point of talent --- I mean the stupid and clumsy charlatan Hegel.
700	In his Foreword to the first edition of his work Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik, Schopenhauer suggested that he had shown Hegel to have fallen prey to the Post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy.
700	Schopenhauer suggested that Hegel's works were filled with "castles of abstraction," and that Hegel used deliberately impressive but ultimately vacuous verbiage.
700	He also thought that his glorification of church and state were designed for personal advantage and had little to do with the search for philosophical truth.
700	For instance, the Right Hegelians interpreted Hegel as viewing the Prussian state of his day as perfect and the goal of all history up until then.
700	Criticism  The British philosopher and historian Bertrand Russell, deemed Schopenhauer's doctrine insincere, because judging by his life: 'He habitually dined well, at a good restaurant; he had many trivial love-affairs, which were sensual but not passionate; he was exceedingly quarrelsome and unusually avaricious.
700	It is hard to find in his life evidences of any virtue except kindness to animals ...
700	In all other respects he was completely selfish.
700	It is difficult to believe that a man who was profoundly convinced of the virtue of asceticism and resignation would never have made any attempt to embody his convictions in his practice.'
700	Influence  Schopenhauer has had a massive influence upon later thinkers, though more so in the arts (especially literature and music) and psychology than in philosophy.
700	His popularity peaked in the early twentieth century, especially during the Modernist era, and waned somewhat thereafter.
700	Nevertheless, a number of recent publications have reinterpreted and modernised the study of Schopenhauer.
700	His theory is also being explored by some modern philosophers as a precursor to evolutionary theory and modern evolutionary psychology.
700	Richard Wagner, writing in his autobiography, remembered his first impression that Schopenhauer left on him (when he read World as will and representation): Schopenhauer’s book was never completely out of my mind, and by the following summer I had studied it from cover to cover four times.
700	It had a radical influence on my whole life.
700	Wagner also commented that "serious mood, which was trying to find ecstatic expression" created by Schopenhauer inspired the conception of Tristan und Isolde.
700	See also Influence of Schopenhauer on Tristan und Isolde.
700	Friedrich Nietzsche owed the awakening of his philosophical interest to reading The World as Will and Representation and admitted that he was one of the few philosophers that he respected, dedicating to him his essay Schopenhauer als Erzieher one of his Untimely Meditations.
700	Jorge Luis Borges remarked that the reason he had never attempted to write a systematic account of his world view, despite his penchant for philosophy and metaphysics in particular, was because Schopenhauer had already written it for him.
700	As a teenager, Ludwig Wittgenstein was strongly influenced by Schopenhauer's epistemological idealism.
700	However, after his study of the philosophy of mathematics, he abandoned epistemological idealism for Gottlob Frege's conceptual realism.
700	The philosopher Gilbert Ryle read Schopenhauer's works as a student, but later largely forgot them.
700	He unwittingly recycled ideas from Schopenhauer in his The Concept of Mind.

701	The exclave province of Cabinda has borders with the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
701	The Portuguese were present in some—mostly coastal—points of the territory of what is now Angola, from the 16th to the 19th century, interacting in diverse ways with the peoples that lived there.
701	In the 19th century they slowly and hesitantly began to establish themselves in the interior.
701	Angola as a Portuguese colony encompassing the present territory was not established before the end of the 19th century, and "effective occupation", as required by the Berlin Conference (1884) was achieved only by the 1920s.
701	Independence was achieved in 1975, after a protracted liberation war.
701	After independence, Angola was the scene of an intense civil war from 1975 to 2002.
701	The country has vast mineral and petroleum reserves, and its economy has on average grown at a two-digit pace since the 1990s, especially since the end of the civil war.
701	In spite of this, standards of living remain low for the majority of the population, and life expectancy and infant mortality rates in Angola are among the worst-ranked in the world.
701	Angola is considered to be economically disparate, with the majority of the nation's wealth concentrated in a disproportionately small sector of the population.
701	Angola is a member state of the African Union, the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, the Latin Union and the Southern African Development Community.
701	Etymology The name Angola comes from the Portuguese colonial name Reino de Angola (Kingdom of Angola), appearing as early as Dias de Novais's 1571 charter.
701	The toponym was derived by the Portuguese from the title ngola held by the kings of Ndongo.
701	Ndongo was a kingdom in the highlands, between the Kwanza and Lukala Rivers, nominally tributary to the king of Kongo but which was seeking greater independence during the 16th century.
701	History  Early migrations and political units  Khoisan hunter-gatherers are the earliest known modern human inhabitants of the area.
701	They were largely absorbed and/or replaced by Bantu peoples during the Bantu migrations, though small numbers remain in parts of southern Angola to the present day.
701	The Bantu came from the north, probably from somewhere near the present-day Republic of Cameroon.
701	When they reached what is now Angola, they encountered the Khoisan, Bushmen and other groups considerably less technologically advanced than themselves, whom they easily domin and other groups considerably less tecated with their superior knowledge of metal-working, ceramics and agriculture.
701	The establishment of the Bantu took many centuries and gave rise to various groups who took on different ethnic characteristics.
701	During this period of time, the Bantu established a number of political units ("kingdoms", "empires") in most parts of what today is Angola.
701	The best known of these is the Kingdom of the Kongo that had its centre in the northwest of contemporary Angola, but included important regions in the west of present day Democratic Republic of the Congo and Republic of Congo as well as in southern Gabon.
701	It established trade routes with other trading cities and civilizations up and down the coast of southwestern and West Africa and even with the Great Zimbabwe Mutapa Empire, but engaged in little or no transoceanic trade.
701	Portuguese presence on the coast  The geographical areas now designated as Angola entered into contact with the Portuguese in the late 15th century, concretely in 1483, when Portugal established relations with the Kongo State, which stretched from modern Gabon in the north to the Kwanza River in the south.
701	In this context, they established a small trade post at the port of Mpinda, in Soyo.
701	The Portuguese explorer Paulo Dias de Novais founded Luanda in 1575 as "São Paulo de Loanda", with a hundred families of settlers and four hundred soldiers.
701	Benguela, a Portuguese fort from 1587 which became a town in 1617, was another important early settlement they founded and ruled.
701	The Portuguese would establish several settlements, forts and trading posts along the coastal strip of current-day Angola, which relied on slave trade, commerce in raw materials, and exchange of goods for survival.
701	The African slave trade provided a large number of black slaves to Europeans and their African agents.
701	For example, in what is now Angola, the Imbangala economy was heavily focused on the slave trade.
701	European traders would export manufactured goods to the coast of Africa where they would be exchanged for slaves.
701	Within the Portuguese Empire, most black African slaves were traded to Portuguese merchants who bought them to sell as cheap labour for use on Brazilian agricultural plantations.
701	This trade would last until the first half of the 19th century.
701	According to John Iliffe, "Portuguese records of Angola from the 16th century show that a great famine occurred on average every seventy years; accompanied by epidemic disease, it might kill one-third or one-half of the population, destroying the demographic growth of a generation and forcing colonists back into the river valleys".
701	The Portuguese gradually took control of the coastal strip during the 16th century by a series of treaties and wars, forming the Portuguese colony of Angola.
701	Taking advantage of the Portuguese Restoration War, the Dutch occupied Luanda from 1641 to 1648, where they allied with local peoples, consolidating their colonial rule against the remaining Portuguese resistance.
701	In 1648, a fleet under the command of Salvador de Sá retook Luanda for Portugal and initiated a conquest of the lost territories, which restored Portugal to its former possessions by 1650.
701	Treaties regulated relations with Kongo in 1649 and Njinga's Kingdom of Matamba and Ndongo in 1656.
701	The conquest of Pungo Andongo in 1671 was the last major Portuguese expansion from Luanda outwards, as attempts to invade Kongo in 1670 and Matamba in 1681 failed.
701	Portugal also expanded its territory behind the colony of Benguela to some extent, but until the 19th century the inroads from Luanda and Benguela were very limited, and Portugal had neither the intention nor the means to carry out a large scale territorial occupation and colonization.
701	Delimitation and occupation of Angola  The process resulted in few gains until the 1880s.
701	Development of the hinterland began after the Berlin Conference in 1885 fixed the colony's borders, and British and Portuguese investment fostered mining, railways, and agriculture based on various forced labour systems.
701	Full Portuguese administrative control of the hinterland did not occur until the beginning of the 20th century.
701	In 1951, the colony was designated as an overseas province, called Overseas Province of Angola.
701	Portugal had a presence in Angola for nearly five hundred years, and the population's initial reaction to calls for independence was scarce.
701	More overtly political organisations first appeared in the 1950s and began to make organised demands for self-determination, especially in international forums such as the Non-Aligned Movement.
701	The Portuguese regime, meanwhile, refused to accede to the demands for independence, provoking an armed conflict that started in 1961 when black guerrillas attacked both white and black civilians in cross-border operations in northeastern Angola.
701	The war came to be known as the Colonial War.
701	In this struggle, the principal protagonists were the MPLA (Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola), founded in 1956, the FNLA (National Front for the Liberation of Angola), which appeared in 1961, and UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola), founded in 1966.
701	After many years of conflict that lead to the weakening of all the insurgent parties, Angola gained its independence on 11 November 1975, after the 1974 coup d'état in Lisbon, Portugal, which overthrew the Portuguese regime headed by Marcelo Caetano.
701	Portugal's new revolutionary leaders began in 1974 a process of political change at home and accepted its former colonies' independence abroad.
701	In Angola, a fight for the conquest of power broke out immediately between the three nationalist movements.
701	The events prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens, creating up to 300 000 destitute Portuguese refugees—the retornados.
701	The new Portuguese government tried to mediate an understanding between the three competing movements, and succeeded in agreeing, on paper, to form a common government, but in the end none of them respected the commitments made, and the issue was resolved by military force.
701	Independence and civil war  After independence in November 1975, Angola faced a devastating civil war which lasted several decades and claimed millions of lives and produced many refugees.
701	Following negotiations held in Portugal, itself under severe social and political turmoil and uncertainty due to the April 1974 revolution, Angola's three main guerrilla groups agreed to establish a transitional government in January 1975.
701	Within two months, however, the FNLA, MPLA and UNITA were fighting each other and the country was well on its way to being divided into zones controlled by rival armed political groups.
701	The superpowers were quickly drawn into the conflict, which became a flash point for the Cold War.
701	The United States, Zaire (today's DRC) and South Africa supported the FNLA and UNITA.
701	The Soviet Union and Cuba supported the MPLA.
701	In the beginning of the Civil War, most of the half million Portuguese that lived in Angola and accounted for the majority of the skilled work in the public administration, agriculture, industries and trade fled the country leaving its once prosperous and growing economy to a state of bankruptcy.
701	During most of this period, 1975–1990, the MPLA organised and maintained a socialist regime.
701	Ceasefire with UNITA  On 22 March 2002, Jonas Savimbi, the leader of UNITA, was killed in combat with government troops.
701	A cease-fire was reached by the two factions shortly afterwards.
701	UNITA gave up its armed wing and assumed the role of major opposition party, although in the knowledge that in the present regime a legitimate democratic election is impossible.
701	Although the political situation of the country began to stabilize, President Dos Santos has so far refused to institute regular democratic processes, UNITA head officials being given senior positions in top level companies.
701	Among Angola's major problems are a serious humanitarian crisis (a result of the prolonged war), the abundance of minefields, the continuation of the political, and to a much lesser degree, military activities in favour of the independence of the northern exclave of Cabinda, carried out in the context of the protracted Cabinda Conflict by the Frente para a Libertação do Enclave de Cabinda, but most of all, the dilapidation of the country's rich mineral resources by the regime.
701	While most of the internally displaced have now settled around the capital, in the so-called "Musseques", the general situation for Angolans remains desperate.
701	Politics  Angola's motto is Virtus Unita Fortior, a Latin phrase meaning "Virtue is stronger when united".
701	The executive branch of the government is composed of the President, the Vice-Presidents and the Council of Ministers.
701	For decades, political power has been concentrated in the Presidency.
701	Governors of the 18 provinces are appointed by the president.
701	The Constitutional Law of 1992 establishes the broad outlines of government structure and delineates the rights and duties of citizens.
701	The legal system is based on Portuguese and customary law but is weak and fragmented, and courts operate in only 12 of more than 140 municipalities.
701	A Supreme Court serves as the appellate tribunal; a Constitutional Court with powers of judicial review has not been constituted until 2010, despite statutory authorization.
701	After the end of the Civil War the regime came under pressure from within as well as from the international environment, to become more democratic and less authoritarian.
701	Its reaction was to operate a number of changes without substantially changing its character.
701	Parliamentary elections held on 5 September 2008, announced MPLA as the winning party with 81% of votes.
701	The closest opposition party was UNITA with 10%.
701	These elections were the first since 1992 and were described as only partly free but certainly not as fair.
701	A White Book on the elections in 2008 lists all irregularities surrounding the Parliamentary elections of 2008.
701	Angola scored poorly on the 2008 Ibrahim Index of African Governance.
701	It was ranked 44 from 48 sub-Saharan African countries, scoring particularly badly in the areas of Participation and Human Rights, Sustainable Economic Opportunity and Human Development.
701	The Ibrahim Index uses a number of different variables to compile its list which reflects the state of governance in Africa.
701	The new constitution, adopted in 2010, further sharpened the authoritarian character of the regime.
701	In the future, there will be no presidential elections: the president and the vice-president of the political party which comes out strongest in the parliamentary elections become automatically president and vice-president of Angola.
701	Through a variety of mechanisms, the state president controls all the other organs of the state, so that the principle of the division of power is not maintained.
701	As a consequence, Angola has no longer a presidential system, in the sense of the systems existing e.g.
701	USA or in France.
701	In terms of the classifications used in constitutional law, its regime falls now in the same category as the "caesarist" monarchy of Napoléon Bonaparte in France, António de Oliveira Salazar's "corporatist" system established by the Portuguese constitution of 1933, the Brazilian military dictatorship based on the constitution of 1967/69, or several authoritarian regimes in contemporary Africa.
701	Military  The Angolan Armed Forces (AAF) is headed by a Chief of Staff who reports to the Minister of Defense.
701	There are three divisions—the Army (Exército), Navy (Marinha de Guerra, MGA), and National Air Force (Força Aérea Nacional, FAN).
701	Total manpower is about 110,000.
701	Its equipment includes Russian-manufactured fighters, bombers, and transport planes.
701	There are also Brazilian-made EMB-312 Tucano for training role, Czech-made L-39 for training and bombing role, Czech Zlin for training role and a variety of western made aircraft such as C-212\Aviocar, Sud Aviation Alouette III, etc.
701	A small number of AAF personnel are stationed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Kinshasa) and the Republic of the Congo (Brazzaville).
701	Police  The National Police departments are: Public Order, Criminal Investigation, Traffic and Transport, Investigation and Inspection of Economic Activities, Taxation and Frontier Supervision, Riot Police and the Rapid Intervention Police.
701	The National Police are in the process of standing up an air wing, which will provide helicopter support for police operations.
701	The National Police are also developing their criminal investigation and forensic capabilities.
701	The National Police has an estimated 6,000 patrol officers, 2,500 Taxation and Frontier Supervision officers, 182 criminal investigators and 100 financial crimes detectives and around 90 Economic Activity Inspectors.
701	The National Police have implemented a modernization and development plan to increase the capabilities and efficiency of the total force.
701	In addition to administrative reorganization; modernization projects include procurement of new vehicles, aircraft and equipment, construction of new police stations and forensic laboratories, restructured training programs and the replacement of AKM rifles with 9 mm UZIs for police officers in urban areas.
701	Administrative divisions  Angola is divided into eighteen provinces (províncias) and 163 municipalities.
701	The provinces are: #Bengo #Benguela #Bié #Cabinda #Cuando Cubango #Cuanza Norte #Cuanza Sul #Cunene #Huambo #Huila #Luanda #Lunda Norte #Lunda Sul #Malanje #Moxico #Namibe #Uíge #Zaire Exclave of Cabinda  With an area of approximately 7283 km2, the Northern Angolan province of Cabinda is unique in being separated from the rest of the country by a strip, some 60 km wide, of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) along the lower Congo river.
701	Cabinda borders the Congo Republic to the north and north-northeast and the DRC to the east and south.
701	The town of Cabinda is the chief population center.
701	According to a 1995 census, Cabinda had an estimated population of 600,000, approximately 400,000 of whom live in neighboring countries.
701	Population estimates are, however, highly unreliable.
701	Consisting largely of tropical forest, Cabinda produces hardwoods, coffee, cocoa, crude rubber and palm oil.
701	The product for which it is best known, however, is its oil, which has given it the nickname, "the Kuwait of Africa".
701	Cabinda's petroleum production from its considerable offshore reserves now accounts for more than half of Angola's output.
701	Most of the oil along its coast was discovered under Portuguese rule by the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company (CABGOC) from 1968 onwards.
701	Ever since Portugal handed over sovereignty of its former overseas province of Angola to the local independence groups (MPLA, UNITA, and FNLA), the territory of Cabinda has been a focus of separatist guerrilla actions opposing the Government of Angola (which has employed its military forces, the FAA—Forças Armadas Angolanas) and Cabindan separatists.
701	The Cabindan separatists, FLEC-FAC, announced a virtual Federal Republic of Cabinda under the Presidency of N'Zita Henriques Tiago.
701	One of the characteristics of the Cabindan independence movement is its constant fragmentation, into smaller and smaller factions.
701	Transport  Transport in Angola consists of: * Three separate railway systems totalling 2,761 km (1,715 mi) * 76626 km of highway of which 19156 km is paved * 1,295 navigable inland waterways * Eight major sea ports * 243 airports, of which 32 are paved.
701	Travel on highways outside of towns and cities in Angola (and in some cases within) is often not best advised for those without four-by-four vehicles.
701	While a reasonable road infrastructure has existed within Angola, time and the war have taken their toll on the road surfaces, leaving many severely potholed, littered with broken asphalt.
701	In many areas drivers have established alternate tracks to avoid the worst parts of the surface, although careful attention must be paid to the presence or absence of landmine warning markers by the side of the road.
701	The Angolan government has contracted the restoration of many of the country's roads.
701	The road between Lubango and Namibe, for example, was completed recently with funding from the European Union, and is comparable to many European main routes.
701	Progress to complete the road infrastructure is likely to take some decades, but substantial efforts are already being made in the right directions.
701	Geography  At 481321 sqmi, Angola is the world's twenty-third largest country (after Niger).
701	It is comparable in size to Mali and is nearly twice the size of the US state of Texas, or five times the area of the United Kingdom.
701	It lies mostly between latitudes 4° and 18°S, and longitudes 12° and 24°E.
701	Angola is bordered by Namibia to the south, Zambia to the east, the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north-east, and the South Atlantic Ocean to the west.
701	The exclave of Cabinda also borders the Republic of the Congo to the north.
701	Angola's capital, Luanda, lies on the Atlantic coast in the northwest of the country.
701	Climate  Angola's average temperature on the coast is 60 F in the winter and 70 F in the summer.
701	It has two seasons; dry season (May to October) and hot rainy season (November to April).
701	Economy  Angola has a rich subsoil heritage, from diamonds, oil, gold, copper, as well as a rich wildlife (dramatically impoverished during the civil war), forest, and fossils.
701	Since independence, oil and diamonds have been the most important economic resource.
701	Smallholder and plantation agriculture have dramatically dropped because of the Angolan Civil War, but have begun to recover after 2002.
701	The transformation industry that had come into existence in the late colonial period collapsed at independence, because of the exodus of most of the ethnic Portuguese population, but has begun to reemerge (with updated technologies), partly because of the influx of new Portuguese entrepreneurs.
701	Similar developments can be verified in the service sector.
701	Overall, Angola's economy has undergone a period of transformation in recent years, moving from the disarray caused by a quarter century of civil war to being the fastest growing economy in Africa and one of the fastest in the world, with an average GDP growth of 20 percent between 2005 and 2007.
701	In the period 2001–2010, Angola had the world's highest annual average GDP growth, at 11.1 percent.
701	In 2004, China's Eximbank approved a $2 billion line of credit to Angola.
701	The loan is being used to rebuild Angola's infrastructure, and has also limited the influence of the International Monetary Fund in the country.
701	China is Angola's biggest trade partner and export destination as well as the fourth-largest importer.
701	Bilateral trade reached $27.67 billion in 2011, up 11.5 percent year-on-year.
701	China’s imports, mainly crude oil and diamonds, increased 9.1 percent to $24.89 billion while China’s exports, including mechanical and electrical products, machinery parts and construction materials, surged 38.8 percent.
701	The Economist reported in 2008 that diamonds and oil make up 60 percent of Angola's economy, almost all of the country's revenue and are its dominant exports.
701	Growth is almost entirely driven by rising oil production which surpassed  in late 2005 and was expected to grow to 2 Moilbbl/d by 2007.
701	Control of the oil industry is consolidated in Sonangol Group, a conglomerate which is owned by the Angolan government.
701	In December 2006, Angola was admitted as a member of OPEC.
701	The economy grew 18% in 2005, 26% in 2006 and 17.6% in 2007.
701	However, due to the global recession the economy contracted an estimated −0.3% in 2009.
701	The security brought about by the 2002 peace settlement has led to the resettlement of 4 million displaced persons, thus resulting in large-scale increases in agriculture production.
701	Although the country's economy has developed very significantly since achieving political stability in 2002, mainly thanks to the fast-rising earnings of the oil sector, Angola faces huge social and economic problems.
701	These are in part a result of the almost continual state of conflict from 1961 onwards, although the highest level of destruction and socio-economic damage took place after the 1975 independence, during the long years of civil war.
701	However, high poverty rates and blatant social inequality are chiefly the outcome of a combination of a persistent political authoritarianism, of "neo-patrimonial" practices at all levels of the political, administrative, military, and economic apparatuses, and of a pervasive corruption.
701	The main beneficiary of this situation is a social segment constituted since 1975, but mainly during the last decades, around the political, administrative, economic, and military power holders, which has accumulated (and continues accumulating) enormous wealth.
701	"Secondary beneficiaries" are the middle strata which are about to become social classes.
701	However, overall almost half the population has to be considered as poor, but in this respect there are dramatic differences between the countryside and the cities (where by now slightly more than 50% of the people live).
701	An inquiry carried out in 2008 by the Angolan Instituto Nacional de Estatística has it that in the rural areas roughly 58% must be classified as "poor", according to UN norms, but in the urban areas only 19%, while the overall rate is 37%.
701	In the cities, a majority of families, well beyond those officially classified as poor, have to adopt a variety of survival strategies.
701	At the same time, in urban areas social inequality is most evident, and assumes extreme forms in the capital, Luanda.
701	In the Human Development Index Angola constantly ranks in the bottom group.
701	According to The Heritage Foundation, a conservative American think tank, oil production froAccording to corruption: according to a recent Human Rights Watch report, 32 billion US dollars disappeared from government accounts from 2007 to 2010.
701	Before independence in 1975, Angola was a breadbasket of southern Africa and a major exporter of bananas, coffee and sisal, but three decades of civil war (1975–2002) destroyed the fertile countryside, leaving it littered with landmines and driving millions into the cities.
701	The country now depends on expensive food imports, mainly from South Africa and Portugal, while more than 90 percent of farming is done at family and subsistence level.
701	Thousands of Angolan small-scale farmers are trapped in poverty.
701	The enormous differences between the regions pose a serious structural problem in the Angolan economy.
701	This is best illustrated by the fact that about one third of the economic activities is concentrated in Luanda and the neighbouring Bengo province, while several areas of the interior are characterized by stagnation and even regression.
701	One of the economic consequences of the social and regional disparities is a sharp increase in Angolan private investments abroad.
701	The small fringe of Angolan society where most of the accumulation takes place seeks to spread its assets, for reasons of security and profit.
701	For the time being, the biggest share of these investments is concentrated in Portugal where the Angolan presence (including that of the family of the state president) in banks as well as in the domains of energy, telecommunications, and mass media has become notable, as has the acquisition of vineyards and orchards as well as of touristic enterprises.
701	Demographics  Angola's population is estimated to be 18,056,072 (2012).
701	It is composed of Ovimbundu (language Umbundu) 37%, Ambundu (language Kimbundu) 25%, Bakongo 13%, and 32% other ethnic groups (including the Chokwe, the Ovambo, the Mbunda, with the latter having been replaced by Ganguela, a generic term for peoples east of the Central Highlands, which has a slightly derogatory meaning when applied by the western ethnic groups, and the Xindonga) as well as about 2% mestiços (mixed European and African), 1.4% Chinese and 1% European The Ambundu and Ovimbundu nations combined form a majority of the population, at 62%.
701	The population is forecast to grow to over 47 million people to 2060, nearly tripling the estimated 16 to 18 million in 2011.
701	The last official census was taken in 1970, and showed the total population as being 5.6 million.
701	The first post-independence census is to be held in 2014.
701	It is estimated that Angola was host to 12,100 refugees and 2,900 asylum seekers by the end of 2007.
701	Democratic Republic of Congo (Congo-Kinshasa) who arrived in the 1970s.
701	As of 2008 there were an estimated 400,000 DRC migrant workers, at least 30,000 Portuguese, and about 259,000 Chinese living in Angola.
701	Since 2003, more than 400,000 Congolese migrants have been expelled from Angola.
701	Prior to independence in 1975, Angola had a community of approximately 350,000 Portuguese; currently, there are about 120,000 who are registered with the consulates, and increasing due to the debt crisis in Portugal.
701	The Chinese population stands at 258,920, mostly composed of temporary migrants.
701	The total fertility rate of Angola is 5.54 children born per woman (2012 estimates), the 11th highest in the world.
701	Languages  The languages in Angola are those originally spoken by the different ethnic groups plus Portuguese due to the country being a former Portuguese colony.
701	The indigenous languages with the largest usage are Umbundu, Kimbundu, and Kikongo, in that order.
701	Portuguese is the official language of the country.
701	Mastery of the official language is probably more extended in Angola than it is  elsewhere in Africa, and this certainly applies to its use in everyday life.
701	Moreover, and above all, the proportion of native (or near native) speakers of the language of the former colonizer, turned official after independence, is no doubt considerably higher than in any other African country.
701	There are three intertwined historical reasons for this situation.
701	In the Portuguese “bridgeheads” Luanda and Benguela, which existed on the coast of what today is Angola since the 15th and 16th century, respectively, Portuguese was spoken not only by the Portuguese and their mestiço descendents, but—especially in and around Luanda—by a significant number of Africans, although these always remained native speakers of their local African language.
701	Since the Portuguese conquest of the present territory of Angola, and especially since its “effective occupation” in the mid-1920s, schooling in Portuguese was slowly developed by the colonial state as well as by Catholic and Protestant missions.
701	The rhythm of this expansion was considerably accelerated during the late colonial period, 1961–1974, so that by the end of the colonial period children all over the territory (with relatively few exceptions) had at least some access to the Portuguese language.
701	In the same late colonial period, the legal discrimination of the black population was abolished, and the state apparatus in fields like health, education, social work, and rural development was enlarged.
701	This entailed a significant increase in jobs for Africans, under the condition that they spoke Portuguese.
701	As a consequence of all this, the African “lower middle class” which at that stage formed in Luanda and other cities began to often prevent their children from learning the local African language, in order to guarantee that they learned Portuguese as their native language.
701	At the same time, the white and “mestiço” population, where some knowledge of African languages could previously often been found, neglected this aspect more and more, to the point of frequently ignoring it totally.
701	After independence, these tendencies continued, and were even strengthened, under the rule of the MPLA which has its main social roots exactly in those social segments where the mastery of Portuguese as well as the proportion of native Portuguese speakers was highest.
701	This became a political side issue, as FNLA as well as UNITA, given their regional constituencies, came out in favour of a greater attention to the African languages, and as the FNLA favoured French over Portuguese.
701	The dynamics of the language situation, as described above, were additionally fostered by the massive migrations triggered by the Civil War.
701	Ovimbundu, the most populous ethnic group and the most affected by the war, appeared in great numbers in urban areas outside their areas, especially in Luanda and surroundings.
701	At the same time, a majority of the Bakongo who had fled to the Democratic Republic of Congo in the early 1960s, or of their children and grandchildren, returned to Angola, but mostly did not settle in their original "habitat", but in the cities—and again above all in Luanda.
701	As a consequence, more than half the population is now living in the cities which, from the linguistic point of view, have become highly heterogeneous.
701	This means, of course, that Portuguese as the overall language of communication is by now of paramount importance, and that the role of the African languages is steadily decreasing among the urban population—a trend which is beginning to spread into rural areas as well.
701	The exact numbers of those fluent in Portuguese or who speak Portuguese as a first language are unknown, although a census is expected to be carried out in 2013.
701	Quite a number of voices demand the recognition of “Angolan Portuguese” as a specific variant, comparable to those spoken in Portugal or in Brazil.
701	However, while there exists a certain number of idiomatic particularities in everyday Portuguese, as spoken by Angolans, it remains to be seen whether or not the Angolan government comes to the conclusion that these particularities constitute a configuration that justifies the claim to be a new language variant.
701	Religion  There are about 1000 mostly Christian religious communities in Angola.
701	While reliable statistics are nonexistent, estimates have it that more than half of the population are Roman Catholics, while about a quarter adhere to the Protestant churches introduced during the colonial period: the Congregationalists mainly among the Ovimbundu of the Central Highlands and the coastal region to its West, the Methodists concentrating on the Kimbundu speaking strip from Luanda to Malanje, the Baptists almost exclusively among the Bakongo of the Northwest (now massively present in Luanda as well) and dispersed Adventists, Reformed and Lutherans.
701	In Luanda and region there subsists a nucleus of the "syncretic" Tocoists and in the northwest a sprinkling of  Kimbanguism can be found, spreading from the Congo/Zaire.
701	Since independence, hundreds of Pentecostal and similar communities have sprung up in the cities, where by now about 50% of the population is living; several of these communities/churches are of Brazilian origin.
701	The  Muslims, practically all of them immigrants from West African and other countries and belonging to the Sunnite branch, represent only about 1%; because of their diversity, they do not form a community.
701	In 2011, according to the Islamic Community of Angola (Comunidade Islâmica de Angola, COIA) there were more than 80 mosques serving about 500,000 Muslims in Angola, and the number was growing.
701	In a study assessing nations' levels of religious regulation and persecution with scores ranging from 0 to 10 where 0 represented low levels of regulation or persecution, Angola was scored 0.8 on Government Regulation of Religion, 4.0 on Social Regulation of Religion, 0 on Government Favoritism of Religion and 0 on Religious Persecution.
701	Foreign missionaries were very active prior to independence in 1975, although since the beginning of the anti-colonial fight in 1961 the Portuguese colonial authorities expelled a series of Protestant missionaries and closed mission stations based on the belief that the missionaries were inciting pro-independence sentiments.
701	Missionaries have been able to return to the country since the early 1990s, although security conditions due to the civil war have prevented them until 2002 from restoring many of their former inland mission stations.
701	The Roman Catholic and some major Protestant denominations mostly keep to themselves in contrast to the "New Churches" which actively proselytize.
701	The Roman Catholic as well as some major Protestant denominations provide help for the poor in the form of crop seeds, farm animals, medical care and education.
701	Largest cities  Health  Epidemics of cholera, malaria, rabies and African hemorrhagic fevers like Marburg hemorrhagic fever, are common diseases in several parts of the country.
701	Many regions in this country have high incidence rates of tuberculosis and high HIV prevalence rates.
701	Dengue, filariasis, leishmaniasis, and onchocerciasis (river blindness) are other diseases carried by insects that also occur in the region.
701	Angola has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world and one of the world's lowest life expectancies.
701	A 2007 survey concluded that low and deficient niacin status was common in Angola.
701	Demographic and Health Surveys is currently conducting several surveys in Angola on malaria, domestic violence and more.
701	Education  Although by law, education in Angola is compulsory and free for eight years, the government reports that a certain percentage of students are not attending school due to a lack of school buildings and teachers.
701	Students are often responsible for paying additional school-related expenses, including fees for books and supplies.
701	In 1999, the gross primary enrollment rate was 74 percent and in 1998, the most recent year for which data are available, the net primary enrollment rate was 61 percent.
701	Gross and net enrollment ratios are based on the number of students formally registered in primary school and therefore do not necessarily reflect actual school attendance.
701	There continue to be significant disparities in enrollment between rural and urban areas.
701	In 1995, 71.2 percent of children ages 7 to 14 years were attending school.
701	It is reported that higher percentages of boys attend school than girls.
701	During the Angolan Civil War (1975–2002), nearly half of all schools were reportedly looted and destroyed, leading to current problems with overcrowding.
701	The Ministry of Education hired 20,000 new teachers in 2005, and continued to implement teacher trainings.
701	Teachers tend to be underpaid, inadequately trained, and overworked (sometimes teaching two or three shifts a day).
701	Some teachers may also reportedly demand payment or bribes directly from their students.
701	Other factors, such as the presence of landmines, lack of resources and identity papers, and poor health also prevent children from regularly attending school.
701	Although budgetary allocations for education were increased in 2004, the education system in Angola continues to be extremely under-funded.
701	Literacy is quite low, with 67.4% of the population over the age of 15 able to read and write in Portuguese.
701	Since independence from Portugal in 1975, a number of Angolan students continued to be admitted every year at high schools, polytechnical institutes, and universities in Portugal, Brazil and Cuba through bilateral agreements; in general, these students belong to the Angolan elites.
701	Culture  Portugal has been present in Angola for 400 years, occupied the territory in the 19th and early 20th century, and ruled over it for about 50 years.
701	As a consequence, both countries share cultural aspects: language (Portuguese) and main religion (Roman Catholic Christianity).
701	The substrate of Angolan culture is African,  mostly Bantu, while Portuguese culture has be is African,  meen imported.
701	The diverse ethnic communities  – the Ovimbundu, Ambundu, Bakongo, Chokwe, Mbunda and other peoples – maintain to varying degrees their own cultural traits, traditions and languages, but in the cities, where slightly more than half of the population now lives, a mixed culture has been emerging since colonial times – in Luanda since its foundation in the 16th century.
701	In this urban culture, the Portuguese heritage has become more and more dominant.
701	An African influence is evident in music and dance, and is moulding the way in which Portuguese is spoken, but is almost disappearing from the vocabulary.
701	This process is well reflected in contemporary Angolan literature, especially in the works of Pepetela and Ana Paula Ribeiro Tavares.
701	Leila Lopes, Miss Angola 2011, was crowned Miss Universe 2011 in Brazil on 12 September 2011 making her the first Angolan to win the pageant.

704	This article is about the demographic features of the population of Angola, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.
704	Ethnically, three main groups have to be distinguished, each speaking a Bantu language: the Ovimbundu who represent 37% of the population, the (Ambundu) with 25%, and the Bakongo 13%.
704	Other numerically important groups include the closely interrelated Chokwe and Lunda, the Ganguela and Nhaneca-Humbe, in both cases classification terms which stand for a variety of small groups, the Ovambo, the Herero,  the Xindonga and scattered residual groups of Khoisan.
704	In addition, mixed race (European and African) people amount to about 2%, with a small (1%) population of whites, mainly ethnically Portuguese (as a former overseas territory of Portugal until 1975, the Portuguese make up currently the largest non-African population, with more than 200,000 in 2012, a number that has been constantly increasing from the 2000s, because of Angola's growing demand for qualified human resources.
704	Besides the Portuguese, significant numbers of people from other European and from diverse Latin American countries (especially Brazil) can be found.
704	From the 2000s many Chinese have settled and started up small businesses, while at least as many have come as workforce for large (construction or other) enterprises.
704	Observers claim that the Chinese community in Angola might include as many as 300,000 persons at the end of 2010, but nothing near to reliable statistics are at this stage available on this point.
704	In 1974/75, up to 250,000 Cuban soldiers arrived in Angola to help the MPLA forces during the decolonisation conflict.
704	Once this was over, a massive development cooperation in the field of health and education brought in numerous civil personnel from Cuba.
704	However, only a very small percentage of all these people has remained in Angola, either for personal reasons (intermarriage) or as professionals (e.g.
704	The largest religious denomination  is Roman Catholicism, to which adheres about half the population.
704	Roughly 26% are followers of traditional forms of Protestantism (Congregationals, Methodists, Baptista, Lutherans, Reformed), but over the last decades there has in addition been a growth of Pentecostal communities and African Initiated Churches.
704	In 2006, one out of 221 people were Jehovah's Witnesses.
704	Blacks from Mali, Nigeria and Senegal are mostly Sunnite Muslims, but do not make up more than 1 - 2% of the population.
704	By now few Angolans retain African traditional religions following different ethnic faiths.
704	Population According to the 2010 revison of the World Population Prospects the total population was 19 082 000 in 2010, compared to only 4 148 000 in 1950.

704	Ethnic groups 37% of Angolans are Ovimbundu, 25% are Ambundu, 13% are Bakongo, 2% are mestiço, 1-2% are white settlers, and people from other ethnicities make up 22% of Angola's population.
704	Religions Angola is a majority Christian country.
704	Reliable statistics don't exist, but well over 80% belong in principle to a Christian church or community, although many of them don't practice their religion and are in fact non believers.
704	More than half of the Christians (whether practizing or not) are Roman Catholic, the remaining ones comprising members of traditional Protestant churches as well as of new, often Pentecostal communities.
704	Only 1 - 2% are Muslims  - generally immmigrants from other African countries.
704	Traditional indigenous religions are practized by a very small minority, generally in peripheral rural societies; however, some traditional beliefs are held by a substantial number of Christians.
704	Education Literacy is quite low, with 67.4% of the population over the age of 15 able to read and write in Portuguese.
704	Languages Portuguese is the official language of Angola, but Bantu and other African languages are also widely spoken.
704	In fact, Kikongo, Kimbundu, Umbundu, Tuchokwe, Nganguela, and Ukanyama have the official status of "national languages".
704	The mastery of Portuguese is widespread; in the cities the overwhelming majority are either fluent in Portuguese or have at least a reasonable working knowledge of this language; an increasing minority are native Portuguese speakers and have a poor, if any, knowledge of an African language.
705	Since the adoption of a new constitution, early in 2010, the politics of Angola takes place in a framework of a presidential republic, whereby the President of Angola is both head of state and head of government, and of a  multi-party system.
705	Executive power is exercised by the government.
705	Legislative power is vested in the President, the government and parliament.
705	Angola changed from a one-party Marxist-Leninist system ruled by the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), in place since independence in 1975, to a multiparty democracy based on a new constitution adopted in 1992.
705	That same year, first parliamentary and presidential elections were held.
705	In the former, the MPLA won an absolute majority.
705	In the latter, President José Eduardo dos Santos won the first round election with more than 49% of the vote to Jonas Savimbi's 40%.
705	A runoff election would have been necessary, but never took place.
705	The renewal of civil war immediately after the elections, which were considered as fraudulent by UNITA, and the collapse of the Lusaka Protocol, created a split situation.
705	On the one hand, the new democratic institutions worked, notably the National Assembly, with the active participation of UNITA's and the FNLA's elected MPs  - while José Eduardo dos Santos continued to exercise his functions without democratic legitimation.
705	An the other hand, the armed forces of the MPLA (now the official armed forces of the Angolan state) and of UNITA fought each other until the leader of UNITA, Jonas Savimbi, was killed in action, in 2002.
705	From 2002 to 2010, the system as defined by the constitution of 1992 functioned in a relatively normal way.
705	The executive branch of the government was composed of the President, the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers.
705	The Council of Ministers, composed of all ministers and vice ministers, met regularly to discuss policy issues.
705	Governors of the 18 provinces were appointed by and served at the pleasure of the president.
705	The Constitutional Law of 1992 established the broad outlines of government structure and the rights and duties of citizens.
705	The legal system was based on Portuguese and customary law but was weak and fragmented.
705	Courts operated in only 12 of more than 140 municipalities.
705	A Supreme Court served as the appellate tribunal; a Constitutional Court with powers of judicial review was never constituted despite statutory authorization.
705	In practice,  power was more and more concentrated in the hands of the President who, supported by an ever increasing staff, largely controlled parliament, government, and the judiciary.
705	The 26-year long civil war has ravaged the country's political and social institutions.
705	The UN estimates of 1.8 million internally displaced persons (IDPs), while generally the accepted figure for war-affected people is 4 million.
705	Daily conditions of life throughout the country and specifically Luanda (population approximately 4 million) mirror the collapse of administrative infrastructure as well as many social institutions.
705	The ongoing grave economic situation largely prevents any government support for social institutions.
705	Hospitals are without medicines or basic equipment, schools are without books, and public employees often lack the basic supplies for their day-to-day work.
705	The 2010 constitution grants the President almost absolute power.
705	Elections for the National assembly are to take place every five years, and the President is automatically the leader of the winning party or coalition.
705	It is for the President to appoint (and dismiss) all of the following: * The members of the government (state ministers, ministers, state secretaries and vice-ministers); * The members of the Constitutional Court; * The members of the Supreme Court; * The members of the Court of Auditors; * The members of the Military Supreme Court; * The Governor and Vice-Governors of the Nacional Angolan Bank; * The General-Attorney, the Vice-General-Attorneys and their deputies (as well as the military homologous); * The Governors of the provinces; * The members of the Republic Council; * The members of the National Security Council; * The members of the Superior Magistrates Councils; * The General Chief of the Armed Forces and his deputy; * All other command posts in the military; * The Police General Commander, and the 2nd in command; * All other command posts in the police; * The chiefs and directors of the intelligence and security organs.
705	The President is also provided a variety of powers, like defining the policy of the country.
705	Even though it's not up to him/her to make laws (only to promulgate them and make edicts), the President is the leader of the winning party.
705	The only "relevant" post that is not directly appointed by the President is the Vice-President, which is the second in the winning party.
705	Executive branch |} Legislative branch The National Assembly (Assembleia Nacional) has 223 members, elected for a four year term, 130 members by proportional representation, 90 members in provincial districts, and 3 members to represent Angolans abroad.
705	The next general elections, due for 1997, have been rescheduled for 5 September 2008.
705	The ruling party MPLA won 82% (191 seats in the National Assembly) and the main opposition party won only 10% (16 seats).
705	The elections however have been described as only partly free but certainly not fair.
705	A White Book on the elections in 2008 lists up all irregularities surrounding the Parliamentary elections of 2008.
705	Political parties and elections Parliamentary elections were held in September 2008.
705	These elections were the first since 1992.
705	Presidential elections are planned for 2009.
705	Judicial branch Supreme Court (or "Tribunal da Relacao") judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the president.

706	The Economy of Angola is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, with the Economist asserting that for 2001 to 2010, Angolas' Annual average GDP growth was 11.1 percent.
706	It is still recovering from the Angolan Civil War that plagued Angola from independence in 1975 until 2002.
706	Despite extensive oil and gas resources, diamonds, hydroelectric potential, and rich agricultural land, Angola remains poor, and a third of the population relies on subsistence agriculture.
706	Since 2002, when the 27-year civil war ended, the country has worked to repair and improve ravaged infrastructure and weakened political and social institutions.
706	High international oil prices and rising oil production have led to a very strong economic growth in recent years, but corruption and public-sector mismanagement remain, particularly in the oil sector, which accounts for over 50 percent of GDP, over 90 percent of export revenue, and over 80 percent of government revenue.
706	History Kingdom of Portugal's explorers and settlers, founded trading posts and forts along the coast of Africa since the 15th century, and reached the Angolan coast in the 16th century.
706	Portuguese explorer Paulo Dias de Novais founded Luanda in 1575 as "São Paulo de Loanda", and the region developed as a slave trade market with the help of local Imbangala and Mbundu peoples who were notable slave hunters.
706	Trade was mostly with the Portuguese colony of Brazil; Brazilian ships were the most numerous in the ports of Luanda and Benguela.
706	By this time, Angola, a Portuguese colony, was in fact like a colony of Brazil, paradoxically another Portuguese colony.
706	A strong Brazilian influence was also exercised by the Jesuits in religion and education.
706	War gradually gave way to the philosophy of trade.
706	The great trade routes and the agreements that made them possible were the driving force for activities between the different areas; warlike states become states ready to produce and to sell.
706	In the Planalto (the high plains), the most important states were those of Bié and Bailundo, the latter being noted for its production of foodstuffs and rubber.
706	The colonial power, Portugal, becoming ever richer and more powerful, would not tolerate the growth of these neighbouring states and subjugated them one by one, so that by the beginning of this century the Portuguese had complete control over the entire area.
706	During the period of the Iberian Union (1580–1640), Portugal lost influence and power and made new enemies.
706	The Dutch, a major enemy of Castile, invaded many Portuguese overseas possessions, including Luanda.
706	The Dutch ruled Luanda from 1640 to 1648 as Fort Aardenburgh.
706	They were seeking black slaves for use in sugarcane plantations of Northeastern Brazil (Pernambuco, Olinda, Recife) which they had also seized from Portugal.
706	John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen, conquered the Portuguese possessions of Saint George del Mina, Saint Thomas, and Luanda, Angola, on the west coast of Africa.
706	After the dissolution of the Iberian Union in 1640, Portugal would reestablish its authority over the lost territories of the Portuguese Empire.
706	The Portuguese started to develop townships, trading posts, logging camps and small processing factories.
706	From 1764 onwards, there was a gradual change from a slave-based society to one based on production for domestic consumption and export.
706	Meanwhile, with the independence of Brazil in 1822, the slave trade was abolished in 1836, and in 1844 Angola's ports were opened to foreign shipping.
706	By 1850, Luanda was one of the greatest and most developed Portuguese cities in the vast Portuguese Empire outside Mainland Portugal, full of trading companies, exporting (together with Benguela) palm and peanut oil, wax, copal, timber, ivory, cotton, coffee, and cocoa, among many other products.
706	Maize, tobacco, dried meat and cassava flour also began to be produced locally.
706	The Angolan bourgeoisie was born.
706	From the 1920s to the 1960s, strong economic growth, abundant natural resources and development of infrastruture, led to the arrival of even more Portuguese settlers.
706	The Portuguese discovered petroleum in Angola in 1955.
706	Production began in the Cuanza basin in the 1950s, in the Congo basin in the 1960s, and in the exclave of Cabinda in 1968.
706	The Portuguese government granted operating rights for Block Zero to the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company, a subsidiary of ChevronTexaco, in 1955.
706	Oil production surpassed the exportation of coffee as Angola's largest export in 1973.
706	A leftist military-led coup d'état, started on April 25, 1974, in Lisbon, overthrew the Marcelo Caetano government in Portugal, and promised to hand over power to an independent Angolan government.
706	Mobutu Sese Seko, the President of Zaire, met with António de Spínola, the transitional President of Portugal, on September 15, 1974 on Sal island in Cape Verde, crafting a plan to empower Holden Roberto of the National Liberation Front of Angola, Jonas Savimbi of UNITA, and Daniel Chipenda of the MPLA's eastern faction at the expense of MPLA leader Agostinho Neto while retaining the façade of national unity.
706	Mobutu and Spínola wanted to present Chipenda as the MPLA head, Mobutu particularly preferring Chipenda over Neto because Chipenda supported autonomy for Cabinda.
706	The ring Chipenda over Angolan exclave has immense petroleum reserves estimated at around 300 million tons (~300 kg) which Zaire, and thus the Mobutu government, depended on for economic survival.
706	After independence thousands of white Portuguese left, most of them to Portugal and many travelling overland to South Africa.
706	There was an immediate crisis because the indigenous African population lacked the skills and knowledge needed to run the country and maintain its well-developed infrastructure.
706	The Angolan government created Sonangol, a state-run oil company, in 1976.
706	Two years later Sonangol received the rights to oil exploration and production in all of Angola.
706	After independence from Portugal in 1975, Angola was ravaged by a horrific civil war between 1975 and 2002.
706	United Nations Angola Verification Mission III and MONUA spent USD1.5 billion overseeing implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, a 1994 peace accord that ultimately failed to end the civil war.
706	The protocol prohibited UNITA from buying foreign arms, a provision the United Nations largely did not enforce, so both sides continued to build up their stockpile.
706	UNITA purchased weapons in 1996 and 1997 from private sources in Albania and Bulgaria, and from Zaire, South Africa, Republic of the Congo, Zambia, Togo, and Burkina Faso.
706	In October 1997 the UN imposed travel sanctions on UNITA leaders, but the UN waited untihttp://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?titleEconomy_of_Angola&action edit&section=1#l July 1998 to limit UNITA's exportation of diamonds and freeze UNITA bank accounts.
706	While the U.S.
706	USD250 million to UNITA between 1986 to 1991, UNITA made USD1.72 billion between 1994 and 1999 exporting diamonds, primarily through Zaire to Europe.
706	At the same time the Angolan government received large amounts of weapons from the governments of Belarus, Brazil, Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, and South Africa.
706	While no arms shipment to the government violated the protocol, no country informed the U.N.
706	Register on Conventional Weapons as required.
706	Despite the increase in civil warfare in late 1998, the economy grew by an estimated 4% in 1999.
706	The government introduced new currency denominations in 1999, including a 1 and 5 kwanza note.
706	An economic reform effort was launched in 1998.
706	Angola ranked 160 out of 174 nations in the United Nations Human Development Index of 2000.
706	In April 2000 Angola started an International Monetary Fund (IMF) Staff-Monitored Program (SMP).
706	The program formally lapsed in June 2001, but the IMF remains engaged.
706	In this context the Government of Angola has succeeded in unifying exchange rates and has raised fuel, electricity, and water rates.
706	The Commercial Code, telecommunications law, and Foreign Investment Code are being modernized.
706	A privatization effort, prepared with World Bank assistance, has begun with the BCI bank.
706	Nevertheless, a legacy of fiscal mismanagement and corruption persists.
706	The civil war internally displaced 3.8 million people, 32% of the population, by 2001.
706	The security brought about by the 2002 peace settlement has led to the resettlement of 4 million displaced persons, thus resulting in large-scale increases in agriculture production.
706	Angola produced over 3 million carats of diamonds per year in 2003, with its production expected to grow to 10 million carats per year by 2007.
706	In 2004 China's Eximbank approved a $2 billion line of credit to Angola to rebuild infrastructure.
706	The economy grew 18% in 2005 and growth was expected to reach 26% in 2006 and stay above 10% for the rest of the decade.
706	The construction industry is another sector taking advantage of the growing economy, with various housing projects stimulated by the government that created various initiatives for this.
706	Examples are the program Angola Investe and the projects Casa Feliz or Meña.
706	However, not all public construction projects are functional; a case in point is Kilamba Kiaxi where a whole new satellite town of Luanda, consisting in the main of housing faclities for several hundreds of thousends of people, remains practically uninhabited, because of prices that are out of reach even for the middle class.
706	ChevronTexaco started pumping 50 koilbbl/d from Block 14 in January 2000, but production has decreased to 57 koilbbl/d in 2007 due to the poor quality of the oil.
706	Angola joined the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on January 1, 2007.
706	Cabinda Gulf Oil Company found Malange-1, an oil reservoir in Block 14, on August 9, 2007.
706	Overview Despite its abundant natural resources, output per capita is among the world's lowest.
706	Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 85% of the population.
706	Oil production and the supporting activities are vital to the economy, contributing about 45% to GDP and 90% of exports.
706	Growth is almost entirely driven by rising oil production which surpassed  in late-2005 and which is expected to grow to 2 Moilbbl/d by 2007.
706	Control of the oil industry is consolidated in Sonangol Group, a conglomerate which is owned by the Angolan government.
706	With revenues booming from oil exports, the government has started to implement ambitious development programs in building roads and other basic infrastructure for the nation.
706	In the last decade of the colonial period, Angola was a major African food exporter but now imports almost all its food.
706	Because of severe wartime conditions, including extensive planting of landmines throughout the countryside, agricultural activities have been brought to a near standstill.
706	Some efforts to recover have gone forward, however, notably in fisheries.
706	Coffee production, though a fraction of its pre-1975 level, is sufficient for domestic needs and some exports.
706	In sharp contrast to a bleak picture of devastation and bare subsistence is expanding oil production, now almost half of GDP and 90% of exports, at 800 koilbbl/d.
706	Diamonds provided much of the revenue for Jonas Savimbi's UNITA rebellion through illicit trade.
706	Other rich resources await development: gold, forest products, fisheries, iron ore, coffee, and fruits.
706	This is a chart of trend of nominal gross domestic produThis is a chct of Angola at market prices using International Monetary Fund data; figures are in millions of units.
706	Foreign trade Exports in 2004 reached US$10,530,764,911.
706	The vast majority of Angola's exports, 92% in 2004, are petroleum products.
706	US$785 million worth of diamonds, 7.5% of exports, were sold abroad that year.
706	Nearly all of Angola's oil goes to the United States, 526 koilbbl/d in 2006, making it the eighth largest supplier of oil to the United States, and to the People's Republic of China, 477 koilbbl/d in 2006.
706	In the first quarter of 2008, Angola became the main exporter of oil to China.
706	The rest of its petroleum exports go to Europe and Latin America.

706	From the 2000s many Chinese have settled and started up businesses.
706	Resources Petroleum Angola produces and exports more petroleum than any other nation in sub-Saharan Africa, surpassing Nigeria in the 2000s.
706	In January 2007 Angola became a member of OPEC.
706	By 2010 production is expected to double the 2006 output level with development of deep-water offshore oil fields.
706	Oil sales generated USD 1.71 billion in tax revenue in 2004 and now makes up 80% of the government's budget, a 5% increase from 2003, and 45% of GDP.
706	Chevron Corporation produces and receives 400 koilbbl/d, 27% of Angolan oil.
706	Elf Oil, Texaco, ExxonMobil, Agip, Petrobras, and British Petroleum also operate in the country.
706	Block Zero provides the majority of Angola's crude oil production with 370 koilbbl/d produced annually.
706	The largest fields in Block Zero are Takula (Area A), Numbi (Area A), and Kokongo (Area B).
706	ChevronTexaco operates in Block Zero with a 39.2% share.
706	SONANGOL, the state oil company, Total, and ENI-Agip own the rest of the block.
706	ChevronTexaco also operates Angola's first producing deepwater section, Block 14, with 57 koilbbl/d.
706	The United Nations has criticized the Angolan government for using torture, rape, summary executions, arbitrary detention, and disappearances, actions which Angolan government has justified on the need to maintain oil output.
706	Angola is the third-largest trading partner of the United States in Sub-Saharan Africa, largely because of its petroleum exports.

706	Government has invested USD $4 billion in Angola's petroleum sector.
706	Diamonds Angola is the third largest producer of diamonds in Africa and has only explored 40% of the diamond-rich territory within the country, but has had difficulty in attracting foreign investment because of corruption, human rights violations, and diamond smuggling.
706	Production rose by 30% in 2006 and Endiama, the national diamond company of Angola, expects production to increase by 8% in 2007 to 10 million carats annually.
706	The government is trying to attract foreign companies to the provinces of Bié, Malanje and Uíge.
706	The Angolan government loses $375 million annually from diamond smuggling.
706	In 2003 the government began Operation Brilliant, an anti-smuggling investigation that arrested and deported 250,000 smugglers between 2003 and 2006.
706	Rafael Marques, a journalist and human rights activist, described the diamond industry in his 2006 Angola's Deadly Diamonds report as plagued by "murders, beatings, arbitrary detentions and other human rights violations."
706	Marques called on foreign countries to boycott Angola's "conflict diamonds".
706	Iron Under Portuguese rule, Angola began mining iron in 1957, producing 1.2 million tons in 1967 and 6.2 million tons by 1971.
706	In the early 1970s, 70% of Portuguese Angola's iron exports went to Western Europe and Japan.
706	After independence in 1975, the Angolan Civil War (1975–2002) destroyed most of the territory's mining infrastructure.
706	The redevelopment of the Angolan mining industry started in the late 2000s.
708	Transport in Angola comprises: Railways  There are three separate railway lines in Angola: * Luanda Railway (northern) * Benguela Railway (central) * Moçâmedes Railway (southern) Reconstruction of these three lines began in 2005 and is expected to be completed by the end of the year 2012.
708	The Benguela Railway already connects to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
708	Highways  * total: 52,429 km country comparison to the world: 79 * paved: 5,349 km * unpaved: 46,080 km (2001) Travel on highways outside of towns and cities in Angola (and in some cases within) is often not best advised for those without four-by-four vehicles.
708	Whilst a reasonable road infrastructure has existed within Angola, time and the war have taken their toll on the road surfaces, leaving many severely potholed, littered with broken asphalt.
708	In many areas drivers have established alternate tracks to avoid the worst parts of the surface, although careful attention must be paid to the presence or absence of landmine warning markers by the side of the road.
708	The Angolan government has contracted the restoration of many of the country's roads, though.
708	Many companies are coming into the country from China and surrounding nations to help improve road surfaces.
708	The road between Lubango and Namibe, for example, was completed recently with funding from the European Union, and is comparable to many European main routes.
708	Progress to complete the road infrastructure is likely to take some decades, but substantial efforts are already being made in the right directions.

708	There are airstrips for domestic transport at Benguela, Cabinda, Huambo, Namibe, and Catumbela.
709	The Angolan Armed Forces (Portuguese: Forças Armadas Angolanas) are the military in Angola that succeeded Forças Armadas de Libertação de Angola (FAPLA) following the abortive Bicesse Accord with UNITA in 1991.
709	As part of the peace agreement, troops from both armies were to be demilitarized and then integrated.
709	Integration was never completed as UNITA went back to war in 1992.
709	Later, consequences for UNITA members in Luanda were harsh with FAPLA veterans persecuting their erstwhile opponents in certain areas and reports of vigilantism.
709	The FAA is headed by Chief of Staff Geraldo Sachipengo Nunda since 2010, who reports to the Minister of Defense, actually Cândido Pereira Van-Dúnem.
709	There are three components, the Army (Forças Armadas), Navy (Marinha de Guerra) and Air Force Força Aérea Nacional Angolana.
709	Total manpower is about 130,500.
709	The army is by far the largest of the services with about 120,000 men and women.
709	The Navy numbers about 2,500 and operates seven small patrol craft and barges.

709	A presence during the unrest in Côte d'Ivoire, 2010–2011, were not officially confirmed.
709	Angola is basically interested in the participation of the FAA operations of the African Union and has formed special units for this purpose.
709	The Angolan army has around 29,000 "ghost workers" who remain enrolled in the ranks of the FAA and therefore receive a salary.
709	Major equipment included over 140 main battle tanks, 600 reconnaissance vehicles, over 320 armored vehicles, infantry fighting vehicles, 298 howitzers carriers.
709	As of 2013, the Army has three military regions and 16 'brigades', comprising infantry, tanks, APC, artillery, and AA units as required.
709	The Angolan Navy (MGA) has been neglected and ignored as a military arm mainly due to the guerrilla struggle against the Portuguese and the nature of the civil war.
709	From the early 1990s to the present the Angolan Navy has shrunk from around 4 200 personnel to around 1 000, resulting in the loss of skills and expertise needed to maintain equipment.
709	In order to protect Angola’s 1 600 km long coastline, the Angolan Navy is undergoing modernisation but is still lacking in many ways.
709	Portugal has been providing training through its Technical Military Cooperation (CTM) programme.
709	With regard to procurement, the Navy has a request for a frigate, three corvettes, three offshore patrol vessel and additional fast patrol boats.

709	In the case of the latter, the 2012 Guinea-Bissau coup d'état was cited by the coup leaders as due to Angola's involvement in trying to "reform" the military in connivance with the civilian leadership.
710	The foreign relations of Angola are based on Angola's strong support of U.S.
710	Angolan economy is dependent on U.S.
710	From 1975 to 1989, Angola was aligned with the Eastern bloc, in particular the Soviet Union, Libya, and Cuba.
710	Since then, it has focused on improving relationships with Western countries, cultivating links with other Portuguese-speaking countries, and asserting its own national interests in Central Africa through military and diplomatic intervention.
710	In 1993, it established formal diplomatic relations with the United States.
710	It has entered the Southern African Development Community as a vehicle for improving ties with its largely Anglophone neighbors to the south.
710	Zimbabwe and Namibia joined Angola in its military intervention in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where Angolan troops remain in support of the Joseph Kabila government.
710	It also has intervened in the Republic of the Congo (Brazzaville) to support the existing government in that country.
710	Since 1998, Angola has successfully worked with the United Nations Security Council to impose and carry out sanctions on UNITA.
710	More recently, it has extended those efforts to controls on conflict diamonds, the primary source of revenue for UNITA.
710	At the same time, Angola has promoted the revival of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP) as a forum for cultural exchange and expanding ties with Portugal (its former ruler) and Brazil (which shares many cultural affinities with Angola) in particular.
710	Sub-Saharan Africa Cape Verde Cape Verde signed a friendship accord with Angola in December 1975, shortly after Angola gained its independence.
710	Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau served as stop-over points for Cuban troops on their way to Angola to fight UNITA rebels and South African troops.
710	Prime Minister Pedro Pires sent FARP soldiers to Angola where they served as the personal bodyguards of Angolan President José Eduardo dos Santos.
710	Democratic Republic of the Congo Many thousands of Angolans fled the country after the civil war.
710	More than 20,000 people were forced to leave the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2009, an action the DR Congo said was in retaliation for regular expulsion of Congolese diamond miners who were in Angola illegally.
710	Angola sent a delegation to DR Congo's capital Kinshasa and succeeded in stopping government-forced expulsions which had become a "tit-for-tat" immigration dispute.
710	"Congo and Angola have agreed to suspend expulsions from both sides of the border," said Lambert Mende, DR Congo information minister, in October 2009.
710	"We never challenged the expulsions themselves; we challenged the way they were being conducted — all the beating of people and looting their goods, even sometimes their clothes," Mende said.
710	Namibia Namibia borders Angola to the south.
710	In 1999 Namibia signed a mutual defense pact with its northern neighbor Angola.
710	This affected the Angolan Civil War that had been ongoing since Angola's independence in 1975.
710	Namibia's ruling party SWAPO sought to support the ruling party MPLA in Angola against the rebel movement UNITA, whose stronghold is in southern Angola, bordering to Namibia.
710	The defence pact allowed Angolan troops to use Namibian territory when attacking Jonas Savimbi's UNITA.
710	Nigeria Angolan-Nigerian relations are primarily based on their roles as oil exporting nations.
710	Both are members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, the African Union and other multilateral organizations.
710	South Africa Angola-South Africa relations are quite strong as the ruling parties in both nations, the African National Congress in South Africa and the MPLA in Angola, fought together during the Angolan Civil War and South African Border War.
710	They fought against UNITA rebels, based in Angola, and the apartheid-era government in South Africa who supported them.
710	Nelson Mandela mediated between the MPLA and UNITA factions during the last years of Angola's civil war.
710	Zimbabwe Angola-Zimbabwe relations have remained cordial since the birth of both states, Angola in 1975 and Zimbabwe in 1979, during the Cold War.
710	While Angola's foreign policy shifted to a pro-U.S.
710	President Robert Mugabe Zimbabwe's ties with the West soured in the late 1990s.
710	Guinea-Bissau Following a request by the government of Guinea-Bissau, Angola sent there a contingent of about 300 troops meant to help putting an end to the political-military unrest in that country, and to reorganize the local military forces.
710	In fact, these troops were perceived as a kinf of Pretorian Guard for the ruling party, PAIGC.
710	In the beginning of April 2012, when a new military Coup d'état was under preparation, the Angolan regime decided to withdraw its military mission from Guinea-Bissau.

711	Albert Sidney Johnston (February 2, 1803 – April 6, 1862) served as a general in three different armies: the Texas Army, the United States Army, and the Confederate States Army.
711	He saw extensive combat during his military career, fighting actions in the Texas War of Independence, the Mexican-American War, the Utah War, and the American Civil War.
711	Considered by Confederate President Jefferson Davis to be the finest (and the second-highest ranking) general officer in the Confederacy before the emergence of Robert E.
711	Lee, he was killed early in the Civil War at the Battle of Shiloh and was the highest-ranking officer, Union or Confederate, killed during the entire war.
711	Davis believed the loss of Johnston "was the turning point of our fate".
711	Early life Johnston was born in Washington, Kentucky, the youngest son of Dr.
711	John and Abigail Harris Johnston.
711	His father was a native of Salisbury, Connecticut.
711	Although Albert Johnston was born in Kentucky, he lived much of his life in Texas, which he considered his home.
711	He was first educated at Transylvania University in Lexington, where he met fellow student Jefferson Davis.
711	Both were appointed to the United States Military Academy, Davis two years behind Johnston.
711	In 1826 Johnston graduated eighth of 41 cadets in his class from West Point with a commission as a brevet second lieutenant in the 2nd U.S.
711	Infantry.
711	Johnston was assigned to posts in New York and Missouri and served in the Black Hawk War in 1832 as chief of staff to Bvt.
711	Brig.
711	Gen.
711	Henry Atkinson.
711	In 1829 he married Henrietta Preston, sister of Kentucky politician and future civil war general William Preston.
711	He resigned his commission in 1834 to return to Kentucky to care for his dying wife, who succumbed two years later to tuberculosis.
711	They had one son, Col.
711	William Preston Johnston, who would also serve in the Confederate Army.
711	Texas Army In April 1834, Johnston took up farming in Texas and enlisted as a private in the Texas Army during the Texas War of Independence against the Republic of Mexico in 1836.
711	One month later, Johnston was promoted to major and the position of aide-de-camp to General Sam Houston.
711	He was named Adjutant General as a colonel in the Republic of Texas Army on August 5, 1836.
711	On January 31, 1837, he became senior brigadier general in command of the Texas Army.
711	On February 7, 1837, he fought in a duel with Texas Brig.
711	Gen.
711	Felix Huston, challenging each other for the command of the Texas Army; Johnston refused to fire on Huston and lost the position after he was wounded in the pelvis.
711	The second president of the Republic of Texas, Mirabeau B.
711	Lamar, appointed him Secretary of War on December 22, 1838.
711	Johnston was to provide the defense of the Texas border against Mexican invasion, and in 1839 conducted a campaign against Indians in northern Texas.
711	In February 1840, he resigned and returned to Kentucky, where he married Eliza Griffin in 1843.
711	They settled on a large plantation he named China Grove in Brazoria County, Texas.
711	U.S.
711	Army Johnston returned to the Texas Army during the Mexican-American War under General Zachary Taylor as a colonel of the 1st Texas Rifle Volunteers.
711	The enlistments of his volunteers ran out just before the Battle of Monterrey.
711	Johnston managed to convince a few volunteers to stay and fight as he himself served as the inspector general of volunteers and fought at the battles of Monterrey and Buena Vista.
711	Johnston remained on his plantation after the war until he was appointed by President Taylor to the U.S.
711	Army as a major and was made a paymaster in December 1849.
711	He served in that role for more than five years, making six tours, and traveling more than 4000 mi annually on the Indian frontier of Texas.
711	He served on the Texas frontier at Fort Mason and elsewhere in the West.
711	In 1855 President Franklin Pierce appointed him colonel of the new 2nd U.S.
711	Cavalry (the unit that preceded the modern 5th U.S.), a new regiment, which he organized.
711	As a key figure in the Utah War, he led U.S.
711	Mormon government in the formerly Mormon territory.
711	He received a brevet promotion to brigadier general in 1857 for his service in Utah.
711	He spent 1860 in Kentucky until December 21, when he sailed for California to take command of the Department of the Pacific.
711	Civil War At the outbreak of the Civil War, Johnston was the commander of the U.S.
711	Army Department of the Pacific in California.
711	Like many regular army officers from the South he was opposed to secession, but resigned his commission soon after he heard of the secession of his adopted state Texas.
711	It was accepted by the War Department on May 6, 1861, effective May 3.
711	On April 28 he moved to Los Angeles where he had family and remained there until May when, suspected by local Union authorities, he evaded arrest and joined the Los Angeles Mounted Rifles as a private, leaving Warner's Ranch May 27.
711	He participated in their trek across the southwestern deserts to Texas, crossing the Colorado River into the Confederate Territory of Arizona on July 4, 1861.
711	Early in the Civil War, Confederate President Jefferson Davis decided that the Confederacy would attempt to hold as much of its territory as possible and he distributed its military forces around its borders and coasts.
711	In the summer of 1861, Davis appointed several generals to defend Confederate lines from the Mississippi River east to the Allegheny Mountains.
711	Maj.
711	Gen.
711	Leonidas Polk and Brig.
711	Gen.
711	Gideon J.
711	Pillow, who had been initially in command in Tennessee as that State's top general.
711	Their impolitic occupation of Columbus, Kentucky on September 3, 1861, two days before Johnston arrived in the Confederacy's capital, Richmond, Virginia, after his cross–country journey, drove Kentucky from its stated neutrality and the majority of Kentuckians into the Union camp.
711	Their action gave Union Brig.
711	Gen.
711	Ulysses S.
711	Grant an excuse to take control of the even more important and strategically located town of Paducah, Kentucky without raising the ire of most Kentuckians and the pro-Union majority in the State legislature.
711	Confederate command in Western Theater On September 10, 1861, Johnston was assigned to command the huge area of the Confederacy west of the Allegheny Mountains, except for coastal areas.
711	He became commander of the Confederacy's western armies in the area often called the Western Department or Western Military Department.
711	After his appointment, Johnston immediately headed for his new territory.
711	He was permitted to call on governors of Arkansas, Tennessee and Mississippi for new troops, although this authority was largely stifled by politics, especially with respect to Mississippi.
711	On September 13, 1861, in view of the decision of the Kentucky legislature to side with the Union after the occupation of Columbus by Polk, Johnston ordered Brig.
711	Gen.
711	Felix Zollicoffer with 4,000 men to occupy Cumberland Gap in Kentucky in order to block Union troops from coming into eastern Tennessee.
711	By September 18, Johnston had Brig.
711	Gen.
711	Simon Bolivar Buckner with another 4,000 men blocking the railroad route to Tennessee at Bowling Green, Kentucky.
711	Johnston had less than 40,000 men spread throughout Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas and Missouri.
711	Of these, 10,000 were in Missouri under Missouri State Guard Maj.
711	Gen.
711	Sterling Price.
711	Johnston's initial call upon the governors for more men did not result in many immediate recruits but Johnston had another, even bigger, problem since his force was seriously short of arms and ammunition even for the troops he had.
711	As the Confederate government concentrated efforts on the units in the East, they gave Johnston only small numbers of reinforcements and minimal amounts of arms and material.
711	Johnston could only keep up his defense by raids and other measures to make it appear he had larger forces than he did, a strategy that worked for several months.
711	Johnston's tactics had so annoyed and confused Union Brig.
711	Gen.
711	William Tecumseh Sherman that he became somewhat unnerved, overestimated Johnston's forces, and had to be relieved by Brig.
711	Gen.
711	Don Carlos Buell on November 9, 1861.
711	Battle of Mill Springs Eastern Tennessee was held for the Confederacy by two unimpressive brigadier generals appointed by Jefferson Davis, Felix Zollicoffer, a brave but untrained and inexperienced officer, and soon to be Maj.
711	Gen.
711	George B.
711	Crittenden, a former U.S.
711	Army officer with apparent alcohol problems.
711	While Crittenden was away in Richmond, Zollicoffer moved his forces to the north bank of the upper Cumberland River near Mill Springs (now Nancy, Kentucky), putting the river to his back and his forces into a trap.
711	Zollicoffer decided it was impossible to obey orders to return to the other side of the river because of scarcity of transport and proximity of Union troops.
711	When Union Brig.
711	Gen.
711	George H.
711	Thomas moved against the Confederates, Crittenden decided to attack one of the two parts of Thomas's command at Logan's Cross Roads near Mill Springs before the Union forces could unite.
711	On January 19, 1862, the ill-prepared Confederates, after a night march in the rain, attacked the Union force with some initial success.
711	As the battle progressed, Zollicoffer was killed, Crittenden was unable to lead the Confederate force since he was probably intoxicated and the Confederates were turned back and routed by a Union bayonet charge, suffering 533 casualties from their force of 4,000.
711	The Confederate troops who escaped were assigned to other units as Crittenden faced an investigation of his conduct.
711	After this Confederate defeat at the Battle of Mill Springs, Davis sent Johnston a brigade and a few other scattered reinforcements, and he sent Gen.
711	P.G.T.
711	Beauregard, who was supposed to attract recruits because of his victories early in the war and give Johnston a competent subordinate.
711	The brigade, however, came with the incompetent Brig.
711	Gen.
711	John B.
711	Floyd, who was to take command at Fort Donelson as the senior general present just before Brig.
711	Gen.
711	Grant attacked the fort.
711	Beauregard's move to the west contributed to the movement of the Union commanders into action against the forts so they could act before, in their view, Beauregard could make a difference in the theater.
711	They had heard that he was bringing 15 regiments with him, but this actually was not true.
711	Fort Henry, Fort Donelson, Nashville Based on the assumption that Kentucky neutrality would act as a shield against a direct invasion from the north, Tennessee initially had sent men to Virginia and concentrated defenses in the Mississippi Valley, circumstances that no longer applied in September 1861.
711	Even before Johnston arrived in Tennessee, two forts had been started to defend the Tennessee River and the Cumberland River which provided avenues into the State from the north.
711	Both had been sited in Tennessee, however, in order to respect Kentucky neutrality and were not in ideal locations.
711	Fort Henry on the Tennessee River was in an especially unfavorable low–lying location commanded by hills on the Kentucky side of the river.
711	Fort Donelson on the Cumberland River, although in a better location, also was not well–sited, had a vulnerable land side and did not have enough heavy artillery for its defense against gunboats.
711	Maj.
711	Gen.
711	Polk ignored the problems of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson when he took command and, after Johnston took command, at first refused to comply with Johnston's order to send an engineer, Lt.
711	Joseph K.
711	Dixon, to inspect the forts.
711	After Johnston asserted his authority, Polk ultimately had to allow Dixon to proceed.
711	Dixon recommended that the forts be maintained and strengthened, even though they were not in ideal locations, because much work had been done on them and the Confederates might not have time to build new ones.
711	Johnston accepted the recommendations.
711	Johnston wanted Major, later Lt.
711	Gen., Alexander P.
711	Stewart to command the forts but President Davis appointed Brig.
711	Gen.
711	Lloyd Tilghman as commander.
711	Then, in order to prevent Polk from dissipating his forces by implementing his proposal to allow some men to join a partisan group, Johnston ordered him to send Brig.
711	Gen.
711	Gideon Pillow and 5,000 men to Fort Donelson.
711	Pillow took up a position at nearby Clarksville, Tennessee and did not move into the fort itself until February 7, 1862.
711	Alerted by a Union reconnaissance on January 14, 1862, Johnston ordered Tilghman to fortify the high ground opposite Fort Henry, which Polk had failed to do despite Johnston's orders.
711	Tilghman also failed to act decisively on these orders, which in any event were now too late to be adequately carried out.
711	Gen.
711	Beauregard arrived at Johnston's headquarters at Bowling Green on February 4, 1862 and was given overall command of Polk's force at the western end of Johnston's line at Columbus, Kentucky.
711	On February 6, 1862, Union Navy gunboats quickly reduced the defenses of ill-sited Fort Henry, inflicting 21 casualties on the small remaining Confederate force.
711	Brig.
711	Gen.
711	Lloyd Tilghman surrendered the 94 remaining officers and men of his approximately 3,000-man force which had not been sent to Fort Donelson before U.S.
711	Grant's force could even take up their positions.
711	Johnston knew he could be trapped at Bowling Green if Fort Donelson fell, so he moved his force to Nashville, the capital of Tennessee and an increasingly important Confederate industrial center, beginning on February 11, 1862.
711	Johnston also reinforced Fort Donelson with 12,000 more men, including those under Floyd and Pillow, a curious decision in view of his thought that the Union gunboats alone might be able to take the fort.
711	He did order the commanders of the fort to evacuate the troops if the fort could not be held.
711	The senior generals sent to the fort to command the enlarged garrison, Gideon J.
711	Pillow and John B.
711	Floyd, squandered their chance to avoid having to surrender most of the garrison and on February 16, 1862, Brig.
711	Gen.
711	Simon Buckner, having been abandoned by Floyd and  Pillow, surrendered Fort Donelson.
711	Colonel Nathan Bedford Forrest escaped with his cavalry force of about 700 men before the surrender.
711	The Confederates suffered about 1,500 casualties with an estimated 12,000 to 14,000 taken prisoner.
711	Union casualties were 500 killed, 2,108 wounded, 224 missing.
711	Johnston, who had little choice in allowing Floyd and Pillow to take charge at Fort Donelson on the basis of seniority after he ordered them to add their forces to the garrison, took the blame and suffered calls for his removal because a full explanation to the press and public would have exposed the weakness of the Confederate position.
711	His passive defensive performance while positioning himself in a forward position at Bowling Green, spreading his forces too thinly, not concentrating his forces in the face of Union advances, and appointing or relying upon inadequate or incompetent subordinates subjected him to criticism at the time and by later historians.
711	The fall of the forts exposed Nashville to imminent attack, and it fell without resistance to Union forces under Brig.
711	Gen.
711	Buell on February 25, 1862, two days after Johnston had to pull his forces out in order to avoid having them captured as well.
711	Concentration at Corinth Johnston had various remaining military units scattered throughout his territorration ay and retreating to the south to avoid being cut off.
711	Johnston himself retreated with the force under his personal command, the Army of Central Kentucky, from the vicinity of Nashville.
711	With Beauregard's help, Johnston decided to concentrate forces with those formerly under Polk and now already under Beauregard's command at the strategically located railroad crossroads of Corinth, Mississippi, which he reached by a circuitous route.
711	Johnston kept the Union forces, now under the overall command of the ponderous Maj.
711	Gen.
711	Henry Halleck, confused and hesitant to move, allowing Johnston to reach his objective undetected.
711	This delay allowed Jefferson Davis finally to send reinforcements from the garrisons of coastal cities and another highly rated but prickly general, Braxton Bragg, to help organize the western forces.
711	Bragg at least calmed the nerves of Beauregard and Polk who had become agitated by their apparent dire situation in the face of numerically superior forces before the arrival of Johnston on March 24, 1862.
711	Johnston's army of 17,000 men gave the Confederates a combined force of about 40,000 to 44,669 men at Corinth.
711	On March 29, 1862, Johnston officially took command of this combined force, which continued to use the Army of the Mississippi name under which it had been organized by Beauregard on March 5.
711	Johnston now planned to defeat the Union forces piecemeal before the various Union units in Kentucky and Tennessee under Grant with 40,000 men at nearby Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee, and the now Maj.
711	Gen.
711	Don Carlos Buell on his way from Nashville with 35,000 men, could unite against him.
711	Johnston started his army in motion on April 3, 1862, intent on surprising Grant's force as soon as the next day, but they moved slowly due to their inexperience, bad roads and lack of adequate staff planning.
711	Johnston's army was finally in position within a mile or two of Grant's force, and undetected, by the evening of April 5, 1862.
711	Battle of Shiloh and death Johnston launched a massive surprise attack with his concentrated forces against Grant at the Battle of Shiloh on April 6, 1862.
711	As the Confederate forces overran the Union camps, Johnston seemed to be everywhere, personally leading and rallying troops up and down the line on his horse.
711	At about 2:30 p.m., while leading one of those charges against a Union camp near the "Peach Orchard", he was wounded, taking a bullet behind his right knee.
711	He apparently did not think the wound was serious at the time, and so he sent his personal physician to attend to some wounded captured Union soldiers instead.
711	It is possible that Johnston's duel in 1837 had caused nerve damage or numbness to his right leg and that he did not feel the wound to his leg as a result.
711	The bullet had in fact clipped a part of his popliteal artery and his boot was filling up with blood.
711	Within a few minutes, Johnston was observed by his staff to be nearly fainting off his horse.
711	Among his staff was Isham G.
711	Harris, the Governor of Tennessee, who had ceased to make any real effort to function as governor after learning that Abraham Lincoln had appointed Andrew Johnson as military governor of Tennessee.
711	Seeing Johnston slumping in his saddle and his face turning deathly pale, Harris asked: "General, are you wounded?"
711	Johnston glanced down at his leg wound, then faced Harris and replied with his last words: "Yes, and I fear seriously."
711	Harris and other staff officers removed Johnston from his horse and carried him to a small ravine near the "Hornets Nest" and desperately tried to aid the general by trying to make a tourniquet for his leg wound, but little could be done by this point since he had already lost so much blood.
711	He soon lost consciousness and bled to death a few minutes later.
711	Harris and the other officers wrapped General Johnston's body in a blanket so as not to damage the troops' morale with the sight of the dead general.
711	Johnston and his wounded horse, named Fire Eater, were taken to his field headquarters on the Corinth road, where his body remained in his tent until the Confederate Army withdrew to Corinth the next day, April 7, 1862.
711	From there, his body was taken to the home of Colonel William Inge, which had been his headquarters in Corinth.
711	It was covered in the Confederate flag and laid in state for several hours.
711	It is probable that a Confederate soldier fired the fatal round.
711	No Union soldiers were observed to have ever gotten behind Johnston during the fatal charge, while it is known that many Confederates were firing at the Union lines while Johnston charged well in advance of his soldiers.
711	Johnston was the highest-ranking casualty of the war on either side, and his death was a strong blow to the morale of the Confederacy.
711	Jefferson Davis considered him the bestis death general in the country; this was two months before the emergence of Robert E.
711	Lee as the pre-eminent general of the Confederacy.
711	Epitaph Johnston was initially buried in New Orleans.
711	In 1866, a joint resolution of the Texas Legislature was passed to have his body reinterred to the Texas State Cemetery in Austin The re-interment occurred in 1867.
711	Forty years later, the state appointed Elisabet Ney to design a monument and sculpture of him to be erected at his gravesite.
711	The Texas Historical Commission has erected a historical marker near the entrance of what was once his plantation.
711	An adjacent marker was erected by the San Jacinto Chapter of the Daughters of The Republic of Texas and the Lee, Roberts, and Davis Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederate States of America.
711	The University of Texas at Austin has also recognized Johnston with a statue on the South Mall.
713	An android is a robot or synthetic organism designed to look and act like a human, especially one with a body having a flesh-like resemblance.
713	Until recently, androids have largely remained within the domain of science fiction, frequently seen in film and television.
713	However, advancements in robotic technology have allowed the design of functional and realistic humanoid robots.
713	Etymology The word was coined from the Greek root ἀνδρ- 'man' and the suffix -oid 'having the form or likeness of'.
713	The term "droid", coined by George Lucas for the original Star Wars film and now used widely within science fiction, originated as an abridgment of "android", but has been used by Lucas and others to mean any robot, including distinctly non-human form machines like R2-D2.
713	The word "android" was used in Star Trek: The Original Series episode What Are Little Girls Made Of?
713	The abbreviation "andy", coined as a pejorative by writer Philip K.
713	Dick in his novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, has seen some further usage, such as within the TV series Total Recall 2070.
713	The Oxford English Dictionary traces the earliest use (as "Androides") to Ephraim Chambers' Cyclopaedia, in reference to an automaton that St.
713	Albertus Magnus allegedly created.
713	The term "android" appears in US patents as early as 1863 in reference to miniature human-like toy automatons.
713	The term android was used in a more modern sense by the French author Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam in his work Tomorrow's Eve (1886).
713	This story features an artificial humanlike robot named Hadaly.
713	As said by the officer in the story, "In this age of Realien advancement, who knows what goes on in the mind of those responsible for these mechanical dolls."
713	The term made an impact into English pulp science fiction starting from Jack Williamson's The Cometeers (1936) and the distinction between mechanical robots and fleshy androids was popularized by Edmond Hamilton's Captain Future (1940–1944).
713	Although Karel Čapek's robots in R.U.R.
713	Rossum's Universal Robots) (1921) – the play that introduced the word robot to the world – were organic artificial humans, the word "robot" has come to primarily refer to mechanical humans, animals, and other beings.
713	The term "android" can mean either one of these, while a cyborg ("cybernetic organism" or "bionic man") would be a creature that is a combination of organic and mechanical parts.
713	Authors have used the term android in more diverse ways than robot or cyborg.
713	In some fictional works, the difference between a robot and android is only their appearance, with androids being made to look like humans on the outside but with robot-like internal mechanics.
713	In other stories, authors have used the word "android" to mean a wholly organic, yet artificial, creation.
713	Other fictional depictions of androids fall somewhere in between.
713	Eric G.
713	Wilson, who defines androids as a "synthetic human being", distinguishes between three types of androids, based on their body's composition: * the mummy type - where androids are made of "dead things" or "stiff, inanimate, natural material", such as mummies, puppets, dolls and statues * the golem type - androids made from flexible, possibly organic material, including golems and homunculi * the automaton type - androids which are a mix of dead and living parts, including automatons and robots Although human morphology is not necessarily the ideal form for working robots, the fascination in developing robots that can mimic it can be found historically in the assimilation of two concepts: simulacra (devices that exhibit likeness) and automata (devices that have independence).

713	DER 2 android.
713	The height of the human body part of DER2 is 165 cm.
713	There are 47 mobile points.
713	DER2 can not only change its expression but also move its hands and feet and twist its body.
713	The "air servosystem" which Kokoro Co.
713	As a result of having an actuator controlled precisely with air pressure via a servosystem, the movement is very fluid and there is very little noise.
713	DER2 realized a slimmer body than that of the former version by using a smaller cylinder.
713	Outwardly DER2 has a more beautiful proportion.
713	Compared to the previous model, DER2 has thinner arms and a wider repertoire of expressions.
713	Once programmed, it is able to choreograph its motions and gestures with its voice.
713	The Intelligent Mechatronics Lab, directed by Hiroshi Kobayashi at the Tokyo University of Science, has developed an android head called Saya, which was exhibited at Robodex 2002 in Yokohama, Japan.
713	There are several other initiatives around the world involving humanoid research and development at this time, which will hopefulatives around the world involy introduce a broader spectrum of realized technology in the near future.
713	Now Saya is working at the Science University of Tokyo as a guide.
713	The Waseda University (Japan) and NTT Docomo's manufacturers have succeeded in creating a shape-shifting robot WD-2.
713	It is capable of changing its face.
713	At first, the creators decided the positions of the necessary points to express the outline, eyes, nose, and so on of a certain person.
713	The robot expresses its face by moving all points to the decided positions, they say.
713	The first version of the robot was first developed back in 2003.
713	After that, a year later, they made a couple of major improvements to the design.
713	The robot features an elastic mask made from the average head dummy.
713	It uses a driving system with a 3DOF unit.
713	The WD-2 robot can change its facial features by activating specific facial points on a mask, with each point possessing three degrees of freedom.
713	This one has 17 facial points, for a total of 56 degrees of freedom.
713	As for the materials they used, the WD-2's mask is fabricated with a highly elastic material called Septom, with bits of steel wool mixed in for added strength.
713	Other technical features reveal a shaft driven behind the mask at the desired facial point, driven by a DC motor with a simple pulley and a slide screw.
713	Apparently, the researchers can also modify the shape of the mask based on actual human faces.
713	To "copy" a face, they need only a 3D scanner to determine the locations of an individual's 17 facial points.
713	After that, they are then driven into position using a laptop and 56 motor control boards.
713	In addition, the researchers also mention that the shifting robot can even display an individual's hair style and skin color if a photo of their face is projected onto the 3D Mask.
713	Korea KITECH researched and developed EveR-1, an android interpersonal communications model capable of emulating human emotional expression via facial "musculature" and capable of rudimentary conversation, having a vocabulary of around 400 words.
713	She is  tall and weighs , matching the average figure of a Korean women in her twenties.
713	EveR-1's name derives from the Biblical Eve, plus the letter r for robot.
713	EveR-1's advanced computing processing power enables speech recognition and vocal synthesis, at the same time processing lip synchronization and visual recognition by 90-degree micro-CCD cameras with face recognition technology.
713	An independent microchip inside her artificial brain handles gesture expression, body coordination, and emotion expression.
713	Her whole body is made of highly advanced synthetic jelly silicon and with 60 artificial joints in her face, neck, and lower body; she is able to demonstrate realistic facial expressions and sing while simultaneously dancing.
713	In South Korea, the Ministry of Information and Communication  has an ambitious plan to put a robot in every household by 2020.
713	Several robot cities have been planned for the country: the first will be built in 2009 at a cost of 500 billion won, of which 50 billion is direct government investment.
713	The new robot city will feature research and development centers for manufacturers and part suppliers, as well as exhibition halls and a stadium for robot competitions.
713	The country's new Robotics Ethics Charter will establish ground rules and laws for human interaction with robots in the future, setting standards for robotics users and manufacturers, as well as guidelines on ethical standards to be programmed into robots to prevent human abuse of robots and vice versa.

713	This Einstein android, also called "Albert Hubo", thus represents the first full-body walking android in history (see video at ).
713	Hanson Robotics, the FedEx Institute of Technology, and the University of Texas at Arlington also developed the android portrait of sci-fi author Philip K.
713	Dick (creator of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, the basis for the film Blade Runner), with full conversational capabilities that incorporated thousands of pages of the author's works.
713	In 2005, the PKD android won a first place artificial intelligence award from AAAI.
713	United Kingdom In 2001, Steve Grand OBE, creator of the computer game, Creatures, created an android, or anthropoid, he named Lucy.
713	The intention was that she would have to learn everything, including how to use her mechanical vocal chords to speak.
713	Her systems were made to be similar to a human's.
713	Use in fiction Androids are a staple of science fiction.
713	Isaac Asimov pioneered the fictionalization of the science of robotics and artificial intelligence, notably in his 1950s series I, Robot and Foundation and Empire.
713	One thing common to most fictional androids is that the real-life technological challenges associated with creating thoroughly human-like robots – such as the creation of strong artificial intelligence – are assumed to have been solved.
713	Fictional androids are often depicted as mentally and physically equal or superior to humans – moving, thinking and speaking as fluidly as them.
713	The tension between the nonhuman substance and the human appearance – or even human ambitions – of androids is the dramatic impetus behind most of their fictional depictions.
713	Some android heroes seek, like Pinocchio, to becomgt; or Data in Star Trek: The Next Generation.
713	Others, as in the film Westworld, rebel against abuse by careless humans.
713	Android hunter Deckard in Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?
713	Blade Runner discovers that his targets are, in some ways, more human than he is.
713	Android stories, therefore, are not essentially stories "about" androids; they are stories about the human condition and what it means to be human.
713	One aspect of writing about the meaning of humanity is to use discrimination against androids as a mechanism for exploring racism in society, as in Blade Runner.
713	Perhaps the clearest example of this is John Brunner's 1968 novel Into the Slave Nebula, where the blue-skinned android slaves are explicitly shown to be fully human.
713	More recently, the androids Bishop and Annalee Call in the films Aliens and Alien Resurrection are used as vehicles for exploring how humans deal with the presence of an "Other".
713	Female androids, or "gynoids", are often seen in science fiction, and can be viewed as a continuation of the long tradition of men attempting to create the stereotypical "perfect woman".
713	Examples include the Greek myth of Pygmalion and the female robot Maria in Fritz Lang's Metropolis.
713	Some gynoids, like Pris in Blade Runner, are designed as sex-objects, with the intent of "pleasing men's violent sexual desires," or as submissive, servile companions, such as in The Stepford Wives.
713	Fiction about gynoids has therefore been described as reinforcing "essentialist ideas of femininity", although others have suggested that the treatment of androids is a way of exploring racism and misogyny in society.
717	Alberta is a province of Canada.
717	It had a population of 3,645,257 in 2011, making it the most populous of Canada's three prairie provinces.
717	Alberta and its neighbour, Saskatchewan, were established as provinces on September 1, 1905.
717	Alberta is located in western Canada, bounded by the provinces of British Columbia to the west and Saskatchewan to the east, the Northwest Territories to the north, and the U.S.
717	Montana to the south.
717	Alberta is one of three Canadian provinces and territories to border only a single U.S.
717	Edmonton, the capital city of Alberta, is located near the geographic centre of the province and is the primary supply and service hub for Canada's oil sands and other northern resource industries.
717	Approximately 300 km south of the capital is Calgary, Alberta's largest city and a major distribution and transportation hub.
717	Calgary and Edmonton centre Alberta's two census metropolitan areas, both of which have populations exceeding 1 million, while the province has 16 census agglomerations.
717	Notable tourist destinations in the province include Banff, Canmore, Drumheller, Jasper and Sylvan Lake.
717	The current Premier of the province is Alison Redford.
717	Etymology Alberta is named after Princess Louise Caroline Alberta (1848–1939), the fourth daughter of Victoria, the Queen of Canada until 1901, and Albert, Prince Consort.
717	Princess Louise was the wife of the Marquess of Lorne, Governor General of Canada from 1878 to 1883.
717	Lake Louise and Mount Alberta were also named in honour of Princess Louise.
717	Geography  Alberta, with an area of 661848 km2 is the fourth largest province after Quebec, Ontario, and British Columbia.
717	To the south, the province borders on the 49th parallel north, separating it from the U.S.
717	Montana, while on the north the 60th parallel north divides it from the Northwest Territories.
717	To the east the 110th meridian west separates it from the province of Saskatchewan, while on the west its boundary with British Columbia follows the 120th meridian west south from the Northwest Territories at 60°N until it reaches the Continental Divide at the Rocky Mountains, and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the Continental Divide in a generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the Montana border at 49°N.
717	The province extends 1223 km north to south and 660 km east to west at its maximum width.
717	Its highest point is 3747 m at the summit of Mount Columbia in the Rocky Mountains along the southwest border, while its lowest point is 152 m on the Slave River in Wood Buffalo National Park in the northeast.
717	With the exception of the semi-arid steppe of the southeastern section, the province has adequate water resources.
717	There are numerous rivers and lakes used for swimming, fishing and a range of water sports.
717	There are three large lakes, Lake Claire (1436 km2) in Wood Buffalo National Park, Lesser Slave Lake (1168 km2), and Lake Athabasca (7898 km2) which lies in both Alberta and Saskatchewan.
717	The longest river in the province is the Athabasca River which travels 1538 km from the Columbia Icefield in the Rocky Mountains to Lake Athabasca.
717	The largest river is the Peace River with an average flow of 2161 m3/s.
717	The Peace River originates in the Rocky Mountains of northern British Columbia and flows through northern Alberta and into the Slave River, a tributary of the Mackenzie River.
717	Alberta's capital city, Edmonton, is located approximately in the geographic centre ol Park Albertaf the province.
717	It is the most northerly major city in Canada, and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern Canada.
717	The region, with its proximity to Canada's largest oil fields, has most of western Canada's oil refinery capacity.
717	Calgary is located approximately 280 km south of Edmonton and 240 km north of Montana, surrounded by extensive ranching country.
717	Almost 75% of the province's population lives in the Calgary–Edmonton Corridor.
717	Most of the northern half of the province is boreal forest, while the Rocky Mountains along the southwestern boundary are largely forested (see Alberta Mountain forests and Alberta-British Columbia foothills forests).
717	The southern quarter of the province is prairie, ranging from shortgrass prairie in the southeastern corner to mixed grass prairie in an arc to the west and north of it.
717	The central aspen parkland region extending in a broad arc between the prairies and the forests, from Calgary, north to Edmonton, and then east to Lloydminster, contains the most fertile soil in the province and most of the population.
717	Much of the unforested part of Alberta is given over either to grain or to dairy farming, with mixed farming more common in the north and centre, while ranching and irrigated agriculture predominate in the south.
717	The Alberta badlands are located in southeastern Alberta, where the Red Deer River crosses the flat prairie and farmland, and features deep canyons and striking landforms.
717	Dinosaur Provincial Park, near Brooks, Alberta, showcases the badlands terrain, desert flora, and remnants from Alberta's past when dinosaurs roamed the then lush landscape.
717	Climate  Alberta has a dry continental climate with warm summers and cold winters.
717	The province is open to cold arctic weather systems from the north, which often produce extremely cold conditions in winter.
717	As the fronts between the air masses shift north and south across Alberta, the temperature can change rapidly.
717	Arctic air masses in the winter produce extreme minimum temperatures varying from  in northern Alberta to  in southern Alberta.
717	In the summer, continental air masses produce maximum temperatures from 32 C in the mountains to 40 C in southern Alberta.
717	Alberta extends for over 1200 km from north to south; its climate, therefore, varies considerably.
717	Average high temperatures in January range from 0 C in the southwest to  in the far north.
717	The climate is also influenced by the presence of the Rocky Mountains to the southwest, which disrupt the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province, casting a rain shadow over much of Alberta.
717	The northerly location and isolation from the weather systems of the Pacific Ocean cause Alberta to have a dry climate with little moderation from the ocean.
717	Annual precipitation ranges from 300 mm in the southeast to 450 mm in the north, except in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains where total precipitation including snowfall can reach 600 mm annually.
717	The province is the namesake of the Alberta clipper, a type of intense, fast-moving winter storm that generally forms over or near the province and descends with great speed over the rest of Canada and the northern United States.
717	In the summer, the average daytime temperatures range from around 21 C in the Rocky Mountain valleys and far north, up to around 28 C in the dry prairie of the southeast.
717	The northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures.
717	The south and east-central portions are prone to drought-like conditions sometimes persisting for several years, although even these areas can receive heavy precipitation.
717	Alberta is a sunny province.
717	Annual bright sunshine totals range between 1900 up to just under 2600 hours per year.
717	Northern Alberta gets about 18 hours of daylight in the summer.
717	In southwestern Alberta, the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm, dry chinook winds blowing from the mountains, which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to well above the freezing point in a very short period.
717	During one chinook recorded at Pincher Creek, temperatures soared from  in just one hour.
717	The region around Lethbridge has the most chinooks, averaging 30 to 35 chinook days per year.
717	Calgary has a 56% chance of a white Christmas, while Edmonton has an 86% chance.
717	Northern Alberta is mostly covered by boreal forest and has a subarctic climate.
717	The agricultural area of southern Alberta have a semi-arid steppe climate because the annual precipitation is less than the water that evaporates or is used by plants.
717	The southeastern corner of Alberta, part of the Palliser Triangle, experiences greater summer heat and lower rainfall than the rest of the province, and as a result suffers frequent crop yield problems and occasional severe droughts.
717	Western Alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by winter chinook winds.
717	Central and parts of northwestern Alberta in the Peace River region are largely aspen parkland, a biome transitional between prairie to the south and boreal forest to the north.
717	After Southern Ontario, Central Alberta is the most likely region in Canada to experience tornadoes.
717	Thunderstorms, some of them severe, are frequent in the summer, especially in central and southern Alberta.
717	The region surrounding the Calgary–Edmonton Corridor is notable for having the highest frequency of hail in Canada, which is caused by orographic lifting from the nearby Rocky Mountains, enhancing the updraft/downdraft cycle necessary for the formation of hail.
717	Ecology  Flora  In central and northern Alberta the arrival of spring brings the prairie crocus anemone, the three flowered avens, golden bean, wild rose and other early flowers.
717	The advancing summer introduces many flowers of the sunflower family.
717	The southern and east central parts of Alberta are covered by a short, prairie grass, which dries up as summer lengthens, to be replaced by hardy perennials such as the prairie coneflower, fleabane, and sage.
717	Both yellow and white sweet clover can be found throughout the southern and central areas of the province.
717	The trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides.
717	These are largely deciduous, typically aspen, poplar, and willow.
717	Many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain.
717	On the north side of the North Saskatchewan River evergreen forests prevail for thousands of square kilometres.
717	Aspen poplar, balsam poplar (or cottonwood), and paper birch are the primary large deciduous species.
717	Conifers include Jack pine, Rocky Mountain pine, Lodgepole pine, both white and black spruce, and the deciduous conifer tamarack.
717	Fauna  The four climatic regions (alpine, boreal forest, parkland, and prairie) of Alberta are home to many different species of animals.
717	The south and central prairie was the land of the bison, commonly known as buffalo, its grasses providing pasture and breeding ground for millions of buffalo.
717	The buffalo population was decimated during early settlement, but since then buffalo have made a comeback, living on farms and in parks all over Alberta.
717	Alberta is home to many large carnivores.
717	Among them are the grizzly and black bears, which are found in the mountains and wooded regions.
717	Smaller carnivores of the canine and feline families include coyotes, wolves, fox, lynx, bobcat and mountain lion (cougar).
717	Herbivorous animals are found throughout the province.
717	Moose, mule deer, elk, and white-tail deer are found in the wooded regions, and pronghorn can be found in the prairies of southern Alberta.
717	Bighorn sheep and mountain goats live in the Rocky Mountains.
717	Rabbits, porcupines, skunks, squirrels and many species of rodents and reptiles live in every corner of the province.
717	Alberta is home to only one variety of venomous snake, the prairie rattlesnake.
717	Central and northern Alberta and the region farther north is the nesting ground of many migratory birds.
717	Vast numbers of ducks, geese, swans and pelicans arrive in Alberta every spring and nest on or near one of the hundreds of small lakes that dot northern Alberta.
717	Eagles, hawks, owls and crows are plentiful, and a huge variety of smaller seed and insect-eating birds can be found.
717	Alberta, like other temperate regions, is home to mosquitoes, flies, wasps, and bees.
717	Rivers and lakes are populated with pike, walleye, whitefish, rainbow, speckled, and brown trout, and even sturgeon.
717	Bull Trout, native to the province, is the Alberta's provincial fish.
717	Turtles are found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province.
717	Frogs and salamanders are a few of the amphibians that make their homes in Alberta.
717	Alberta is the only province in Canada—as well as one of the few places in the world—that is free of Norwegian rats.
717	Since the early 1950s, the government of Alberta has operated a rat-control program, which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported, usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail.
717	In 2006, Alberta Agriculture reports zero findings of wild rats; the only rat interceptions have been domesticated rats that have been seized from their owners.
717	It is illegal for individual Albertans to own or keep Norwegian rats of any description; the animals can be kept in the province by only zoos, universities and colleges, and recognized research institutions.
717	In 2009, several rats were found and captured, in small pockets in southern Alberta, putting Alberta's rat-free status in jeopardy.
717	A colony of rats were subsequently found in a landfill near Medicine Hat in 2012.
717	Paleontology  Alberta has one of the greatest diversities and abundances of Late Cretaceous dinosaur fossils in the world.
717	Taxa are represented by complete fossil skeletons, isolated material, microvertebrate remains, and even mass graves.
717	At least 38 dinosaur type specimens are known from the province.
717	The Foremost Formation, Oldman Formation and Dinosaur Park Formations collectively comprise the Judith River Group and are the most thoroughly studied dinosaur bearing strata in Alberta.
717	The stratigraphy of the Judith River Group has a confusing history due partly to the use of the Montana-Alberta border as an artificial division between equivalent strata.
717	The modern Judith River Group stratigraphy was not finalized until 1993 when Eberth and Hamblin divided the Oldman Formation in two to create the new Dinosaur Park Formation.
717	The resulting paleontological confusion was resolved by Phil Currie who relocated old quarries dinosaurs had been found in and determined their distribution within the modern stratigraphic framework.
717	Dinosaur-bearing strata are distributed widely throughout Alberta.
717	The Dinosaur Provincial Park area contains outcrops of the Dinosaur Park Formation and Oldman Formation.
717	In the central and southern regions of Alberta are intermittent Scollard Formation outcrops.
717	In the Drumheller Valley and Edmonton regions there are exposed Horseshoe Canyon facies.
717	Other formations have been recorded as well, like the Milk River and Foremost Formations.
717	However, these latter two have a lower diversity of documented dinosaurs, primarily due to their lower total fossil quantity and neglect from collectors who are hindered by the isolation and scarcity of exposed outcrops.
717	Their dinosaur fossils are primarily teeth recovered from microvertebrate fossil sites.
717	Additional geologic formations that have produced only few fossils are the Belly River Group and St.
717	Mary River Formations of the southwest and the northwestern Wapiti Formation.
717	The Wapiti Formations contains two Pachyrhinosaurus bone beds that break its general trend of low productivity, however.
717	The Bearpaw Formation represents strata deposited during a marine transgression.
717	Dinosaurs are known from this Formation, but represent specimens washed out to sea or reworked from older sediments.
717	History  The first people in Alberta were Paleo-Indians who arrived in Alberta at least 10,000 years ago, toward the end of the last ice age.
717	They probably migrated from Siberia to Alaska on a land bridge across the Bering Strait, and then may have moved down the east side of the Rocky Mountains through Alberta to settle the Americas.
717	Alternatively they may have migrated down the coast of British Columbia and then moved inland.
717	Over time they differentiated into various First Nations peoples, including the Plains Indian tribes of southern Alberta such as those of the Blackfoot Confederacy and the Plains Cree, who generally lived by hunting buffalo (American bison), and the more northerly tribes such as the Woodland Cree and Chipewyan who hunted, trapped, and fished for a living.
717	After the British arrival in Canada, approximately half of the province of Alberta, south of the Athabasca River drainage, became part of Rupert's Land which consisted of all land drained by rivers flowing into Hudson Bay.
717	This area was granted by Charles II of England to the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) in 1670, and rival fur trading companies were not allowed to trade in it.
717	After the arrival of French Canadians in the west around 1731, they settled near fur trading posts, establishing communities such as Lac La Biche and Bonnyville.
717	Fort La Jonquière was established near what is now Calgary in 1752.
717	The Athabasca River and the rivers north of it were not in HBC territory because they drained into the Arctic Ocean instead of Hudson Bay, and they were prime habitat for fur-bearing animals.
717	The first explorer of the Athabasca region was Peter Pond, who learned of the Methye Portage, which allowed travel from southern rivers into the rivers north of Rupert's Land.
717	Fur traders formed the North West Company (NWC) of Montreal to compete with the HBC in 1779.
717	The NWC occupied the northern part of Alberta territory.
717	Peter Pond built Fort Athabasca on Lac la Biche in 1778.
717	Roderick Mackenzie built Fort Chipewyan on Lake Athabasca ten years later in 1788.
717	His cousin, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, followed the North Saskatchewan River to its northernmost point near Edmonton, then setting northward on foot, trekked to the Athabasca River, which he followed to Lake Athabasca.
717	It was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his name—the Mackenzie River—which he followed to its outlet in the Arctic Ocean.
717	Returning to Lake Athabasca, he followed the Peace River upstream, eventually reaching the Pacific Ocean, and so he became the first white man to cross the North American continent north of Mexico.
717	The extreme southernmost portion of Alberta was part of the French (and Spanish) territory of Louisiana, sold to the United States in 1803; in 1818, the portion of Louisiana north of the Forty-Ninth Parallel was ceded to Great Britain.
717	Fur trade expanded in the north, but bloody battles occurred between the rival HBC and NWC, and in 1821 the British government forced them to merge to stop the hostilities.
717	The amalgamated Hudson's Bay Company dominated trade in Alberta until 1870, when the newly formed Canadian Government purchased Rupert's Land.
717	Northern Alberta was included in the North-Western Territory until 1870, when it and Rupert's land became Canada's Northwest Territories.
717	The district of Alberta was created as part of the North-West Territories in 1882.
717	As settlement increased, local representatives to the North-West Legislative Assembly were added.
717	After a long campaign for autonomy, in 1905 the district of Alberta was enlarged and givenre added.
717	After a provincial status, with the election of Alexander Cameron Rutherford as the first premier.
717	Demographics  Alberta has experienced a relatively high rate of growth in recent years, mainly because of its burgeoning economy.
717	Between 2003 and 2004, the province had high birthrates (on par with some larger provinces such as British Columbia), relatively high immigration, and a high rate of interprovincial migration when compared to other provinces.
717	Approximately 81% of the population live in urban areas and only about 19% live in rural areas.
717	The Calgary-Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized area in the province and is one of the most densely populated areas of Canada.
717	Many of Alberta's cities and towns have also experienced very high rates of growth in recent history.
717	Over the past century, Alberta's population rose from 73,022 in 1901 to 2,974,807 in 2001 and 3,290,350 according to the 2006 census.
717	The 2006 census found that English, with 2,576,670 native speakers, was the most common mother tongue of Albertans, representing 79.99% of the province's population.
717	The next most common mother tongues were various Chinese languages with 97,275 native speakers (3.02%), followed by German with 84,505 native speakers (2.62%) and French with 61,225 (1.90%).
717	Other mother tongues (in decreasing order) include: Punjabi, with 36,320 native speakers (1.13%); Tagalog, with 29,740 (0.92%); Ukrainian, with 29,455 (0.91%); Spanish, with 29,125 (0.90%); Polish, with 21,990 (0.68%); Arabic, with 20,495 (0.64%); Dutch, with 19,980 (0.62%); and Vietnamese, with 19,350 (0.60%).
717	The most common aboriginal language is Cree 17,215 (0.53%).
717	Other common mother tongues include Italian with 13,095 speakers (0.41%); Urdu with 11,275 (0.35%); and Korean with 10,845 (0.33%); then Hindi 8,985 (0.28%); Persian 7,700 (0.24%); Portuguese 7,205 (0.22%); and Hungarian 6,770 (0.21%).(Figures shown are for the number of single language responses and the percentage of total single-language responses.) Alberta has considerable ethnic diversity.
717	In line with the rest of Canada, many immigrants originated from England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales, but large numbers also came from other parts of Europe, notably Germans, French, Ukrainians and Scandinavians.
717	According to Statistics Canada, Alberta is home to the second highest proportion (two percent) of Francophones in western Canada (after Manitoba).
717	Despite this, relatively few Albertans claim French as their mother tongue.
717	Many of Alberta's French-speaking residents live in the central and northwestern regions of the province.
717	As reported in the 2001 census, the Chinese represented nearly four percent of Alberta's population, and East Indians represented more than two percent.
717	Both Edmonton and Calgary have historic Chinatowns, and Calgary has Canada's third largest Chinese community.
717	The Chinese presence began with workers employed in the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1880s.
717	Aboriginal Albertans make up approximately three percent of the population.
717	In the 2006 Canadian census, the most commonly reported ethnic origins among Albertans were: 885,825 English (27.2%); 679,705 German (20.9%); 667,405 Canadian (20.5%); 661,265 Scottish (20.3%); 539,160 Irish (16.6%); 388,210 French (11.9%); 332,180 Ukrainian (10.2%); 172,910 Dutch (5.3%); 170,935 Polish (5.2%); 169,355 North American Indian (5.2%); 144,585 Norwegian (4.4%); and 137,600 Chinese (4.2%).
717	Each person could choose as many ethnicities as were applicable.) Amongst those of British origins, the Scots have had a particularly strong influence on place-names, with the names of many cities and towns including Calgary, Airdrie, Canmore, and Banff having Scottish origins.
717	Alberta is the third most diverse province in terms of visible minorities after British Columbia and Ontario with 13.9% of the population consisting of visible minorities.
717	Nearly one-fourth of the populations of Calgary and Edmonton belong to a visible minority group.
717	Aboriginal Identity Peoples make up 5.8% of the population, about half of whom consist of North American Indians and the other half are Metis.
717	There are also small number of Inuit people in Alberta.
717	The number of Aboriginal Identity Peoples have been increasing at a rate greater than the population of Alberta.
717	As of the Canada 2001 Census the largest religious group was Roman Catholic, representing 25.7% of the population.
717	Alberta had the second highest percentage of non-religious residents in Canada (after British Columbia) at 23.1% of the population.
717	Of the remainder, 13.5% of the population identified themselves as belonging to the United Church of Canada, while 5.9% were Anglican.
717	Lutherans made up 4.8% of the population while Baptists comprised 2.5%.
717	The remainder belonged to a wide variety of different religious affiliations, none of which constituted more than 2% of the population.
717	The Mormons of Alberta reside primarily in the extreme south of the province and made up 1.7% of the population.
717	Alberta has a population of Hutterites, a communal Anabaptist sect similar to the Mennonites (Hutterites represented 0.4% of the population while Mennonites were 0.8%), and has a significant population of Seventh-day Adventists at 0.3%.
717	Alberta is home to several Byzantine Rite Churches as part of the legacy of Eastern European immigration, including the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Edmonton, and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada's Western Diocese which is based in Edmonton.
717	Muslims, Sikhs, and Hindus live in Alberta.
717	Muslims constituted 1.7% of the population, Sikhs 0.8% and Hindus 0.5%.
717	Many of these are recent immigrants, but others have roots that go back to the first settlers of the prairies.
717	Canada's oldest mosque, the Al-Rashid Mosque, is located in Edmonton, whereas Calgary is home to Canada's largest mosque, the Baitun Nur mosque.
717	Jews constituted 0.4% of Alberta's population.
717	Most of Alberta's 13,000 Jews live in Calgary (7,500) and Edmonton (5,000).
717	Municipalities  ;Largest metro areas and municipalities by population as of 2006 Economy  Alberta's economy is one of the strongest in Canada, supported by the burgeoning petroleum industry and to a lesser extent, agriculture and technology.
717	The per capita GDP in 2007 was by far the highest of any province in Canada at C$74,825.
717	This was 61% higher than the national average of C$46,441 and more than twice that of some of the Atlantic provinces.
717	In 2006 the deviation from the national average was the largest for any province in Canadian history.
717	According to the 2006 census, the median annual family income after taxes was $70,986 in Alberta (compared to $60,270 in Canada as a whole).
717	The Calgary-Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in Canada.
717	The region covers a distance of roughly 400 kilometres north to south.
717	In 2001, the population of the Calgary-Edmonton Corridor was 2.15 million (72% of Alberta's population).
717	It is also one of the fastest growing regions in the country.
717	A 2003 study by TD Bank Financial Group found the corridor to be the only Canadian urban centre to amass a U.S.
717	Canadian style quality of life, offering universal health care benefits.
717	The study found that GDP per capita in the corridor was 10% above average U.S.
717	Canadian cities at that time.
717	The Fraser Institute states that Alberta also has very high levels of economic freedom and rates Alberta as the freest economy in Canada, and the second freest economy amongst U.S.
717	Canadian provinces.
717	Industry  Alberta is the largest producer of conventional crude oil, synthetic crude, natural gas and gas products in the country.
717	Alberta is the world’s 2nd largest exporter of natural gas and the 4th largest producer.
717	Two of the largest producers of petrochemicals in North America are located in central and north-central Alberta.
717	In both Red Deer and Edmonton, world class polyethylene and vinyl manufacturers produce products shipped all over the world, and Edmonton's oil refineries provide the raw materials for a large petrochemical industry to the east of Edmonton.
717	The Athabasca oil sands have estimated unconventional oil reserves approximately equal to the conventional oil reserves of the rest of the world, estimated to be 1.6 trillion barrels (254 km3).
717	With the development of new extraction methods such as steam assisted gravity drainage, which was developed in Alberta, bitumen and synthetic crude oil can be produced at costs close to those of conventional crude.
717	Many companies employ both conventional strip mining and non-conventional in situ methods to extract the bitumen from the oil sands.
717	With current technology and at current prices, about 315 billion barrels (50 km3) of bitumen are recoverable.
717	Fort McMurray, one of Canada's fastest growing cities, has grown enormously in recent years because of the large corporations which have taken on the task of oil production.
717	As of late 2006 there were over $100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern Alberta.
717	Another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands is the price of oil.
717	The oil price increases since 2003 have made it profitable to extract this oil, which in the past would give little profit or even a loss.
717	With concerted effort and support from the provincial government, several high-tech industries have found their birth in Alberta, notably patents related to interactive liquid crystal display systems.
717	With a growing economy, Alberta has several financial institutions dealing with civil and private funds.
717	Agriculture and forestry  Agriculture has a significant position in the province's economy.
717	The province has over three million head of cattle, and Alberta beef has a healthy worldwide market.
717	Nearly one half of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta.
717	Alberta is one of the top producers of plains buffalo (bison) for the consumer market.
717	Sheep for wool and mutton are also raised.
717	Wheat and canola are primary farm crops, with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production; other grains are also prominent.
717	Much of the farming is dryland farming, often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation.
717	Continuous cropping (in which there is no fallow season) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion.
717	Across the province, the once common grain elevator is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreasing; farmers typically truck the grain to central points.
717	Alberta is the leading beekeeping province of Canada, with some beekeepers wintering hives indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta, then migrating north during the summer into the Peace River valley where the season is short but the working days are long for honeybees to produce honey from clover and fireweed.
717	Hybrid canola also requires bee pollination, and some beekeepers service this need.
717	The vast northern forest reserves of softwood allow Alberta to produce large quantities of lumber, oriented strand board (OSB) and plywood, and several plants in northern Alberta supply North America and the Pacific Rim nations with bleached wood pulp and newsprint.
717	Tourism  Alberta has been a tourist destination from the early days of the twentieth century, with attractions including outdoor locales for skiing, hiking and camping, shopping locales such as West Edmonton Mall, Calgary Stampede, outdoor festivals, professional athletic events, international sporting competitions such as the Commonwealth Games and Olympic Games, as well as more eclectic attractions.
717	There are also natural attractions like Elk Island National Park, Wood Buffalo National Park, and the Columbia Icefield.
717	According to Alberta Economic Development, Calgary and Edmonton both host over four million visitors annually.
717	Banff, Jasper and the Rocky Mountains are visited by about three million people per year.
717	Alberta tourism relies heavily on Southern Ontario tourists, as well as tourists from other parts of Canada, the United States, and many international countries.
717	Alberta's Rocky Mountains include well known tourist destinations Banff National Park and Jasper National Park.
717	The two mountain parks are connected by the scenic Icefields Parkway.
717	Banff is located 128 km west of Calgary on Highway 1, and Jasper is located 366 km west of Edmonton on Yellowhead Highway.
717	Five of Canada's fourteen UNESCO World heritage sites are located within the province: Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks, Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park, Wood Buffalo National Park, Dinosaur Provincial Park and Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump.
717	About 1.2 million people visit the of Calgary Stampede, a celebration of Canada's own Wild West and the cattle ranching industry.
717	About 700,000 people enjoy Edmonton's K-Days (formerly Klondike Days and Capital EX).
717	Edmonton was the gateway to the only all-Canadian route to the Yukon gold fields, and the only route which did not require gold-seekers to travel the exhausting and dangerous Chilkoot Pass.
717	Another tourist destination that draws more than 650,000 visitors each year is the Drumheller Valley, located northeast of Calgary.
717	Drumheller, "Dinosaur Capital of The World", offers the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
717	Drumheller also had a rich mining history being one of Western Canada's largest coal producers during the war years.
717	The Canadian Badlands has much to offer in the way of attractions, cultural events, celebrations, accommodations and service.
717	Located in east-central Alberta is Alberta Prairie Railway Excursions, a popular tourist attraction operated out of Stettler.
717	It boasts one of the few operable steam trains in the world, offering trips through the rolling prairie scenery.
717	Alberta Prairie Railway Excursions caters to tens of thousands of visitors every year.
717	Alberta is an important destination for tourists who love to ski and hike; Alberta boasts several world-class ski resorts such as Sunshine Village, Lake Louise, Marmot Basin, Norquay and Nakiska.
717	Hunters and fishermen from around the world are able to take home impressive trophies and tall tales from their experiences in Alberta's wilderness.
717	Government and politics The government of Alberta is organized as a parliamentary democracy with a unicameral legislature.
717	Its unicameral legislature—the Legislative Assembly—consists of eighty-seven members elected first past the post (FPTP) from single-member constituencies.
717	Locally municipal governments and school boards are elected and operate separately.
717	Their boundaries do not necessarily coincide.
717	Municipalities where the same body act as both local government and school board are formally referred to as "counties" in Alberta.
717	As Canada's head of state, Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state for the Government of Alberta.
717	Her duties in Alberta are carried out by Lieutenant Governor Donald Ethell.
717	Although the lieutenant governor is technically the most powerful person in Alberta, he is in reality a figurehead whose actions are restricted by custom and constitutional convention.
717	The government is therefore headed by the premier.
717	The current premier is Alison Redford who was elected as leader of the governing Progressive Conservatives on October 1, 2011.
717	Redford was sworn in as the 14th Premier of Alberta on October 7, 2011.
717	The Premier is a Member of the Legislative Assembly, and she draws all the members of her Cabinet from among the members of the Legislative Assembly.
717	The City of Edmonton is the seat of the provincial government—the capital of Alberta.
717	Alberta's elections tend to yield results which are much more conservative than those of other Canadian provinces.
717	Alberta has traditionally had three political parties, the Progressive Conservatives ("Conservatives" or "Tories"), the Liberals, and the social democratic New Democrats.
717	A fourth party, the strongly conservative Social Credit Party, was a power in Alberta for many decades, but fell from the political map after the Progressive Conservatives came to power in 1971.
717	Since that time, no other political party has governed Alberta.
717	In fact, only four parties have governed Alberta: the Liberals, from 1905 to 1921; the United Farmers of Alberta, from 1921 to 1935; the Social Credit Party, from 1935 to 1971, and the currently governing Progressive Conservative Party, from 1971 to the present.
717	Alberta has had occasional surges in separatist sentiment.
717	Even during the 1980s, when these feelings were at their strongest, there has never been enough interest in secession to initiate any major movements or referendums.
717	There are several currently active groups wishing to promote the independence of Alberta in some form.
717	In the 2008 provincial election, held on March 3, 2008, the Progressive Conservative Party was re-elected as a majority government with 72 of 83 seats, the Alberta Liberal Party was elected as the Official Opposition with nine members, and two Alberta New Democratic Party members were elected.
717	The April 23, 2012 election returned the Progressive Conservative Party to government, making leader Alison Redford Alberta's first elected female premier.
717	In the 2012 provincial election, held on April 23, 2012, the Progressive Conservative Party was re-elected as a majority government and party leader Alison Redford retained as premier with 43.9% of the vote and 61 of 87 seats (The Legislative Assembly added 4 seats, increasing the total to 87, with the 2012 election), the Wildrose Party led by Danielle Smith was elected as the Official Opposition with 34.3% of the vote and 17 members (replacing the Liberal Party), five Liberals were elected with 9.9% of the vote and four NDP members were elected with 9.8% of the vote.
717	Taxation  Government revenue comes mainly from royalties on non-renewable natural resources (30.4%), personal income taxes (22.3%), corporate and other taxes (19.6%), and grants from the federal government primarily for infrastructure projects (9.8%).
717	Albertans are the lowest-taxed people in Canada, and Alberta is the only province in Canada without a provincial sales tax (but residents are still subject to the federal sales tax, the Goods and Services Tax of 5%).
717	It is also the only Canadian province to have a flat tax for personal income taxes, which is 10% of taxable income.
717	The Alberta personal income tax system maintains a progressive character by granting residents personal tax exemptions of $16,977, in addition to a variety of tax deductions for persons with disabilities, students, and the aged.
717	Alberta's municipalities and school jurisdictions have their own governments which (usually) work in co-operation with the provincial government.
717	Alberta also privatized alcohol distribution.
717	The privatization increased outlets from 304 stores to 1,726; 1,300 jobs to 4,000 jobs; and 3,325 products to 16,495 products.
717	Tax revenue also increased from $400 million to $700 million.
717	Albertan municipalities raise a significant portion of their income through levying property taxes.
717	The value of assessed property in Alberta was approximately $727 billion in 2011.
717	Most real property is assessed according to its market value.
717	The exceptions to market value assessment are farmland, railways, machinery & equipment and linear property, all of which is assessed by regulated rates.
717	Depending on the property type, property owners may appeal a property assessment to their municipal 'Local Assessment Review Board', 'Composite Assessment Review Board,' or the Alberta Municipal Government Board.
717	Military  Military bases in Alberta include Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Cold Lake, CFB Edmonton, CFB Suffield and CFB Wainwright.
717	The air force is stationed at CFB Cold Lake and has access to the Cold Lake Air Weapons Range.
717	CFB Edmonton is the headquarters for the Land Force Western Area.
717	CFB Suffield hosts British troops and is the largest training facility in Canada.
717	Transportation  Alberta has over 181000 km of highways and roads, of which nearly 41000 km are paved.
717	The main north-south corridor is Highway 2, which begins south of Cardston at the Carway border crossing and is part of the CANAMEX Corridor.
717	Highway 4, which effectively extends Interstate 15 into Alberta and is the busiest U.S.
717	Coutts border crossing and ends at Lethbridge.
717	Highway 3 joins Lethbridge to Fort Macleod and links Highway 4 to Highway 2.
717	Highway 2 travels northward through Fort Macleod, Calgary, Red Deer, and Edmonton.
717	North of Edmonton, the highway continues to Athabasca, then northwesterly along the south shore of Lesser Slave Lake into High Prairie, north to Peace River, west to Fairview and finally south to Grande Prairie, where it ends at an interchange with Highway 43.
717	The section of Highway 2 between Calgary and Edmonton has been named the Queen Elizabeth II Highway to commemorate the visit of the monarch in 2005.
717	Highway 2 is supplemented by two more highways that run parallel to it: Highway 22, west of Highway 2, known as Cowboy Trail, and Highway 21, east of Highway 2.
717	Highway 43 travels northwest into Grande Prairie and the Peace River Country; Highway 63 travels northeast to Fort McMurray, the location of the Athabasca Oil Sands.
717	Alberta has two main east-west corridors.
717	The southern corridor, part of the Trans-Canada Highway system, enters the province near Medicine Hat, runs westward through Calgary, and leaves Alberta through Banff National Park.
717	The northern corridor, also part of the Trans-Canada network and known as the Yellowhead Highway (Highway 16), runs west from Lloydminster in eastern Alberta, through Edmonton and Jasper National Park into British Columbia.
717	One of the most scenic drives is along the Icefields Parkway, which runs for 228 km between Jasper and Lake Louise, with mountain ranges and glaciers on either side of its entire length.
717	Another major corridor through central Alberta is Highway 11 (also known as the David Thompson Highway), which runs east from the Saskatchewan River Crossing in Banff National Park through Rocky Mountain House and Red Deer, connecting with Highway 12 20 km west of Stettler.
717	The highway connects many of the smaller towns in central Alberta with Calgary and Edmonton, as it crosses Highway 2 just west of Red Deer.
717	Urban stretches of Alberta's major highways and freeways are often called trails.
717	For example, Highway 2, the main north-south highway in the province, is called Deerfoot Trail as it passes through Calgary but becomes Calgary Trail (for southbound traffic) and Gateway Boulevard (for northbound traffic) as it enters Edmonton and then turns into St.
717	Albert Trail as it leaves Edmonton for the City of St.
717	Albert.
717	Calgary, in particular, has a tradition of calling its largest urban expressways trails and naming many of them af callinfter prominent First Nations individuals and tribes, such as Crowchild Trail, Deerfoot Trail, and Stoney Trail.
717	Calgary, Edmonton, Red Deer, Medicine Hat, and Lethbridge have substantial public transit systems.
717	In addition to buses, Calgary and Edmonton operate light rail transit (LRT) systems.
717	Edmonton LRT, which is underground in the downtown core and on the surface outside of it, was the first of the modern generation of light rail systems to be built in North America, while the Calgary C-Train has one of the highest number of daily riders of any LRT system in North America.
717	Alberta is well-connected by air, with international airports in both Calgary and Edmonton.
717	Calgary International Airport and Edmonton International Airport are the fourth and fifth busiest in Canada respectively.
717	Calgary's airport is a hub for WestJet Airlines and a regional hub for Air Canada.
717	Calgary's airport primarily serves the Canadian prairie provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba) for connecting flights to British Columbia, eastern Canada, 15 major US centres, nine European airports, one Asian airport and four destinations in Mexico and the Caribbean.
717	Edmonton's airport acts as a hub for the Canadian north and has connections to all major Canadian airports as well as 10 major US airports, 3 European airports and 6 Mexican and Caribbean airports.
717	There are more than 9000 km of operating mainline railway; the Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railway companies operate railway freight across the province.
717	Passenger trains include Via Rail's Canadian (Toronto-Vancouver) or Jasper-Prince Rupert trains, which use the CN mailine and pass through Jasper National Park and parallel the Yellowhead Highway during at least part of their routes.
717	The Rocky Mountaineer operates two sections: one from Vancouver to Banff and Calgary over CP tracks, and a section that travels over CN tracks to Jasper.
717	These trains provide some the most scenic train rides in the world.
717	Health care  As with all Canadian provinces, Alberta provides for all citizens and residents through a publicly funded health care system.
717	Alberta became Canada's second province (after Saskatchewan) to adopt a Tommy Douglas-style program in 1950, a precursor to the modern medicare system.
717	Alberta's health care budget is currently $13.2 billion during the 2008–2009 fiscal year (approximately 36% of all government spending), making it the best funded health care system per-capita in Canada.
717	Every hour more than $1.7 million is spent on health care in the province.
717	A highly educated population and burgeoning economy have made Alberta a national leader in health education, research, and resources.
717	Many notable facilities include the Foothills Medical Centre, the Peter Lougheed Centre, Rockyview General Hospital, Alberta Children's Hospital, Grace Women's Health Centre, The University of Calgary Medical Centre (UCMC), Tom Baker Cancer Centre and Libin Cardiovascular Institute of Alberta, in Calgary; In Edmonton, the University of Alberta Hospital, the Royal Alexandra Hospital, the Grey Nuns Hospital, the Misericordia Hospital, the Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute, the Lois Hole Hospital for Women, the Stollery Children's Hospital, the Alberta Diabetes Institute, the Cross Cancer Institute, and the Rexall Centre for Pharmacy and Health Research in Edmonton.
717	Currently under construction in Edmonton is the new $909 million Edmonton Clinic, which will provide a similar research, education, and care environment as the Mayo Clinic in the United States.
717	All public health care services funded by the Government of Alberta are delivered operationally by Alberta Health Services.
717	AHS is the province's single health authority established on July 1, 2008 which replaced nine local health authorities.
717	AHS also funds all ground ambulance services in the province, as well as the province-wide STARS (Shock Trauma Air Rescue Society) air ambulance service.
717	Education  As with any Canadian province, the Alberta Legislature has (almost) exclusive authority to make laws respecting education.
717	Since 1905 the Legislature has used this capacity to continue the model of locally elected public and separate school boards which originated prior to 1905, as well as to create and/or regulate universities, colleges, technical institutions and other educational forms and institutions (public charter schools, private schools, home schooling).
717	Elementary schools  There are forty-two public school jurisdictions in Alberta, and seventeen operating separate school jurisdictions.
717	Sixteen of the operating separate school jurisdictions have a Catholic electorate, and one (St.
717	Albert) has a Protestant electorate.
717	In addition, one Protestant separate school district, Glen Avon, survives as a ward of the St.
717	Paul Education Region.
717	The City of Lloydminster straddles the Alberta/Saskatchewan border, and both the public and separate school systems in that city are counted in the above numbers: both of them operate according to Saskatchewan law.
717	For many years the provincial government has funded the greater part of the cost of providing K–12 education.
717	Prior to 1994 public and separate school boards in Alberta had the legislative authority to levy a local tax on property, as supplementary support for local education.
717	In 1994 the government of the province eliminated this right for public school boards, but not for separate school boards.
717	Since 1994 there has continued to be a tax on property in support of K–12 education; the difference is that the mill rate is now set by the provincial government, the money is collected by the local municipal authority and remitted to the provincial government.
717	The relevant legislation requires that all the money raised by this property tax must go to the support of K–12 education provided by school boards.
717	The provincial government pools the property tax funds from across the province and distributes them, according to a formula, to public and separate school jurisdictions and Francophone authorities.
717	Public and separate school boards, charter schools, and prPublic school (goverivate schools all follow the Program of Studies and the curriculum approved by the provincial department of education (Alberta Education).
717	Home schoolers may choose to follow the Program of Studies or develop their own Program of Studies.
717	Public and separate schools, charter schools, and approved private schools all employ teachers who are certificated by Alberta Education, they administer Provincial Achievement Tests and Diploma Examinations set by Alberta Education, and they may grant high school graduation certificates endorsed by Alberta Education.
717	Universities  The University of Alberta, established in Edmonton in 1908, is Alberta's oldest and largest university.
717	The University of Calgary, once affiliated with the University of Alberta, gained its autonomy in 1966 and is now the second largest university in Alberta.
717	There is also Athabasca University, which focuses on distance learning, and the University of Lethbridge, both of which are located in their title cities.
717	In early September 2009, Mount Royal University became Calgary's second public university, and in late September 2009, a similar move made MacEwan University Edmonton's second public university.
717	There are 15 colleges that receive direct public funding, along with two technical institutes, Northern Alberta Institute of Technology and Southern Alberta Institute of Technology.
717	There is also a large and active private sector of post-secondary institutions, mostly Christian Universities, bringing the total number of universities to twelve, plus a DeVry University in Calgary, the only location in Canada.
717	Students may also receive government loans and grants while attending selected private institutions.
717	There has been some controversy in recent years over the rising cost of post-secondary education for students (as opposed to taxpayers).
717	In 2005, Premier Ralph Klein made a promise that he would freeze tuition and look into ways of reducing schooling costs.
717	So far, no plan has been released by the government of Alberta.
717	Culture  Summer brings many festivals to the province of Alberta, especially in Edmonton.
717	The Edmonton Fringe Festival is the world's second largest after Edinburgh's.
717	Both Calgary and Edmonton host a number of annual festivals and events including folk music festivals.
717	With a large number of summer and winter events, Edmonton prides itself as being the "Festival City".
717	The city's "heritage days" festival sees the participation of over 70 ethnic groups.
717	Edmonton's Churchill Square is home to a large number of the festivals, including the large Taste of Edmonton & The Works Art & Design Festival throughout the summer months.
717	The City of Calgary is also famous for its Stampede, dubbed "The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth."
717	The Stampede is Canada's biggest rodeo festival and features various races and competitions, such as calf roping and bull riding.
717	In line with the western tradition of rodeo are the cultural artisans that reside and create unique Alberta western heritage crafts.
717	The Banff Centre hosts a range of festivals and other events including the international Mountain Film Festival.
717	These cultural events in Alberta highlight the province's cultural diversity.
717	Most of the major cities have several performing theatre companies who entertain in venues as diverse as Edmonton's Arts Barns and the Francis Winspear Centre for Music.
717	Both Calgary and Edmonton are home to Canadian Football League and National Hockey League teams.
717	Soccer, rugby union and lacrosse are also played professionally in Alberta.
717	Friendship partners  Alberta has relationships with several provinces, states, and other entities worldwide.

718	The Arctic Circle is one of the five major circles of latitude that mark maps of the Earth.
718	In 2012, it is the parallel of latitude that runs   north of the Equator.
718	The region north of this circle is known as the Arctic, and the zone just to the south is called the Northern Temperate Zone.
718	The equivalent polar circle in the Southern Hemisphere is called the Antarctic Circle.
718	The Arctic Circle is the southernmost latitude in the Northern Hemisphere at which the sun can remain continuously above or below the horizon for 24 hours (at the June solstice and December solstice respectively).
718	North of the Arctic Circle, the sun is above the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least once per year (and therefore visible at midnight) and below the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least once per year.
718	On the Arctic Circle those events occur, in principle, exactly once per year, at the June and December solstices, respectively.
718	It would therefore seem that the Arctic Circle marks the southern extremity of the northern hemisphere polar day (24-hour sunlit day, often referred to as the midnight sun) and polar night (24-hour sunless night).
718	In fact, because of atmospheric refraction and mirages, and because the sun appears as a disk and not a point, part of the midnight sun may be seen on the night of the northern summer solstice up to about 50′ (90 km) south of the Arctic Circle; similarly, on the day of the northern winter solstice, part of the sun may be seen up to about 50′ north of the Arctic Circle.
718	That is true at sea level; those limits increase with elevation above sea level although in mountainous regions, there is often no direct view of the true horizon.
718	The position of the Arctic Circle is not fixed.
718	It directly depends on the Earth's axial tilt, which fluctuates within a margin of 2° over a 40,000 year period, notably due to tidal forces resulting from the orbit of the Moon.
718	The Arctic Circle is currently drifting northwards at a speed of about 15 m per year; see Circle of latitude for more information.
718	TOC__ Geography Relatively few people live north of the Arctic Circle due to the Arctic climate.
718	The three largest communities above the Arctic Circle are situated in Russia: Murmansk (population 307,257), Norilsk (175,301), and Vorkuta (70,548).
718	Tromsø (in Norway) has about 69,000 inhabitants and Bodø 47,000.
718	In contrast, the largest North American community north of the circle, Sisimiut (Greenland), has approximately 5,000 inhabitants, while between Canada and the USA, Barrow, Alaska is the largest settlement with circa 4,000 inhabitants.
718	Rovaniemi (in Finland), which lies slightly south of the line, has a population of approximately 60,000, and is the largest settlement in the immediate vicinity of the Arctic Circle.
718	Among the people of the Arctic, the Norwegians have the easiest climate, with most ports in North Norway remaining ice-free all the year as a result of the Gulf Stream.
718	The Arctic Circle passes through the Arctic Ocean, the Scandinavian Peninsula, North Asia, Northern America and Greenland.
718	The land on the Arctic Circle is divided among eight countries: Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, the United States (Alaska), Canada, Denmark (Greenland), and Iceland (where it passes through the small offshore island of Grímsey).
718	The area north of the Arctic Circle is about  and covers 8% of the Earth.
718	Starting at the Prime Meridian and heading eastwards, the Arctic Circle passes through:

735	Al Gore
736	Albert Einstein (;; 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the general theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics).
736	While best known for his mass–energy equivalence formula  (which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation"), he received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect".
736	The latter was pivotal in establishing quantum theory.
736	Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field.
736	This led to the development of his special theory of relativity.
736	He realized, however, that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields, and with his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916, he published a paper on the general theory of relativity.
736	He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules.
736	He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light.
736	In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe as a whole.
736	He was visiting the United States when Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933 and did not go back to Germany, where he had been a professor at the Berlin Academy of Sciences.
736	He settled in the U.S., becoming an American citizen in 1940.
736	On the eve of World War II, he helped alert President Franklin D.
736	Roosevelt that Germany might be developing an atomic weapon and recommended that the U.S.
736	Manhattan Project.
736	Einstein was in support of defending the Allied forces, but largely denounced using the new discovery of nuclear fission as a weapon.
736	Later, with the British philosopher Bertrand Russell, Einstein signed the Russell–Einstein Manifesto, which highlighted the danger of nuclear weapons.
736	Einstein was affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, until his death in 1955.
736	Einstein published more than 300 scientific papers along with over 150 non-scientific works.
736	His great intellectual achievements and originality have made the word "Einstein" synonymous with genius.
736	Biography Early life and education s with energy hf each, where h is Planck's constant.
736	He does not say much more, because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave.
736	But he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect.
736	Quantized atomic vibrations In 1907 Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator.
736	In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently – a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator.
736	Einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be different, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics.
736	Peter Debye refined this model.
736	Adiabatic principle and action-angle variables Throughout the 1910s, quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems.
736	After Ernest Rutherford discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets, Niels Bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by Planck and developed by Einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the periodic table of the elements.
736	Einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments Wilhelm Wien had made.
736	Wien had shown that the hypothesis of adiabatic invariance of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the blackbody curves at different temperature to be derived from one another by a simple shifting process.
736	Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant.
736	Arnold Sommerfeld identified this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics.
736	The law that the action variable is quantized was a basic principle of the quantum theory as it was known between 1900 and 1925.
736	Wave–particle duality Although the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner Second Class in 1906, he had not given up on academia.
736	In 1908, he became a privatdozent at the University of Bern.
736	In "über die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen über das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung" ("The Development of Our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation"), on the quantization of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck's energy quanta must have well-defined momenta and act in some respects as independent, point-like particles.
736	This paper introduced the photon concept (although the name photon was introduced later by Gilbert N.
736	Lewis in 1926) and inspired the notion of wave–particle duality in quantum mechanics.
736	Theory of critical opalescence Einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point.
736	Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density.
736	At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations.
736	The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white.
736	Einstein relates this to Raleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue.
736	Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.
736	Zero-point energy Einstein's physical intuition led him to note that Planck's oscillator energies had an incorrect zero point.
736	He modified Planck's hypothesis by stating that the lowest energy state of an oscillator is equal to hf, to half the energy spacing between levels.
736	This argument, which was made in 1913 in collaboration with Otto Stern, was based on the thermodynamics of a diatomic molecule which can split apart into two free atoms.
736	General relativity and the Equivalence Principle General relativity (GR) is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Albert Einstein between 1907 and 1915.
736	According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses.
736	General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics.
736	It provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.
736	As Albert Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within special relativity was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated ones) should appear more satisfactory.
736	So in 1908 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity.
736	In that article, he argued that free fall is really inertial motion, and that for a freefalling observer the rules of special relativity must apply.
736	This argument is called the Equivalence principle.
736	In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomenon of gravitational time dilation.
736	In 1911, Einstein published another article expanding on the 1907 article, in which additional effects such as the deflection of light by massive bodies were predicted.
736	Hole argument and Entwurf theory While developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the gauge invariance in the theory.
736	He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible.
736	He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations, and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.
736	In June 1913 the Entwurf ("draft") theory was the result of these investigations.
736	As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions.
736	Simultaneously less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, after more than two years of intensive work Einselegant and more dtein abandoned the theory in November 1915 after realizing that the hole argument was mistaken.
736	Cosmology In 1917, Einstein applied the General theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe as a whole.
736	He wanted the universe to be eternal and unchanging, but this type of universe is not consistent with relativity.
736	To fix this, Einstein modified the general theory by introducing a new notion, the cosmological constant.
736	With a positive cosmological constant, the universe could be an eternal static sphere.
736	Einstein believed a spherical static universe is philosophically preferred, because it would obey Mach's principle.
736	He had shown that general relativity incorporates Mach's principle to a certain extent in frame dragging by gravitomagnetic fields, but he knew that Mach's idea would not work if space goes on forever.
736	In a closed universe, he believed that Mach's principle would hold.
736	Mach's principle has generated much controversy over the years.
736	Modern quantum theory Einstein was displeased with quantum theory and mechanics, despite its acceptance by other physicists, stating "God doesn't play with dice."
736	As Einstein passed away at the age of 76 he still would not accept quantum theory.
736	In 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser.
736	This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode.
736	This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws.
736	Einstein discovered Louis de Broglie's work, and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first.
736	In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a wave equation for de Broglie waves, which Einstein suggested was the Hamilton–Jacobi equation of mechanics.
736	This paper would inspire Schrödinger's work of 1926.
736	Bose–Einstein statistics In 1924, Einstein received a description of a statistical model from Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles.
736	Einstein noted that Bose's statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the Zeitschrift für Physik.
736	Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the Bose–Einstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures.
736	It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by Eric Allin Cornell and Carl Wieman using ultra-cooling equipment built at the NIST–JILA laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder.
736	Bose–Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons.
736	Einstein's sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University.
736	Energy momentum pseudotensor General relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum.
736	Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry.
736	The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.
736	Einstein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons, because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates.
736	He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field.
736	This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard.
736	The use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by Erwin Schrödinger and others.
736	Unified field theory Following his research on general relativity, Einstein entered into a series of attempts to generalize his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism as another aspect of a single entity.
736	In 1950, he described his "unified field theory" in a Scientific American article entitled "On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation".
736	Although he continued to be lauded for his work, Einstein became increasingly isolated in his research, and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.
736	In his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces, Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics, most notably the strong and weak nuclear forces, which were not well understood until many years after his death.
736	Mainstream physics, in turn, largely ignored Einstein's approaches to unification.
736	Einstein's dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a theory of everything and in particular string theory, where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting.
736	Wormholes Einstein collaborated with others to produce a model of a wormhole.
736	His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper "Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles?".
736	These solutions cut and pasted Schwarzschild black holes to make a bridge between two patches.
736	If one end of a wormhole was positively charged, the other end would be negatively charged.
736	These properties led Einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way.
736	Einstein–Cartan theory In order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part, called the torsion.
736	This modification was made by Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s.
736	Equations of motion The theory of general relativity has a fundamental law  – the Einstein equations which describe hoof general relativity has a fundamw space curves, the geodesic equation which describes how particles move may be derived from the Einstein equations.
736	Since the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined by the Einstein equations themselves, not by a new law.
736	So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.
736	This was established by Einstein, Infeld, and Hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum, and by Roy Kerr for spinning objects.
736	Other investigations Einstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned.
736	These pertain to force, superconductivity, gravitational waves, and other research.
736	Please see the main article for details.
736	Collaboration with other scientists In addition to longtime collaborators Leopold Infeld, Nathan Rosen, Peter Bergmann and others, Einstein also had some one-shot collaborations with various scientists.
736	Einstein–de Haas experiment Einstein and De Haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin.
736	In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a torsion pendulum.
736	They confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron's angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes.
736	This experiment needed to be sensitive, because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.
736	Schrödinger gas model Einstein suggested to Erwin Schrödinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a Bose–Einstein gas by considering a box.
736	Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator.
736	Quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number, which will be the number of particles in it.
736	This formulation is a form of second quantization, but it predates modern quantum mechanics.
736	Erwin Schrödinger applied this to derive the thermodynamic properties of a semiclassical ideal gas.
736	Schrödinger urged Einstein to add his name as co-author, although Einstein declined the invitation.
736	Einstein refrigerator In 1926, Einstein and his former student Leó Szilárd co-invented (and in 1930, patented) the Einstein refrigerator.
736	This absorption refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input.
736	On 11 November 1930,  was awarded to Albert Einstein and Leó Szilárd for the refrigerator.
736	Their invention was not immediately put into commercial production, as the most promising of their patents were quickly bought up by the Swedish company Electrolux to protect its refrigeration technology from competition.
736	Bohr versus Einstein  The Bohr–Einstein debates were a series of public disputes about quantum mechanics between Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr who were two of its founders.
736	Their debates are remembered because of their importance to the philosophy of science.
736	Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox In 1935, Einstein returned to the question of quantum mechanics.
736	He considered how a measurement on one of two entangled particles would affect the other.
736	He noted, along with his collaborators, that by performing different measurements on the distant particle, either of position or momentum, different properties of the entangled partner could be discovered without disturbing it in any way.
736	He then used a hypothesis of local realism to conclude that the other particle had these properties already determined.
736	The principle he proposed is that if it is possible to determine what the answer to a position or momentum measurement would be, without in any way disturbing the particle, then the particle actually has values of position or momentum.
736	This principle distilled the essence of Einstein's objection to quantum mechanics.
736	As a physical principle, it was shown to be incorrect when the Aspect experiment of 1982 confirmed Bell's theorem, which had been promulgated in 1964.
736	Political and religious views Albert Einstein's political view was in favor of socialism; his political views emerged publicly in the middle of the 20th century due to his fame and reputation for genius.
736	Einstein offered to and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics.
736	Einstein's views about religious belief have been collected from interviews and original writings.
736	These views covered Judaism, theological determinism, agnosticism, and humanism.
736	He also wrote much about ethical culture, opting for Spinoza's god over belief in a personal god.
736	Love of music Einstein developed an appreciation of music at an early age.
736	His mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the violin, not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate German culture.
736	According to conductor Leon Botstein, Einstein is said to have begun playing when he was five, but did not enjoy it at that age.
736	When he turned thirteen, however, he discovered the violin sonatas of Mozart.
736	"Einstein fell in love" with Mozart's music, notes Botstein, and learned to play music more willingly.
736	According to Einstein, he taught himself to play by "ever practicing systematically," adding that "Love is a better teacher than a sense of duty."
736	At age seventeen, he was heard by a school examiner in Aarau as he played Beethoven's violin sonatas, the examiner stating afterward that his playing was "remarkable and revealing of 'great insight.'" What struck the examiner, writes Botstein, was that Einstein "displayed a deep love of the music, a quality that was and remains in short supply.
736	Music possessed an unusual meaning for this student."
736	Botstein notes that music assumed a pivotal and permanent role in Einstein's life from that period on.
736	Although the idea of becoming a professional himself was not on his mind at any time, among those with whom Einstein played chamber music were a few professionals, and he performed for private audiences and friends.
736	Chamber music also became a regular part of his social life while living in Bern, Zurich, and Berlin, where he played with Max Planck and his son, among others.
736	In 1931, while engaged in research at California Institute of Technology, he visited the Zoellner family conservatory in Los Angeles and played some of Beethoven and Mozart's works with members of the Zoellner Quartet, recently retired from two decades of acclaimed touring all across the United States; Einstein later presented the family patriarch with an autographed photograph as a memento.
736	Near the end of his life, when the young Juilliard Quartet visited him in Princeton, he played his violin with them; although they slowed the tempo to accommodate his lesser technical abilities, Botstein notes the quartet was "impressed by Einstein's level of coordination and intonation."
736	Non-scientific legacy While travelling, Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted stepdaughters Margot and Ilse.
736	The letters were included in the papers bequeathed to The Hebrew University.
736	Margot Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death (she died in 1986).
736	Barbara Wolff, of The Hebrew University's Albert Einstein Archives, told the BBC that there are about 3,500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955.
736	Einstein bequeathed the royalties from use of his image to The Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
736	Corbis, successor to The Roger Richman Agency, licenses the use of his name and associated imagery, as agent for the university.
736	In popular culture In the period before World War II, Einstein was so well known in America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain "that theory".
736	He finally figured out a way to handle the incessant inquiries.
736	He told his inquirers "Pardon me, sorry!
736	Always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein."
736	Einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels, films, plays, and works of music.
736	He is a favorite model for depictions of mad scientists and absent-minded professors; his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated.
736	Time magazine's Frederic Golden wrote that Einstein was "a cartoonist's dream come true".
736	Awards and honors Einstein received numerous awards and honors, including the Nobel Prize in Physics.

737	Afghanistan (; ; ), officially the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, is a landlocked sovereign state forming part of South Asia, Central Asia, and to some extent Western Asia.
737	It has a population of around 30 million inhabiting an area of approximately 647500 km², making it the 42nd most populous and 41st largest nation in the world.
737	It is bordered by Pakistan in the south and the east, Iran in the west, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan in the north, and China in the far northeast.
737	Afghanistan has been an ancient focal point of the Silk Road and human migration.
737	Archaeologists have found evidence of human habitation from as far back as the Middle Paleolithic.
737	Urban civilization may have begun in the area as early as 3,000 to 2,000 BCE.
737	Sitting at an important geostrategic location that connects the Middle East culture with Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent, the land has been home to various peoples through the ages and witnessed many military campaigns, notably by Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, and in modern era Western forces.
737	The land also served as a source from which the Greco-Bactrians, Kushans, Hephthalites, Saffarids, Ghaznavids, Ghorids, Khiljis, Timurids, Mughals, Durranis, and others have risen to form major empires.
737	The political history of the modern state of Afghanistan begins in 1709, when the Hotaki dynasty was established in Kandahar followed by Ahmad Shah Durrani's rise to power in 1747.
737	In the late 19th century, Afghanistan became a buffer state in the "Great Game" between the British and Great Game|Russian empires.
737	Following the 1919 Anglo-Afghan War, King Amanullah began a European style modernization of the country but was stopped by the ultra-conservatives.
737	During the Cold War, after the withdrawal of the British from neighboring India in 1947, the United States and the Soviet Union began spreading influences in Afghanistan, which led to a bloody war between the US-backed mujahideen forces and the Soviet-backed Afghan government in which over a million Afghans lost their lives.
737	This was followed by the 1990s civil war, the rise and fall of the extremist Taliban government and the 2001–present war.
737	In December 2001, the United Nations Security Council authorized the creation of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to help maintain security in Afghanistan and assist the Karzai administration.
737	Three decades of war made Afghanistan one of the world's most dangerous countries, including the largest producer of refugees and asylum seekers.
737	While the international community is rebuilding war-torn Afghanistan, terrorist groups such as the Haqqani Network and Hezbi Islami are actively involved in a nationwide Taliban-led insurgency, which includes hundreds of assassinations and suicide attacks.
737	According to the United Nations, the insurgents were responsible for 80% of civilian casualties in 2011 and 2012.
737	Etymology The name Afghānistān (,) means "Land of the Afghans", which originates from the ethnonym "Afghan".
737	Historically, the name "Afghan" mainly designated the Pashtun people, the largest ethnic group of Afghanistan.
737	This name is mentioned in the form of Abgan in the 3rd century CE by the Sassanians and as Avagana (Afghana) in the 6th century CE by Indian astronomer Varahamihira.
737	A people called the Afghans are mentioned several times in a 10th century geography book, Hudud al-'alam, particularly where a reference is made to a village: "Saul, a pleasant village on a mountain.
737	In it live Afghans."
737	Al-Biruni referred to them in the 11th century as various tribes living on the western frontier mountains of the Indus River, which would be the Sulaiman Mountains.
737	Ibn Battuta, a famous Moroccan scholar visiting the region in 1333, writes:  One prominent 16th-century Persian scholar explains extensively about the Afghans.
737	For example, he writes: It is widely accepted that the terms "Pashtun" and Afghan are synonyms.
737	In the writings of the 17th-century Pashto poet Khushal Khan Khattak it is mentioned:
738	Albania ( , ; Gheg Albanian: Shqipni/Shqipnia), officially known as the Republic of Albania ( pronounced), is a country in Southeastern Europe.
738	It is bordered by Montenegro to the northwest, Kosovo (Disputed) to the northeast, Macedonia to the east and Greece to the south and southeast.
738	It has a coast on the Adriatic Sea to the west, and on the Ionian Sea to the southwest.
738	It is less than 72 km from Italy, across the Strait of Otranto which links the Adriatic Sea to the Ionian Sea.
738	Albania is a member of the UN, NATO, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, Council of Europe, World Trade Organisation, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and one of the founding members of the Union for the Mediterranean.
738	Albania has been a potential candidate for accession to the European Union since January 2003, and it formally applied for EU membership on 28 April 2009.
738	The modern-day territory of Albania was at various points in history part of the Roman provinces of Dalmatia (southern Illyricum), Macedonia (particularly Epirus Nova), and Moesia Superior.
738	The modern Republic became independent after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in Europe following the Balkan Wars.
738	Albanians had for almost five centuries been at the heart of a sprawling empire in which they enjoyed a privileged position as administrators and generals.
738	Albania declared independence in 1912 (to be recognised in 1913), becoming a Principality, Republic, and Kingdom until being invaded by Italy in 1939, which formed Greater Albania, which in turn became a Nazi protectorate in 1943.
738	Free-market reforms have opened the country to foreign investment, especially in the development of energy and transportation infrastructure.
738	Albania was chosen as the No.1 Destination in Lonely Planet's list of ten top countries to visit for 2011.
738	Etymology and terminology Albania is the Medieval Latin name of the country which is called Shqipëri by its people.
738	In Medieval Greek, the country's name is Albania besides variants Albanitia, Arbanitia.
738	The name may be derived from the Illyrian tribe of the Albani recorded by Ptolemy, the geographer and astronomer from Alexandria who drafted a map in 150 AD that shows the city of Albanopolis (located northeast of Durrës).
738	The name may have a continuation in the name of a medieval settlement called Albanon and Arbanon, although it is not certain this was the same place.
738	In his History written in 1079–1080, Byzantine historian Michael Attaliates was the first to refer to Albanoi as having taken part in a revolt against Constantinople in 1043 and to the Arbanitai as subjects of the Duke of Dyrrachium.
738	During the Middle Ages, the Albanians called their country Arbër or Arbën and referred to themselves as Arbëresh or Arbnesh.
738	As early as the 16th century the placename Shqipëria and the ethnic demonym Shqiptarë gradually replaced Arbëria and Arbëresh.
738	While the two terms are popularly interpreted as "Land of the Eagles" and "Children of the Eagles", they derive from the adverb shqip, which means "understanding each other".
738	Under the Ottoman Empire Albania was referred to officially as Arnavutluk and its inhabitants as Arnauts (officially Arnavutlar).
738	These terms remain the same officially and in common usage in the current Republic of Turkey.
738	The word is considered to be a metathesis from the word Arvanite, which was the Medieval Greek name for the Albanians.
738	History The history of Albania emerged from the prehistoric stage from the 4th century BC, with early records of Illyria in Greco-Roman historiography.
738	The modern territory of Albania has no counterpart in antiquity, comprising parts of the Roman provinces of Dalmatia (southern Illyricum) and Macedonia(particularly Epirus Nova).
738	The territory remained under Roman (Byzantine) control until the Slavic migrations of the 7th century, and was integrated into the Bulgarian Empire in the 9th century.
738	The territorial nucleus of the Albanian state formed in the Middle Ages, as the Principality of Arbër and the Kingdom of Albania.
738	The first records of the Albanian people as a distinct ethnicity also date to this period.
738	Ottoman Period At the dawn of the establishment of the Ottoman Empire in Southeast Europe, the geopolitical landscape was marked by scattered kingdoms of small principalities.
738	The Ottomans erected their garrisons throughout southern Albania by 1415 and established formal jurisdiction over most of Albania by 1431.
738	Along with the Bosniaks, Muslim Albanians occupied an outstanding position in the empire, and were the main pillars of Ottoman policy in the Balkans.
738	Enjoying this privileged position in the empire, Muslim Albanians held various administrative positions, with over two dozen  Grand Viziers of Albanian origin, such as Gen.
738	Köprülü Mehmed Pasha, who commanded the Ottoman forces during the Ottoman-Persian Wars; Gen.
738	Köprülü Fazıl Ahmed, who led the Ottoman army during the Austro-Turkish War (1663–1664); and, later, Muhammad Ali Pasha of Egypt.
738	In the 15th century, when the Ottomans were gaining a firm foothold in the region, Albanian towns were organised into four principal sanjaks.
738	The government fostered trade by settling a sizeable Jewish colony of refugees fleeing persecution in Spain (at end of the 15th century).
738	Vlorë saw passing through its ports imported merchandise from Europe such as velvets, cotton goods, mohairs, carpets, spices and leather from Bursa and Istanbul.
738	Some citizens of Vlorë even had business associates in Europe.
738	Albanians could also be found throughout the empire, in Iraq, Egypt, Algeria and across the Maghreb as vital military and administrative retainers.
738	This owed largely to their early use as part of the Devşirme system.
738	The process of Islamization was an incremental one, commencing from the arrival of the Ottomans in the 14th century (to this day, a minority of Albanians are Catholic or Orthodox Christians, though the vast majority became Muslim).
738	Timar holders, the bedrock of early Ottoman control in Southeast Europe, were not necessarily converts to Islam, and occasionally rebelled; the most famous of these rebels is Skanderbeg (his figure would be used later in the 19th century as a central component of Albanian national identity).
738	The most significant impact on the Albanians was the gradual Islamisation process of a large majority of the population, although such a process only became widespread in the 17th century.
738	Mainly Catholics converted in the 17th century, while the Orthodox Albanians followed suit mainly in the following century.
738	Initially confined to the main city centres of Elbasan and Shkoder, by this period the countryside was also embracing the new religion.
738	The motives for conversion according to scholars were diverse, depending on the context.
738	The lack of source material does not help when investigating such issues.
738	Albania remained under Ottoman control as part of the Rumelia province until 1912, when the first independent Albanian state was declared.
738	The formation of an Albanian national consciousness dates to the latter 19th century and is part of the larger phenomenon of the rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire.
738	Era of Nationalism The first organization that opposed the partition of Albania and pushed for greater autonomy was the League of Prizren, formed on 1 June 1878, in Prizren, Kosovo.
738	The League used military force to prevent the annexing of northern Albanian areas assigned to Montenegro and Serbia, and southern Albanian areas assigned to Greece by the Congress of Berlin.
738	After several battles with Montenegrin troops, the league was forced to give up Ulcinj to Montenegro and then was defeated by the Ottoman army sent by the Sultan in order to prevent the league from achieving autonomy for Albania.
738	The uprisings of 1910–1912, the Ottoman defeat in the Balkan Wars and the advancing Montenegrin, Serbian and Greek armies into the territories where Albanians were majority, led to the proclamation of independence by Ismail Qemali in Vlora, on 28 November 1912.
738	Independence Albania's independence was recognized by the Conference of London on 29 July 1913, but the drawing of the borders of Albania ignored the demographic realities of the time.
738	The short-lived monarchy (1914–1925) was succeeded by an even shorter-lived first Albanian Republic (1925–1928), to be replaced by another monarchy (1928–1939), which was annexed by Fascist Italy and then by Nazi Germany during World War II.
738	Communist Albania After the liberation of Albania from Nazi occupation, the country became a Communist state, the People's Republic of Albania (renamed "the People's Socialist Republic of Albania" in 1976), which was led by Enver Hoxha and the Party of Labour of Albania.
738	The socialist reconstruction of Albania after WWII and the national liberation was launched immediately after the annulling of the monarchy and the establishment of a "People's Republic".
738	In 1947, Albania's first railway line was completed, with the second completed within eight months after.
738	After new laws of land reform, land was granted to workers and peasants who tilled it.
738	Agriculture began to become cooperative labour and production increased significantly, leading to Albania becoming agriculturally self-sufficient.
738	By 1955, illiteracy was eliminated among Albania's adult population.
738	During this period Albania became industrialised and saw rapid economic growth, as well as unprecedented progress in the areas of education and ised and saw rapid economic growth, as health.
738	The average annual rate of increase of Albania's national income was 29% higher than the world average and 56% higher than the European average.
738	Also during this period, because of the monopolised socialist economy, Albania was the only country in the world that imposed no imposts or taxes on its people.
738	Hoxha's political successor Ramiz Alia oversaw the disintegration of the "Hoxhaist" state during the wider collapse of the Eastern Bloc in the later 1980s.
738	Religious freedoms were severely curtailed during this period, with many forms of worship being outlawed.
738	In August 1945, the Agrarian Reform Law meant that large swaths of property owned by religious groups (mostly Islamic waqfs) were nationalized, along with the estates of monasteries and dioceses.
738	Many believers, with the ulema, and many priests were arrested, tortured and executed.
738	In 1949, a new Decree on Religious Communities required that they and all their activities be sanctioned by the state alone.
738	In 1967 Hoxha proclaimed Albania the world's first 'atheist state'.
738	Hundreds of mosques and dozens of Islamic libraries — containing priceless manuscripts — were destroyed.
738	Churches were not spared either, and many were converted into cultural centers for young people.
738	The new law banned all "fascist, religious, warmongerish, antisocialist activity and propaganda"; preaching religion carried a three- to ten-year prison sentence.
738	Nonetheless, many Albanians continued to practice in secret.
738	Contemporary Albania The People's Republic was dissolved in 1990, and the Republic of Albania was founded in 1991.
738	The Communists retained a stronghold in parliament after popular support in the elections of 1991.
738	However, in March 1992, amid liberalisation policies resulting in economic collapse and social unrest, a new front led by the new Democratic Party took power.
738	The economic crisis spread in late 1996 following the failure of some Ponzi schemes operating in the country, peaking in 1997 in an armed rebellion that led to another mass emigration of Albanians, mostly to Italy, Greece, Switzerland, Germany and North America.
738	In 1999, the country was affected by the Kosovo War, when a great number of Albanians from Kosovo found refuge in Albania.
738	Albania became a full member of NATO in 2009.
738	The country is applying to join the European Union.
738	Albanian state flag Administrative divisions Albania is divided into 12 administrative counties ().
738	These counties include 36 districts () and 373 municipalities ().
738	There are overall 2980 villages/communities () in all Albania.
738	Each district has its council which is composed of a number of municipalities.
738	The municipalities are the first level of local governance, responsible for local needs and law enforcement.
738	Government, politics and armed forces The Albanian republic is a parliamentary democracy established under a constitution renewed in 1998.
738	Elections are held every four years to a unicameral 140-seat chamber, the People's Assembly.
738	In June 2002, a compromise candidate, Alfred Moisiu, former Army General, was elected to succeed President Rexhep Meidani.
738	Parliamentary elections in July 2005 brought Sali Berisha, the leader of the Democratic Party, while on 20 July 2007 Bamir Topi became president.
738	The current Albanian president Bujar Nishani was elected by Parliament in July 2012.
738	The Euro-Atlantic integration of Albania has been the ultimate goal of the post-communist governments.
738	Albania's EU membership bid has been set as a priority by the European Commission.
738	Albania, along with Croatia, joined NATO on 1 April 2009, becoming the 27th and 28th members of the alliance.
738	Executive branch The head of state in Albania is the President of the Republic.
738	The President is elected to a 5-year term by the Assembly of the Republic of Albania by secret ballot, requiring a 50%+1 majority of the votes of all deputies.
738	The current President of the Republic is Bujar Nishani elected on July 2012.
738	The President has the power to guarantee observation of the constitution and all laws, act as commander in chief of the armed forces, exercise the duties of the Assembly of the Republic of Albania when the Assembly is not in session, and appoint the Chairman of the Council of Ministers (prime minister).
738	Executive power rests with the Council of Ministers (cabinet).
738	The Chairman of the Council (prime minister) is appointed by the president; ministers are nominated by the president on the basis of the prime minister's recommendation.
738	The People's Assembly must give final approval of the composition of the Council.
738	The Council is responsible for carrying out both foreign and domestic policies.
738	It directs and controls the activities of the ministries and other state organs.
738	Legislative branch The Assembly of the Republic of Albania (Kuvendi i Republikës së Shqipërisë) is the lawmaking body in Albania.
738	There are 140 deputies in the Assembly, which are elected through a party-list proportional representation system.
738	The President of the Assembly (or Speaker), who has two deputies, chairs the Assembly.
738	There are 15 permanent commissions, or committees.
738	Parliamentary elections are held at least every four years.
738	The Assembly has the power to decide the direction of domestic and foreign policy; approve or amend the constitution; declare war on another state; ratify or annul international treaties; elect the President of the Republic, the Supreme Court, and the Attorney General and his or her deputies; and control the activity of state radio and television, state news agency and other official information media.
738	Armed forces The Albanian Armed Forces (Forcat e Armatosura të Shqipërisë) were first formed after independence in 1912.
738	Albania reduced the number of active troops from 65,000 in 1988 to 14,500 in 2009 and the military now consists mainly of a small fleet of aircraft and sea vessels.
738	In the 1990s, the country scrapped enormous amounts of obsolete hardware, such as tanks and SAM systems from China.
738	Today, it consists of the General Staff Headquarters, the Albanian Land Forces, Albanian Air Force, Albanian Naval Defense Forces, the Albanian Logistic Brigade and the Albanian Training and Doctrine Command.
738	Increasing the military budget was one of the most important conditions for NATO integration.
738	Military spending has generally been lower than 1.5% since 1996 only to peak in 2009 at 2% and fall again to 1.5%.
738	Since February 2008, Albania participates officially in NATO's Operation Active Endeavor in the Mediterranean Sea.
738	It received a NATO membership invitation on 3 April 2008.
738	Albania became a full member of NATO on 1 April 2009.
738	Geography Albania has a total area of 28,748 square kilometers.
738	It lies between latitudes 39° and 43° N, and mostly between longitudes 19° and 21° E (a small area lies east of 21°).
738	Albania's coastline length is 611 km and extends along the Adriatic and Ionian Seas.
738	The lowlands of the west face the Adriatic Sea.
738	The 70% of the country that is mountainous is rugged and often inaccessible from the outside.
738	The highest mountain is Korab situated in the district of Dibër, reaching up to 2753 m.
738	The climate on the coast is typically Mediterranean with mild, wet winters and warm, sunny, and rather dry summers.
738	Inland conditions vary depending on altitude, but the higher areas above 1,500 m/5,000 ft are rather cold and frequently snowy in winter; here cold conditions with snow may linger into spring.
738	Besides the capital city of Tirana, which has 800,000 inhabitants, the principal cities are Durrës, Korçë, Elbasan, Shkodër, Gjirokastër, Vlorë and Kukës.
738	In Albanian grammar, a word can have indefinite and definite forms, and this also applies to city names: both Tiranë and Tirana, Shkodër and Shkodra are used.
738	The three largest and deepest tectonic lakes of the Balkan Peninsula are partly located in Albania.
738	Lake Shkodër in the country's northwest has a surface which can vary between 370 km2 and 530 km2, out of which one third belongs to Albania and rest to Montenegro.
738	The Albanian shoreline of the lake is 57 km.
738	Ohrid Lake is situated in the country's southeast and is shared between Albania and Republic of Macedonia.
738	It has a maximal depth of 289 meters and a variety of unique flora and fauna can be found there, including "living fossils" and many endemic species.
738	Because of its natural and historical value, Ohrid Lake is under the protection of UNESCO.
738	There is also Butrinti Lake which is a small tectonic lake.
738	It is located in the national park of Butrint.
738	Climate With its coastline facing the Adriatic and Ionian seas, its highlands backed upon the elevated Balkan landmass, and the entire country lying at a latitude subject to a variety of weather patterns during the winter and summer seasons, Albania has a high number of climatic regions relative to its landmass.
738	The coastal lowlands have typically Mediterranean weather; the highlands have a Mediterranean continental climate.
738	In both the lowlands and the interior, the weather varies markedly from north to south.
738	The lowlands have mild winters, averaging about 7 °C.
738	Summer temperatures average 24 °C.
738	In the southern lowlands, temperatures average about 5 C-change higher throughout the year.
738	The difference is greater than5 C-change during the summer and somewhat less during the winter.
738	Inland temperatures are affected more by differences in elevation than by latitude or any other factor.
738	Low winter temperatures in the mountains are caused by the continental air mass that dominates the weather in Eastern Europe and the Balkans.
738	Northerly and northeasterly winds blow much of the time.
738	Average summer temperatures are lower than in the coastal areas and much lower at higher elevations, but daily fluctuations are greater.
738	Daytime maximum temperatures in the interior basins and river valleys are very high, but the nights are almost always cool.
738	Average precipitation is heavy, a result of the convergence of the prevailing airflow from the Mediterranean Sea and the continental air mass.
738	Because they usually meet at the point where the terrain rises, the heaviest rain falls in the central uplands.
738	Vertical currents initiated when the Mediterranean air is uplifted also cause frequent thunderstorms.
738	Many of these storms are accompanied by high local winds and torrential downpours.
738	When the continental air mass is weak, Mediterranean winds drop their moisture farther inland.
738	When there is a dominant continental air mass, cold air spills onto the lowland areas, which occurs most frequently in the winter.
738	Because the season's lower temperatures damage olive trees and citrus fruits, groves and orchards are restricted to sheltered places with southern and western exposures, even in areas with high average winter temperatures.
738	Lowland rainfall averages from 1000 mm to more than 1500 mm annually, with the higher levels in the north.
738	Nearly 95% of the rain falls in the winter.
738	Rainfall in the upland mountain ranges is heavier.
738	Adequate records are not available, and estimates vary widely, but annual averages are probably about 1800 mm and are as high as 2550 mm in some northern areas.
738	The western Albanian Alps (valley of Boga) are among the wettest areas in Europe, receiving some 3100 mm of rain annually.
738	The seasonal variation is not quite as great in the coastal area.
738	The higher inland mountains receive less precipitation than the intermediate uplands.
738	Terrain differences cause wide local variations, but the seasonal distribution is the most consistent of any area.
738	In 2009 an expedition from University of Colorado discovered four small glaciers in the 'Cursed' mountains in North Albania.
738	The glaciers are at the relatively low level of 2,000 meters – almost unique for such a southerly latitude.
738	Flora and fauna Although a small country, Albania is distinguished for its rich biological diversity.
738	The variation of geomorphology, climate and terrain create favorable conditions for a number of endemic and sub-endemic species with 27 endemic and 160 subendemic vascular plants present in the country.
738	The total number of plants is over 3250 species, approximately 30% of the entire flora species found in Europe.
738	Over a third of the territory of Albania – about 10,000 square kilometers (2.5 million acres)  – is forested and the country is very rich in flora.
738	About 3,000 different species of plants grow in Albania, many of which are used for medicinal purposes.Phytogeographically, Albania belongs to the Boreal Kingdom and is shared between the Adriatic and East Mediterraneanprovinces of the Mediterranean Region and the Illyrian province of the Circumboreal Region.
738	Coastal regions and lowlands have typical Mediterranean macchia vegetation, whereas oak forests and vegetation are found on higher altitudes.
738	Vast forests of black pine, beech and fir are found on higher mountains and alpine grasslands grow at altitudes above 1800 meters.
738	According to the World Wide Fund for Nature and Digital Map of European Ecological Regions by the European Environment Agency, the territory of Albania can be subdivided into three ecoregions: the Illyrian deciduous forests, Pindus Mountains mixed forests and Dinaric Alpine mixed forests.
738	The forests are home to a wide range of mammals, including wolves, bears, wild boars and chamois.
738	Lynx, wildcats, pine martens and polecats are rare, but survive in some parts of the country.
738	There are around 760 vertebrate species found so far in Albania.
738	Among these there are over 350 bird species, 330 freshwater and marine fish and 80 mammal species.
738	There are some 91 globally threatened species found within the country, among which the Dalmatian pelican, Pygmy cormorant, and the European sea sturgeon.
738	Rocky coastal regions in the south provide good habitats for the endangered Mediterranean monk seal.
738	Some of the most significant bird species found in the country include the golden eagle – known as the national symbol of Albania  – vulture species, capercaillie and numerous waterfowl.
738	The Albanian forests still maintain significant communities of large mammals such as the brown bear, gray wolf, chamois and wild boar.
738	The north and eastern mountains of the country are home to the last remaining Balkan Lynx – a critically endangered population of the Eurasian lynx.
738	Economy Albania's troubled transition from communist to free-market capitalism has been largely successful.
738	There are signs of increasing investments, and power cuts are reduced to the extent that Albania is now exporting energy.
738	Its GDP per capita (expressed in PPS—Purchasing Power Standards) stood at 28 percent of the EU average in 2010.
738	Still, Albania has shown potential for economic growth, as more and more businesses relocate there and consumer goods are becoming available from emerging market traders as part of the current massive global cost-cutting exercise.
738	Albania, Cyprus, and Poland are the only countries in Europe that recorded economic growth in the first quarter of 2010.
738	International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted 2.6% growth for Albania in 2010 and 3.2% in 2011.
738	Albania and Croatia have discussed the possibility of jointly building a nuclear power plant at Lake Shkoder, close to the border with Montenegro, a plan that has gathered criticism from Montenegro due to seismicity in the area.
738	In addition, there is some doubt whether Albania would be able to finance a project of such a scale with a total national budget of less than $5 billion.
738	However, in February 2009 Italian company Enel announced plans to build an 800 MW coal-fired power plant in Albania, to diversify electricity sources.
738	Nearly 100% of the electricity is generated by ageing hydroelectric power plants, which are becoming more ineffective due to increasing droughts.
738	The country has some deposits of petroleum and natural gas, but produced only 5,400 barrels of oil per day as of 2009.
738	Natural gas production, estimated at about 30 million cubic meters, is sufficient to meet consumer demands.
738	Other natural resources include coal, bauxite, copper and iron ore.
738	Agriculture is the most significant sector, employing some 58% of thre.
738	Tourism is gaining a fair share of Albania's GDP with visitors growing every year.
738	The workforce of Albania has continued to migrate to Greece, Italy, Germany, other parts of Europe, and North America.
738	However, the migration flux is slowly decreasing, as more and more opportunities are emerging in Albania itself as its economy steadily develops.
738	Crime and Law Enforcement Law Enforcement in Albania is primarily the responsibility of the Albanian Police.
738	Albania also has a counter-terrorism unit called RENEA.
738	On a list of 75 countries, Albania listed at 17th lowest crime rate ahead of many western nations such as Denmark, the United Kingdom, Sweden and France.
738	However, homicide is still a problem in the country, especially blood feuds in rural areas of the north, though most of these crimes are targeted at specific people and not random by passers.
738	Science and technology From 1993 human resources in sciences and technology have drastically decreased.
738	Various surveys show that during 1991–2005, approximately 50% of the professors and research scientists of the universities and science institutions in the country have emigrated.
738	However in 2009 the government approved the "National Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation in Albania" covering the period 2009–2015.
738	It aims to triple public spending on research and development (R&D) to 0.6% of GDP and augment the share of gross domestic expenditure on R&D from foreign sources, including via the European Union's Framework Programmes for Research, to the point where it covers 40% of research spending, among others.
738	Transport Highways Currently there are two main motorways in Albania: the dual carriageway connecting Durrës with Vlorë and the Albania-Kosovo Highway.
738	The Albania-Kosovo Highway links Kosovo to Albania's Adriatic coast: the Albanian side was completed in June 2009, and now it takes only two hours and a half to go from the Kosovo border to Durrës.
738	Overall the highway will be around 250 km when it reaches Pristina.
738	The project was the biggest and most expensive infrastructure project ever undertaken in Albania.
738	The cost of the highway appears to have breached €800 million, although the exact cost for the total highway has yet to be confirmed by the government.
738	Two additional highways will be built in Albania in the near future: Corridor VIII, which will link Albania with the Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria, and the north-south highway, which corresponds to the Albanian side of the Adriatic–Ionian motorway, a larger regional highway connecting Croatia with Greece along the Adriatic and Ionian coasts.
738	When all three corridors are completed Albania will have an estimated 759 kilometers of highway linking it with all its neighboring countries: Kosovo, the Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, and Greece.
738	Aviation The civil air transport in Albania marked its beginnings in November 1924, when the Republic of Albania signed a governmental agreement with German Air Company Lufthansa.
738	On the basis of a ten-year concession agreement, the Albanian Airlines Company Adria Aero Lloyd was established.
738	In the spring of 1925, the first domestic flights from Tirana to Shkoder and Vlora began.
738	In August 1927, the office of Civil Aviation of Air Traffic Ministry of Italy purchased Adria Aero Lloyd.
738	The company, now in Italian hands, expanded its flights to other cities, such as Elbasan, Korça, Kukësi, Peshkopia and Gjirokastra, and opened up international lines to Rome, Milan, Thessaloniki, Sofia, Belgrade, and Podgorica.
738	The construction of a more modern airport in Lapraka started in 1934 and was completed by the end of 1935.
738	This new airport, which was later officially named "Airport of Tirana", was constructed in conformity with optimal technological parameters of that time, with a reinforced concrete runway of 2700 m, and complemented with technical equipment and appropriate buildings.
738	During 1955–1957, the Rinasi Airport was constructed for military purposes.
738	Later, its administration was shifted to the Ministry of Transport.
738	On 25 January 1957 the State-owned Enterprise of International Air Transport (Albtransport) established its headquarters in Tirana.
738	Aeroflot, Jat Airways, Malev, Tarom and Interflug were the air companies that started to have flights with Albania until 1960.
738	During 1960–1978, several airlines ceased to operate in Albania due to the impact of the politics, resulting in a decrease of influx of flights and passengers.
738	In 1977 Albania's government signed an agreement with Greece to open the country's first air links with non-communist Europe.
738	As a result, Olympic Airways was the first non-communist airline to commercially fly into Albania after World War II.
738	By 1991 Albania had air links with many major European cities, including Paris, Rome, Zurich, Vienna and Budapest, but no regular domestic air service.
738	A French-Albanian joint venture Ada Air, was launched in Albania as the first private airline, in 1991.
738	The company offered flights in a thirty-six-passenger airplane four days a week between Tirana and Bari, Italy and a charter service for domestic and international destinations.
738	From 1989 to 1991, because of political changes in the Eastern European countries, Albania adhered to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), opened its air space to international flights, and had its duties of Air Traffic Control defined.
738	As a result of these developments, conditions were created to separate the Traffic Control defined.
738	As a activities of air traffic control from Albtransport.
738	Instead, the National Agency of Air Traffic (NATA) was established as an independent enterprise.
738	In addition, during these years, governmental agreements of civil air transport were established with countries such as Bulgaria, Germany, Slovenia, Italy, Russia, Austria, the UK and Macedonia.
738	The Directory General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) was established on 3 February 1991, to cope with the development required by the time.
738	As of 2007 Albania has one international airport: Tirana International Airport Nënë Tereza.
738	The airport is linked to 29 destinations by 14 airlines.
738	It has seen a dramatic rise in passenger numbers and aircraft movements since the early 1990s.
738	The data for 2009 is 1.3 million passengers served and an average of 44 landings and takeoffs per day.
738	Railways The railways in Albania are administered by the national railway company Hekurudha Shqiptare (HSH) (which means Albanian Railways).
738	It operates a  gauge (standard gauge) rail system in Albania.
738	All trains are hauled by Czech-built ČKD diesel-electric locomotives.
738	The railway system was extensively promoted by the totalitarian regime of Enver Hoxha, during which time the use of private transport was effectively prohibited.
738	Since the collapse of the former regime, there has been a considerable increase in car ownership and bus usage.
738	Whilst some of the country's roads are still in very poor condition, there have been other developments (such as the construction of a motorway between Tirana and Durrës) which have taken much traffic away from the railways.
738	Demographics According to the 2011 Census results, the total population of Albania is 2,821,977.
738	Its population is relatively young by European standards, with a median age of 28.9 years.
738	The fall of the Communist regime in 1990 Albania was accompanied with massive migration.
738	External migration was prohibited in Communist Albania while internal one was quite limited, hence this was a new phenomenon.
738	Between 1991 and 2004, roughly 900,000 people have migrated out of Albania, about 600,000 of them settling in Greece.
738	Migration greatly affected Albania's internal population distribution.
738	Population decreased mainly in the North and South of the country while increased in Tirana and Durrës center districts.
738	Issues of ethnicity are a delicate topic and subject to debate.
738	"Although official statistics have suggested that Albania is one of the most homogenous countries in the region (with an over 97 per cent Albanian majority) minority groups (such as Greeks, Macedonians, Montenegrins, Roma and Vlachs/Aromanians) have often questioned the official data, claiming a larger share in the country’s population."
738	The last census that contained ethnographic data (before the 2011 one) was conducted in 1989.
738	According to the 2011 census the population of Albania declared the following ethnic affiliation: Albanians 2,312,356 or 82,58%, Greeks 24,243 or 0,87%, Macedonians 5,512 or 0,20%, Montenegrins 366 or 0,01%, Aromanians 8,266 or 0,30%, Romani 8,301 or 0,30%, Balkan Egyptians 3,368 or 0,12%, Other 2,644 or 009%, Undeclared 390,938 or 13,96%, Not relevant 44,144 or 1,58%.
738	Macedonian and some Greek minority groups have sharply criticized Article 20 of the Census law, according to which a $1,000 fine will be imposed on anyone who will declare an ethnicity other than what is stated on his or her birth certificate.
738	This is claimed to be an attempt to intimidate minorities into declaring Albanian ethnicity, according to them the Albanian government has stated that it will jail anyone who does not participate in the census or refuse to declare his or her ethnicity.
738	Genc Pollo, the minister in charge has declared that: "Albanian citizens will be able to freely express their ethnic and religious affiliation and mother tongue.
738	However, they are not forced to answer these sensitive questions".
738	The amendments criticized do not include jailing or forced declaration of ethnicity or religion, only a fine is envisioned which can be overthrown by court.
738	Greek representatives part of the Albanian parliament and government invited their co-ethnics to register as the only way to improve their status.
738	On the other hand, nationalists,as well as intellectuals, various organizations and, political parties in Albania have expressed their concern that the census might artificially increase the number of Greek minority which might be then exploited by Greece and threaten Albania's territorial integrity.
738	Large parts of Albanians, similarly fear irredentist claims on northern Epirus following Albanians changing their nationality to Greek due to monetary and other benefits.
738	Albania recognizes three national minorities, Greeks, Macedonians and Montenegrins, and two cultural minorities, Aromanians and Romani people.
738	Other Albanian minorities are Bulgarians, Gorani, Serbs, Balkan Egyptians, Bosniaks and Jews.
738	Regarding the Greeks, "it is difficult to know how many Greeks there are in Albania.
738	The Greek government, it is typically claimed, says that there are around 300,000 ethnic Greeks in Albania, but most western estimates are around 200,000 mark  (although EEN puts the number at a probable 100,000).
738	The Albanian government puts the number at only 60,000."
738	The CIA World Factbook estimates the Greek minority at 3% of the total population and the US State Department uses 1.17% for Greeks and 0.23% for other minorities.
738	Language Albanian is the official language of Albania.
738	Its standard spoken and written form is revised and merged from the two main dialects, Gheg and Tosk; though, it is notably based more on the Tosk dialect.
738	Shkumbin River is the rough dividing line between the two dialects.
738	Also a dialect of Greek that preserves features now lost in standard modern Greek is spoken in areas inhabited by the Greek minority.
738	Other languages spoken by ethnic minorities in Albania include Vlach, Serbian, Macedonian, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Gorani, and Roma.
738	Macedonian is official in Pustec Municipality in East Albania.
738	According to the 2011 population census, 2,765,610 or 98.767% of the population declared Albanian as their mother tongue ("mother tongue is defined as the first or main language spoken at home during childhood").
738	Religion The 2011 Census had declared the following religious affiliations: 56.7% Islam, 10.03% Roman Catholic, 6.75% Albanian Orthodox, 5.49% Unaffiliated, 2.5% Atheist, 2.09% Bektashi, 0.14% Protestant/Evangelical.
738	Before World War II, there was given a distribution of 70% Muslims, 20% Eastern Orthodox, and 10% Roman Catholics.
738	Today, Gallup Global Reports 2010 shows that religion plays a role to 39% of Albanians, and puts Albania in the list of the 14 least religious countries in the world, with Albania the thirteenth least religious country in the world.
738	The Albanians first appear in the historical record in Byzantine sources of the late-11th century.
738	At this point, they were already fully Christianised.
738	Christianity was later overtaken by Islam during the centuries of Ottoman rule.
738	After independence (1912) from the Ottoman Empire, the Albanian republican, monarchic and later Communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life.
738	Albania never had an official state religion either as a republic or as a kingdom.
738	In the 20th century, the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy, and ultimately eradicated during the 1940s and 1950s, under the state policy of obliterating all organized religion from Albanian territories.
738	The Communist regime that took control of Albania after World War II persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely banned religion to the point where Albania was officially declared to be the world's first atheist state.
738	Religious freedom has returned to Albania since the regime's change in 1992.
738	Albanian Muslim populations (mainly secular and of the Sunni branch) are found throughout the country whereas Orthodox Christians are concentrated in the south and Roman Catholics are found in the north of the country.
738	No reliable data are available on active participation in formal religious services, but estimates range from 25% to 40%.
738	A Pew Research Center demographic study from 2009 put the percentage of Muslims in Albania at 79.9%.
738	The first recorded Albanian Protestant was Said Toptani, who traveled around Europe, and in 1853 returned to Tirana and preached Protestantism.
738	He was arrested and imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities in 1864.
738	Mainline evangelical Protestants date back to the work of Congregational and later Methodist missionaries and the work of the British and Foreign Bible Society in the 19th century.
738	The Evangelical Alliance, which is known as VUSh http://www.vush.org/ was founded in 1892.
738	Today VUSh has about 160 member congregations from different Protestant denominations.
738	VUSh organizes marches in Tirana including one against blood feuds in 2010.
738	Bibles are provided by the Interconfessional Bible Society of Albania.
738	The first full Albanian Bible to be printed was the Filipaj translation printed in 1990.
738	The Seventh-day Adventist Church sent its first missionaries into Albanian territory as early as 1909.
738	Following decades of communist repression, The Albanian Mission of Seventh-day Adventists  was re-established in Tirana in 1992 and has now over 10 churches and groups throughout the country.
738	Its humanitarian wing, the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) is renown for being the first humanitarian organization to enter post-communist Albania.
738	The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS or 'Mormons') involvement in Albania began with humanitarian aid during the 1990s.
738	The first missionaries were sent in 1992 with the Albania Tirana Mission being opened in 1996.
738	As of 2008, there were nearly 2,000 members of the LDS church in Albania, spread throughout ten branches with two purpose-built chapels and one Family History Center.
738	There are about 4,000 active Jehovah's Witnesses in Albania.
738	Culture Music and folklore Albanian folk music falls into three stylistic groups, with other important music areas around Shkodër and Tirana; the major groupings are the Ghegs of the north and southern Labs and Tosks.
738	The northern and southern traditions are contrasted by the "rugged and heroic" tone of the north and the "relaxed" form of the south.
738	These disparate styles are unified by "the intensity that both performers and listeners give to their music as a medium for patriotic expression and as a vehicle carrying the narrative of oral history", as well as certain characteristics like the use of rhythms such as 3/8, 5/8 and 10/8.
738	The first compilation of Albanian folk music was made by Pjetër Dungu in 1940.
738	Albanian folk songs can be divided into major groups, the heroic epics of the north, and the sweetly melodic lullabies, love songs, wedding music, work songs and other kinds of song.
738	The music of various festivals and holidays is also an important part of Albanian folk song, especially those that celebrate St.
738	Lazarus Day, which inaugurates the springtime.
738	Lullabies and vajtims are very important kinds of Albanian folk song, and are generally performed by solo women.
738	Albanian language and literature Albanian was proven to be an Indo-European language in 1854 by the German philologist Franz Bopp.
738	The Albanian language comprises its own branch of the Indo-European language family.
738	Some scholars believe that Albanian derives from Illyrian while others claim that it derives from Daco-Thracian.
738	Illyrian and Daco-Thracian, however, might have been closely related languages; see Thraco-Illyrian.) Establishing longer relations, Albanian is oftelosely related ln compared to Balto-Slavic on the one hand and Germanic on the other, both of which share a number of isoglosses with Albanian.
738	Moreover, Albanian has undergone a vowel shift in which stressed, long o has fallen to a, much like in the former and opposite the latter.
738	Likewise, Albanian has taken the old relative jos and innovatively used it exclusively to qualify adjectives, much in the way Balto-Slavic has used this word to provide the definite ending of adjectives.
738	The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the North, but also of the Orthodox in the South.
738	The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric Gjon Buzuku brought into the Albanian language the Catholic liturgy, trying to do for the Albanian language what Luther did for German.
738	Meshari (The Missal) by Gjon Buzuku, published in 1555, is considered the first literary work of written Albanian.
738	The refined level of the language and the stabilised orthography must be the result of an earlier tradition of written Albanian, a tradition that is not well understood.
738	However, there is some fragmented evidence, pre-dating Buzuku, which indicates that Albanian was written from at least the 14th century.
738	The earliest evidence dates from 1332 AD with a Latin report from the French Dominican Guillelmus Adae, Archbishop of Antivari, who wrote that Albanians used Latin letters in their books although their language was quite different from Latin.
738	Other significant examples include: a baptism formula (Unte paghesont premenit Atit et Birit et spertit senit) from 1462, written in Albanian within a Latin text by the Bishop of Durrës, Pal Engjëlli; a glossary of Albanian words of 1497 by Arnold von Harff, a German who had travelled through Albania, and a 15th century fragment of the Bible from the Gospel of Matthew, also in Albanian, but written in Greek letters.
738	Albanian writings from these centuries must not have been religious texts only, but historical chronicles too.
738	They are mentioned by the humanist Marin Barleti, who, in his book Rrethimi i Shkodrës (The Siege of Shkodër) (1504), confirms that he leafed through such chronicles written in the language of the people (in vernacula lingua).
738	During the 16th to 17th centuries, the catechism E mbësuame krishterë (Christian Teachings) (1592) by Lekë Matrënga, Doktrina e krishterë (The Christian Doctrine) (1618) and Rituale romanum (1621) by Pjetër Budi, the first writer of original Albanian prose and poetry, an apology for George Castriot (1636) by Frang Bardhi, who also published a dictionary and folklore creations, the theological-philosophical treaty Cuneus Prophetarum (The Band of Prophets) (1685) by Pjetër Bogdani, the most universal personality of Albanian Middle Ages, were published in Albanian.
738	The most famous Albanian writer is probably Ismail Kadare.
738	Education Before the establishment of the People's Republic, Albania's illiteracy rate was as high as 85%.
738	Schools were scarce between World War I and World War II.
738	When the People's Republic was established in 1945, the Party gave high priority to wiping out illiteracy.
738	As part of a vast social campaign, anyone between the ages of 12 and 40 who could not read or write was mandated to attend classes to learn.
738	By 1955, illiteracy was virtually eliminated among Albania's adult population.
738	Today the overall literacy rate in Albania is 98.7%; the male literacy rate is 99.2% and female literacy rate is 98.3%.
738	With large population movements in the 1990s to urban areas, the provision of education has undergone transformation as well.
738	The University of Tirana is the oldest university in Albania, founded in October 1957.
738	Sport Football is the most popular sport in Albania, both at a participatory and spectator level.
738	The sport is governed by the Football Association of Albania (, F.SH.F.), created in 1930, member of FIFA and a founding member of UEFA.
738	Other sports played include basketball, volleyball, tennis, swimming, rugby union, and gymnastics.
738	Albania national football team * Albania national basketball team * Albania national futsal team Entertainment Radio Televizioni Shqiptar (RTSH) is the public radio and TV broadcaster of Albania, founded in 1938 in Tirana.
738	RTSH runs three television stations named Televizioni Shqiptar (TVSH, TVSH 2, and TVSH Sat), and three radio stations, using the name Radio Tirana in addition to 4 regional radio stations.
738	The international service broadcasts radio programmes in Albanian and seven other languages via medium wave (AM) and short wave (SW).
738	The international service has used the theme from the song "Keputa një gjethe dafine" as its signature tune.
738	The international television service via satellite was launched since 1993 and aims at Albanian communities in Kosovo, Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro and northern Greece, plus the Albanian diaspora in the rest of Europe.
738	RTSH has a past of being heavily influenced by the ruling party in its reporting, whether that party be left or right wing.
738	According the National Council of Radio and Television (KKRT), Albania has an estimated 257 media outlets, including 66 radio stations and 67 television stations, with three national, 62 local and more than 50 cable TV stations.

746	Etymology  The name "Āzar" () means Fire and baijan was originally known as "Pāyegān" () meaning Guardian/Protector (Āzar Pāyegān = "Guardians of Fire") ().
746	Such name roots back to the Zoroastrianism era of Persia (Iran).
746	After the Muslim conquest of Persia many Persian words lost their original form as in Arabic there are no letter for pronouncing "G / P / ZH / CH"; hence, "Azar Paigān" came to be known as Azarbaijan (e.g., the Persian language in Persian is now both known as Pārsi () and Fārsi due to the Arab invasion of Greater Iran and the great resistance of Iranians around the north.
746	According to an alternate etymology, the name of Azerbaijan derives from that of Atropates, a Persian satrap under the Achaemenid Empire, who was later reinstated as the satrap of Media under Alexander the Great.
746	The original etymology of this name is thought to have its roots in the once-dominant Zoroastrian religion.
746	In the Avesta, Frawardin Yasht ("Hymn to the Guardian Angels"), there is a mention of âterepâtahe ashaonô fravashîm ýazamaide, which literally translates from Avestan as "we worship the Fravashi of the holy Atropatene".
746	Atropates ruled over the region of Atropatene (present Iranian Azerbaijan).
746	The name "Atropates" itself is the Greek transliteration of an Old Iranian, probably Median, compounded name with the meaning "Protected by the (Holy) Fire" or "The Land of the (Holy) Fire".
746	The Greek name is mentioned by Diodorus Siculus and Strabo.
746	Over the span of millennia the name evolved to Āturpātākān then to Ādharbādhagān, Ādharbāyagān, Āzarbāydjān and present-day Azerbaijan.
746	The word is translatable as "The Treasury" and "The Treasurer" of fire or "The Land of the Fire" in Modern Persian.
746	History Antiquity The earliest evidence of human settlement in the territory of Azerbaijan dates to the late Stone Age and is related to the Guruchay culture of the Azykh Cave.
746	The Upper Paleolithic and late Bronze Age cultures are attested in the caves of Tağılar, Damcılı, Zar, Yataq-yeri and in the necropolises of Leylatepe and Saraytepe.
746	Early settlements included the Scythians in the 9th century BC.
746	Following the Scythians, Iranian Medes came to dominate the area to the south of the Aras.
746	The Medes forged a vast empire between 900–700 BC, which was integrated into the Achaemenids Empire around 550 BC.
746	The area was conquered by the Achaemenids leading to the spread of Zoroastrianism.
746	Later it became part of Alexander the Great's Empire and its successor, the Seleucid Empire.
746	The Romans also settled in the area during the time of the Roman empire.
746	Caucasian Albanians, the original inhabitants of the area, established an independent kingdom around the 4th century BC.
746	During this period, Zoroastrianism spread in the Caucasus and Atropatene.
746	Ancient Azerbaijanis spoke the Old Azari language.
746	Feudal era The Sassanids turned Caucasian Albania into a vassal state in AD 252, while King Urnayr officially adopted Christianity as the state religion in the 4th century.
746	Despite numerous conquests by the Sassanids and Byzantines, Albania remained an entity in the region until the 9th century.
746	The Islamic Umayyad Caliphate repulsed both the Sassanids and Byzantines from the region and turned Caucasian Albania into a vassal state after the Christian resistance, led by King Javanshir, was suppressed in 667.
746	The power vacuum left by the decline of the Abbasid Caliphate was filled by numerous local dynasties such as the Sallarids, Sajids, Shaddadids, Rawadids and Buyids.
746	At the beginning of the 11th century, the territory was gradually seized by waves of Turkic Oghuz tribes from Central Asia.
746	The first of these Turkic dynasties established was the Ghaznavids, which entered the area now known as Azerbaijan by 1030.
746	The pre-Turkic Azerbaijani population spoke an Iranian language called the Old Azari language, which was gradually replaced by a Turkic language, now known as the Azerbaijani language from the 11th century onward until it became completely extinct in the 16th century.
746	To distinguish it from the Turkic Azerbaijani or Azeri language, this Iranian language, is designated as the Azari language (or Old Azari language), because the Turkic language and people are also designated as "Azari" in the Persian language.
746	However some linguists people are also designatedhave also designated the Tati dialects of Iranian Azerbaijan and the Republic of Azerbaijan, like those spoken by the Tats, as a remnant of Azari.
746	Locally, the possessions of the subsequent Seljuq Empire were ruled by atabegs, who were technically vassals of the Seljuq sultans, being sometimes de facto rulers themselves.
746	Under the Seljuq Turks, local poets such as Nizami Ganjavi and Khagani Shirvani gave rise to a blossoming of Persian literature on the territory of present-day Azerbaijan.
746	The next ruling state of the Jalayirids was short-lived and fell under the conquests of Timur.
746	The local dynasty of Shirvanshahs became a vassal state of Timur's Empire, and assisted him in his war with the ruler of the Golden Horde Tokhtamysh.
746	Following Timur's death two independent and rival states emerged: Kara Koyunlu and Ak Koyunlu.
746	The Shirvanshahs returned, maintaining a high degree of autonomy as local rulers and vassals from 861 until 1539.
746	During their persecution by the Safavids, the last dynasty imposed Shia Islam upon the formerly Sunni population, as it was battling against the Sunni Ottoman Empire.
746	Modern era After the Safavids, the area was ruled by the Iranian dynasties of Afshar and Zand and briefly by the Qajars.
746	However de facto self-ruling khanates emerged in the area, especially following the collapse of the Zand dynasty and in the early Qajar era.
746	The brief and successful Russian campaign of 1812 was concluded with the Treaty of Gulistan, in which the shah's claims to some of the Khanates of the Caucasus were dismissed by Russia on the ground that they had been de facto independent long before their Russian occupation.
746	The khanates exercised control over their affairs via international trade routes between Central Asia and the West.
746	Engaged in constant warfare, these khanates were eventually incorporated into the Russian Empire in 1813, following the two Russo-Persian Wars.

746	To date, the remains of 600 people have been found, including about 50 children and 100 women.
746	After the collapse of the Russian Empire during World War I, Azerbaijan, together with Armenia and Georgia became part of the short-lived Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic.
746	When the republic dissolved in May 1918, Azerbaijan declared independence as the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (ADR).
746	The ADR was the first modern parliamentary republic in the Muslim world.
746	Among the important accomplishments of the Parliament was the extension of suffrage to women, making Azerbaijan the first Muslim nation to grant women equal political rights with men.
746	Another important accomplishment of ADR was the establishment of Baku State University, which was the first modern-type university founded in Muslim East.
746	By March 1920, it was obvious that Soviet Russia would attack the much-needed Baku.
746	Vladimir Lenin said that the invasion was justified as Soviet Russia could not survive without Baku's oil.
746	Independent Azerbaijan lasted only 23 months until the Bolshevik 11th Soviet Red Army invaded it, establishing the Azerbaijan SSR on April 28, 1920.
746	Although the bulk of the newly formed Azerbaijani army was engaged in putting down an Armenian revolt that had just broken out in Karabakh, Azeris did not surrender their brief independence of 1918–20 quickly or easily.
746	As many as 20,000 Azerbaijani soldiers died resisting what was effectively a Russian reconquest.
746	On October 13, 1921, the Soviet republics of Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia signed an agreement with Turkey known as the Treaty of Kars.
746	The previously independent Naxicivan SSR would also become an autonomous ASSR within the Azerbaijan SSR by the treaty of Kars.
746	On the other hand, Armenia was awarded the region of Zangezur and Turkey agreed to return Gyumri (then known as Alexandropol).

746	Some 250,000 people from Azerbaijan were killed on the front.
746	More than 130 Azerbaijanis were named Heroes of the Soviet Union.
746	Azerbaijani Major-General Azi Aslanov was twice awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union.
746	Republic era Following the politics of glasnost, initiated by Mikhail Gorbachev, civil unrest and ethnic strife grew in various regions of the Soviet Union, including Nagorno-Karabakh, a region of the Azerbaijan SSR.
746	The disturbances in Azerbaijan, in response to Moscow's indifference to already heated conflict, resulted in calls for independence and secession, which culminated in Black January in Baku.
746	Later in 1990, the Supreme Council of the Azerbaijan SSR dropped the words "Soviet Socialist" from the title, adopted the Declaration of Sovereignty of the Azerbaijan Republic and restored flag of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic as a state flag.
746	On 18 October 1991, the Supreme Council of Azerbaijan adopted a Declaration of Independence which was affirmed by a nationwide referendum in December 1991, when the Soviet Union was officially dissolved.
746	The early years of independence were overshadowed by the Nagorno-Karabakh War with neighboring Armenia.
746	By the end of hostilities in 1994, Armenians controlled up to 16 percent of Azerbaijani territory, including Nagorno-Karabakh itself.
746	An estimated 30,000 people had been killed and more than a million had been displaced.
746	Four United Nations Security Council Resolutions (822, 853, 874, and 884) demands for "the immediate withdrawal of all Armenian forces from all occupied territories of Azerbaijan."
746	Many Russians and Armenians left Azerbaijan during the 1990s.
746	According to the 1970 census, there were 510,000 ethnic Russians and 484,000 Armenians in Azerbaijan.
746	In 1993, democratically elected president Abulfaz Elchibey was overthrown by a military insurrection led by Colonel Surat Huseynov, which resulted in the rise to power of the former leader of Soviet Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev.
746	In 1994, Surat Huseynov, by that time a prime minister, attempted another military coup against Heydar Aliyev, but Huseynov was arrested and charged with treason.
746	In 1995, another coup attempt against Aliyev, by the commander of the OMON special unit, Rovshan Javadov, was averted, resulting in the killing of the latter and disbanding of Azerbaijan's OMON units.
746	At the same time, the country was tainted by rampant corruption in the governing bureaucracy.
746	In October 1998, Aliyev was reelected for a second term.
746	Despite the much improved economy, particularly with the exploitations of Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli oil field and Shah Deniz gas field, Aliyev's presidency was criticized due to suspected vote fraud and corruption.
746	Geography Azerbaijan is in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia, straddling Western Asia and Eastern Europe.
746	It lies between latitudes 38° and 42° N, and longitudes 44° and 51° E.
746	The total length of Azerbaijan's land borders is 2648 km, of which 1007 kilometers are with Armenia, 756 kilometers with Iran, 480 kilometers with Georgia, 390 kilometers with Russia and 15 kilometers with Turkey.
746	The coastline stretches for 800 km, and the length of the widest area of the Azerbaijani section of the Caspian Sea is 456 km.
746	The territory of Azerbaijan extends 400 km from north to south, and 500 km from west to east.
746	Three physical features dominate Azerbaijan: the Caspian Sea, whose shoreline forms a natural boundary to the east; the Greater Caucasus mountain range to the north; and the extensive flatlands at the country's center.
746	There are also three mountain ranges, the Greater and Lesser Caucasus, and the Talysh Mountains, together covering approximately 40 percent of the country.
746	The highest peak of Azerbaijan is mount Bazardüzü (4,466 m), while the lowest point lies in the Caspian Sea (−28 m).
746	Nearly half of all the mud volcanoes on Earth are concentrated in Azerbaijan, which was also among nominees for New7Wonders of Nature.
746	The main water sources are the surface waters.
746	However, only 24 of the 8,350 rivers are greater than 100 km in length.
746	All the rivers drain into the Caspian Sea in the east of the country.
746	The largest lake is Sarysu (67 km²), and the longest river is Kur (1,515 km), which is transboundary.
746	Azerbaijan's four main islands in the Caspian Sea have a combined area of over thirty square kilometer.
746	Since the independence of Azerbaijan in 1991, the Azerbaijani government has taken drastic measures to preserve the environment of Azerbaijan.
746	But national protection of the environment started to truly improve after 2001 when the state budget increased due to new revenues provided by the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline.
746	Within four years protected areas doubled and now make up eight percent of the country's territory.
746	Since 2001 the government has set up seven large reserves and almost doubled the sector of the budget earmarked for environmental protection.
746	Landscape Azerbaijan is home to a vast variety of landscapes.
746	Over half of Azerbaijan's land mass consists of mountain ridges, crests, yailas, and plateaus which rise up to hypsometric levels of 400–1000 meters (including the Middle and Lower lowlands), in some places (Talis, Jeyranchol-Ajinohur and Langabiz-Alat foreranges) up to 100–120 meters, and others from 0–50 meters and up (Qobustan, Absheron).
746	The rest of Azerbaijan's terrain consist of plains and lowlands.
746	Hypsometric marks within the Caucasus region vary from about −28 meters at the Caspian Sea shoreline up to 4,466 meters (Bazardüzü peak).
746	The formation of climate in Azerbaijan is influenced particularly by cold arctic air masses of Scandinavian anticyclone, temperate of Siberian anticyclone, and Central Asian anticyclone.
746	Azerbaijan's diverse landscape affects the ways air masses enter the country.
746	The Greater Caucasus protects the country from direct influences of cold air masses coming from the north.
746	That leads to the formation of subtropical climate on most foothills and plains of the country.
746	Meanwhile, plains and foothills are characterized by high solar radiation rates.
746	Azerbaijan.
746	Both the absolute minimum temperature (  ) and the absolute maximum temperature ( 46 °C ) were observed in Julfa and Ordubad.
746	The maximum annual precipitation falls in Lankaran (1,600 to 1,800 mm) and the minimum in Absheron (200 to 350 mm).
746	Rivers and lakes form the principal part of the water systems of Azerbaijan, they were formed over a long geological timeframe and changed significantly throughout that period.
746	This is particularly evidenced by remnants of ancient rivers found throughout the country.
746	The country's water systems are continually changing under the influence of natural forces and human introduced industrial activities.
746	Artificial rivers (canals) and ponds are a part of Azerbaijan's water systems.
746	From the water supply point, Azerbaijan is below the average in the world with approximately 100,000 m³/year of water per km².
746	All big water reservoirs are built on Kur.
746	The hydrography of Azerbaijan basically belongs to the Caspian Sea basin.
746	There are 8,350 rivers of various lengths within Azerbaijan.
746	Only 24 rivers are over 100 kilometers long.
746	The Kura and Aras are the most popular rivers in Azerbaijan, they run through the Kura-Aras Lowland.
746	The rivers that directly flow into the Caspian Sea, originate mainly from the north-eastern slope of the Major Caucasus and Talysh Mountains and run along the Samur-Devechi and Lenkeran lowlands.
746	Biodiversity The first reports on the richness and diversity of animal life in Azerbaijan can be found in travel notes of Eastern travelers.
746	Animal carvings on architectural monuments, ancient rocks and stones survived up to the present times.
746	The first information on the animal kingdom of Azerbaijan was collected during the visits of naturalists to Azerbaijan in 17th century.
746	Unlike fauna, the concept of animal kingdom covers not only the types of animals, but also the number of individual species.
746	There are 106 species of mammals, 97 species of fish, 363 species of birds, 10 species of amphibians and 52 species of reptiles which have been recorded and classified in Azerbaijan.
746	The national animal of Azerbaijan is the Karabakh horse, a mountain-steppe racing and riding horse endemic to Azerbaijan.
746	The Karabakh horse has a reputation for its good temper, speed, elegance and intelligence.
746	It is one of the oldest breeds, with ancestry dating to the ancient world.
746	However today the horse is an endangered species.
746	Azerbaijan's flora consists of more than 4,500 species of higher plants.
746	Due the unique climate in Azerbaijan, the flora is much richer in the number of species than the flora of the other republics of the South Caucasus.
746	About 67 percent of the species growing in the whole Caucasus can be found in Azerbaijan.
746	Politics The structural formation of Azerbaijan's political system was completed by the adoption of the new Constitution on 12 November 1995.
746	According to the Article 23 of Constitution, the state symbols of the Azerbaijan Republic are the flag, the coat of arms and the national anthem.
746	The state power in Azerbaijan is limited only by law for internal issues, but for international affairs is additionally limited by the provisions of international agreements.
746	The government of Azerbaijan is based on the separation of powers among the legislative, executive and judicial branches.
746	The legislative power is held by the unicameral National Assembly and the Supreme National Assembly in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic.
746	Parliamentary elections are held every five years, on the first Sunday of November.
746	The Yeni Azerbaijan Party, and independents loyal to the ruling government, currently hold almost all of the Parliament's 125 seats.
746	During the 2010 Parliamentary election, the opposition parties, Musavat and Azerbaijani Popular Front Party, failed to win a single seat.
746	European observers found numerous irregularities in the run up to the election and on election day.
746	The executive power is held by the President, who is elected for a 5-year term by direct elections.
746	The president is authorized to form the Cabinet, an inferior executive body, subordinated to him.
746	The Cabinet of Azerbaijan consists primarily of the Prime Minister, his Deputies and Ministers.
746	The president does not have the right to dissolve the National Assembly, but he has the right to veto its decisions.
746	To override the presidential veto, the parliament must have a majority of 95 votes.
746	The judicial power is vested in the Constitutional Court, Supreme Court and the Economic Court.
746	The President nominates the judges in these courts.
746	The Security Council is the deliberative body under the president, and he organizes it according to the Constitution.
746	It was established on 10 April 1997.
746	The administrative department is not a part of the president's office but manages the financial, technical and pecuniary activities of both the president and his office.
746	Although Azerbaijan has held several elections since regaining its independence and it has many of the formal institutions of democracy, it remains classified as "not free" (on border with "partly free") in Freedom House's Freedom in the World 2009 survey.
746	Human rights Azerbaijan has come under heavy criticism from international bodies such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch for its record on human rights: in particular the treatment of homosexuals and the media.
746	Foreign relations The short-lived Azerbaijan Democratic Republic succeeded in establishing diplomatic relations with six countries, sending diplomatic representatives to Germany and Finland.
746	The process of international recognition of Azerbaijan's independence from the collapsing Soviet Union lasted roughly one year.
746	The most recent country to recognize Azerbaijan was Bahrain, on November 6, 1996.
746	Full diplomatic relations, including mutual exchanges of missions, were first established with Turkey, Pakistan, the United States, Iran and Israel.
746	Azerbaijan has placed a particular emphasis on its "Special Relationship" with Turkey.

746	The Government is in the process of increasing its military budget.
746	Furthermore, economic sanctions by Turkey to the west and by Azerbaijan itself to the east have combined to greatly erode Armenia's economy, leading to steep increases in prices for basic commodities and a great decline in the Armenian state revenues.

746	Military The history of the modern Azerbaijan army dates back to Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in 1918, when the National Army of the newly formed Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was created on June 26, 1918.
746	When Azerbaijan gained independence after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Armed Forces of the Republic of Azerbaijan were created according to the Law on the Armed Forces of October 9, 1991.
746	The original date of the establishment of the short-lived National Army is celebrated as Army Day (26 June) in today's Azerbaijan.
746	As of 2002, Azerbaijan had 95,000 active personnel in its armed forces.
746	There are also 17,000 paramilitary troops.
746	The armed forces have three branches: the Land Forces, the Air Forces and the Navy.
746	Additionally the armed forces embrace several military sub-groups that can be involved in state defense when needed.
746	These are the Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the State Border Service, which includes the Coast Guard as well.
746	The Azerbaijan National Guard is a further paramilitary force.
746	It operates as a semi-independent entity of the Special State Protection Service, an agency subordinate to the President.
746	Azerbaijan adheres to the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe and has signed all major international arms and weapons treaties.
746	Azerbaijan closely cooperates with NATO in programs such as Partnership for Peace and Individual Partnership Action Plan.
746	Azerbaijan has deployed 151 of its Peacekeeping Forces in Iraq and another 184 in Afghanistan.
746	The military expenditures of Azerbaijan for 2011 are set at US$4,46 billion.
746	Azerbaijani defense industry manufactures small arms, artillery systems, tanks, armors and noctovision devices, aviation bombs, pilotless vehicles, various military vehicles and military planes and helicopters.&lturl = http://www.today.az/news/business/47845.html| acce;ref> Economy After gaining independence in 1991, Azerbaijan became a member of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Islamic Development Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
746	The banking system of Azerbaijan consists of the Central Bank of Azerbaijan, commercial banks and non-banking credit organizations.
746	The National (now Central) Bank was created in 1992 based on the Azerbaijan State Savings Bank, an affiliate of the former State Savings Bank of the USSR.
746	The Central Bank serves as Azerbaijan's central bank, empowered to issue the national currency, the Azerbaijani manat, and to supervise all commercial banks.
746	Two major commercial banks are the state-owned International Bank of Azerbaijan, which is run by Dr.
746	Jahangir Hajiyev, and the UniBank.
746	Pushed up by spending and demand growth, the 2007 Q1 inflation rate reached 16.6%.
746	Nominal incomes and monthly wages climbed 29% and 25% respectively against this figure, but price increases in non-oil industry encouraged inflation in the country.
746	Azerbaijan shows some signs of the so-called "Dutch disease" because of the fast growing energy sector, which causes inflation and makes non-energy exports more expensive.
746	In the early years of this century the chronically high inflation was brought under control and this led to the launch of a new currency, the new Azerbaijani manat, on January 1, 2006, to cement the acquisition of the economic reforms and erase the vestiges of an unstable economy.
746	In 2008, Azerbaijan was cited as one of the top 10 reformers by the World Bank's Doing Business Report.
746	Azerbaijan is also ranked 57th in the Global Competitiveness Report for 2010–2011, which is above other CIS countries.
746	Energy   Two thirds of Azerbaijan is rich in oil and natural gas.
746	The region of the Lesser Caucasus accounts for most of the country's gold, silver, iron, copper, titanium, chromium, manganese, cobalt, molybdenum, complex ore and antimony.
746	In September 1994, a 30-year contract was signed between the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) and 13 oil companies, among them Amoco, BP, ExxonMobil, Lukoil and Statoil.
746	As Western oil companies are able to tap deepwater oilfields untouched by the Soviet exploitation, Azerbaijan is considered one of the most important spots in the world for oil exploration and development.
746	Meanwhile the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan was established as an extra-budgetary fund to ensure the macroeconomic stability, transparency in the management of oil revenue, and the safeguarding of resources for future generations.
746	Azeriqaz, a sub-company of SOCAR, intends to ensure full gasification of the country by 2021.
746	Banking The GDP growth rates observed in Azerbaijan during last years made the country one of the fastest growing economies in the world.
746	But the banking sector of Azerbaijan has yet to tap the vast growth potential that should be achievable due to the continuation of the high economic growth.
746	For this reason the banking sector remains small in relation to the size of the Azerbaijani economy.
746	Although in the more advanced countries banking sectors made further visible progress in the catch-up process, the Azerbaijani banking market being in an earlier stage of development, also successes in pushing forward market-oriented reform and the privatization process.
746	Still the bankingng System: An Over system is considered an important element of financial system of Azerbaijan.
746	An advanced two-stepped banking system, which is based on market principles, (the Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan in the first step, in the second one commercial banks and other non-bank credit organizations) functions in the republic.
746	Since 2002 important stage of restructuring of banking system started to be carried out.
746	Taking into consideration entry of big oil revenues in the country, as a logical result of successful oil strategy, and in this base, as the banks were ready to an effective transfer of their financial resources to the strategic goals, development strategy was made for 2002–2005.
746	Far-reaching reforms of the banking sector are conducted in the country.
746	The main challenges are due to the slow privatization rate of the state banks, a weak financial market and a lack of bank transparency.
746	However, the reforms have started showing positive resu lts and competition among the leading banks is increasing.
746	By April 1, 2010, 47 banks, 631 bank branches function in Azerbaijan.
746	One of banks was founded with participation of state capital, 23 of foreign capital.
746	To the same date, 98 non-bank credit organizations operate in the republic along with banks.
746	Growth of real money incomes of population, development of trust in bank system, improving the legal bases of protection of interests of creditors and depositors, in particular launch of ‘Deposits Insurance Fund’ were the criteria characterizing rapid growth of deposits of population.
746	As of April 1, 2010, bank deposits of population were equal to 2,4 billion AZN.
746	Along with population, bank deposits of corporative customers increase dynamically.
746	By April 1, 2010, bank deposits of corporative customers is 2,1 bn AZN.
746	Dynamic development of volume of special and involved funds of the banks has created effective conditions for enlargement of active operations.
746	As of April 1, 2010, the volume of bank assets is 12 bn AZN.
746	Crediting plays special role in structure of bank assets.
746	As of April 1, 2010, bank credits to customers is 8.5 bn AZN, which makes 70.5% of bank assets.
746	Special weight of private sector in structure of credit investments is higher than 82% (7 bn AZN).
746	Agriculture Azerbaijan has the largest agricultural basin in the region.
746	About 54,9 percent of Azerbaijan is agricultural lands.
746	At the beginning of 2007 there were 4,755,100 hectares of utilized agricultural area.
746	In the same year the total wood resources counted 136 million m³.
746	Azerbaijan's agricultural scientific research institutes are focused on meadows and pastures, horticulture and subtropical crops, green vegetables, viticulture and wine-making, cotton growing and medicinal plants.
746	In some lands it is profitable to grow grain, potatoes, sugar beets, cotton and tobacco.
746	Livestock, dairy products, and wine and spirits are also important farm products.
746	The Caspian fishing industry is concentrated on the dwindling stocks of sturgeon and beluga.
746	In 2002 the Azerbaijani merchant marine had 54 ships.
746	Some portions of most products that were previously imported from abroad have begun to be produced locally (among them are Coca Cola by Coca Cola Bottlers LTD, beer by Baki-Kastel, parquet by Nehir and oil pipes by EUPEC Pipe Coating Azerbaijan).
746	Tourism Tourism is an important part of the economy of Azerbaijan.
746	The country was a well-known tourist spot in the 1980s, yet, after the fall of the Soviet Union and the Nagorno-Karabakh War during the 1990s, damaged the tourist industry and the image of Azerbaijan as a tourist destination.
746	It was not until the 2000s that the tourism industry began to recover, and the country has since experienced a high rate of growth in the number of tourist visits and overnight stays.
746	In the recent years, Azerbaijan has also becoming a popular destination for religious, spa, and health care tourism.
746	The Government of Azerbaijan has set the development of Azerbaijan as an elite tourist destination a top priority.
746	It is a national strategy to make tourism a major, if not the single largest, contributor to the Azerbaijani economy.
746	These activities are regulated by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Azerbaijan.
746	Transportation The an|Rail transport in Azeconvenient location of Azerbaijan on the crossroad of major international traffic arteries, such as the Silk Road and the South-North corridor, highlights the strategic importance of transportation sector for the country’s economy.
746	The transport sector in the country includes roads, railways, aviation, and maritime transport.
746	Azerbaijan is also an important economic hub in the transportation of raw materials.
746	The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline (BTC) became operational in May 2006 and extends more than 1,774 kilometers through the territories of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey.
746	The BTC is designed to transport up to 50 million tons of crude oil annually and carries oil from the Caspian Sea oilfields to global markets.
746	The South Caucasus Pipeline, also stretching through the territory of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, became operational at the end of 2006 and offers additional gas supplies to the European market from the Shah Deniz gas field.
746	Shah Deniz is expected to produce up to 296 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year.
746	Azerbaijan also plays a major role in the EU-sponsored Silk Road Project.
746	In 2002, the Azerbaijani government established the Ministry of Transport with a broad range of policy and regulatory functions.
746	In the same year, the country became a member of the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic.
746	The highest priority being; upgrading the transport network and transforming transportation services into one of the key comparative advantages of the country, as this would be highly conducive to the development of other sectors of the economy.
746	In 2012, the construction of Kars–Tbilisi–Baku railway expected to provide transportation between Asia and Europe through connecting the railways of China and Kazakhstan in the east with Turkey's Marmaray to the European railway system in the west.
746	Broad gauge railways in 2010 stretched for 2918 km and electrified railways numbered 1278 km.
746	By 2010, there were 35 airports and one heliport.
746	Science and technology In the 21st century, a new oil and gas boom helped to improve the situation in the Azerbaijan's science and technology sectors, and the government launched a campaign aimed at modernization and innovation.
746	The government estimates that profits from the information technology and communication industry will grow and become comparable with those from oil production.
746	The country has also been making progress in developing its telecoms sector.
746	Nonetheless, it still faces problems.
746	These include poor infrastructure and an immature telecom regulatory regime.
746	The Ministry of Communications & Information Technologies (MCIT), as well as being an operator through its role in Aztelekom, is both a policy-maker and regulator.
746	Public pay phones are available for local calls and require the purchase of a token from the telephone exchange or some shops and kiosks.
746	Tokens allow a call of indefinite duration.
746	As of 2009, there were 1,397,000 main telephone lines and 1,485,000 internet users.
746	There are five GSM providers: Azercell, Bakcell, Azerfon (Nar Mobile), Aztrank, Catel mobile network operators and one CDMA.
746	In the 21st century a number of prominent Azerbaijani geodynamics and geotectonics scientists, inspired by the fundamental works of Elchin Khalilov and others, designed hundreds of earthquake prediction stations and earthquake-resistant buildings that now constitute the bulk of The Republican Center of Seismic Service.
746	The Azerbaijan National Aerospace Agency launched its first satellite AzerSat 1 into orbit in 7 February 2013 from Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana at orbital positions 46° East.
746	The satellite will cover Europe and significant part of Asian countries and Africa and will have transmission for TV, radio broadcasting and the internet.
746	The launch of its own satellite on orbit is Azerbaijan's first action in realizing prospective projects to turn itself into a country with a space industry.
746	Demographics From the total population of 9,165,000 people as of July 2011, nearly 52% was urban population, the remaining 48% was the rural population.
746	The sex ratio for total population in that year was therefore 0.97 males per female.
746	The 2011 population growth rate was 0.85%, compared to 1.09% worldwide.
746	A significant factor restricting the population growth is rather a high level of migration.
746	An estimated 3 million Azerbaijanis, many of them guest workers, live in Russia.
746	In 2011 Azerbaijan saw migration of −1.14/1,000 persons.
746	With 800,000 ethnic Azerbaijani refugees and IDPs, Azerbaijan has the largest internally displaced population in the region, and, as of 2006, had the highest per capita IDP population in the world.
746	The highest morbidity in 2005 was from respiratory diseases (806.9 diseases per 10,000 of total population).
746	In 2005, the highest morbidity for infectious and parasitic diseases was noted among influenza and acute respiratory infections (4168,2 per 100,000 population).
746	The Azerbaijani diaspora is found in 42 countries and in turn there are many centers for ethnic minorities inside Azerbaijan, including the German cultural society "Karelhaus", Slavic cultural center, Azerbaijani-Israeli community, Kurdish cultural center, International Talysh Association, Lezgin national center "Samur", Azerbaijani-Tatar community, Crimean Tatars society, etc.
746	The ethnic composition of the population according to the 2009 population census: 91.60% Azerbaijanis, 2.02% Lezgians, 1.35% Armenians (almost all Armenians live in the break-away region of Nagorno-Karabakh), 1.34% Russians, 1.26% Talysh, 0.56% Avars, 0.43% Turks, 0.29% Tatars, 0.28% Tats, 0.24% Ukrainians, 0.14% Tsakhurs, 0.11% Georgians, 0.10% Jews, 0.07% Kurds, other 0.21%.
746	Iranian Azerbaijanis are the largest minority in Iran.
746	The CIA World Factbook estimates Iranian Azerbaijanis as comprising nearly 16% of Iran's population.
746	Religion Around 95 percent of the population are Muslims.
746	Muslims are Shia Muslims and 15% Sunni Muslims, and the Republic of Azerbaijan has the Second highest Shia population percentage after Iran.
746	In Baku there is thran.
746	Fire Temple of Baku ("ateshgah") with an "old" structure which, according to travellers, has been a place of visit for Hindu priests for more than a millennium.
746	The place is often "misrepresented as a Zoroastrian fire-temple" due to frequent association of "fire temple" with the Iranian religion of Zoroastrianism.
746	Other faiths are practised by the country's various ethnic groups.
746	Under article 48 of its Constitution, Azerbaijan is a secular state and ensures religious freedom.
746	Of the nation's religious minorities, Christians are mostly Russian and Georgian Orthodox and Armenian Apostolic (almost all Armenians live in the break-away region of Nagorno-Karabakh).
746	In 2003, there were 250 Roman Catholics.
746	Other Christian denominations as of 2002 include Lutherans, Baptists and Molokans.
746	There are also Jewish, Bahá'í, Hare Krishna and Jehovah's Witnesses communities, as well as adherents of the Nehemiah Church, Star in the East Church and the Cathedral of Praise Church.
746	Language The official language is Azerbaijani, which belongs to the Turkic language family, spoken in southwestern Asia, primarily in Azerbaijan and Iranian Azerbaijan.
746	Azerbaijani is member of the Oghuz branch of the Turkic languages and is closely related to Turkish, Qashqa'i and Turkmen.
746	The Azerbaijani language is divided into two varieties, North Azerbaijani  and South Azerbaijani, and a large number of dialects.
746	Turkic Khalaj, Qashqa'i, and Salchuq are considered by some to be separate languages in the Azerbaijani language group.
746	Azerbaijani served as a lingua franca throughout most parts of Transcaucasia (except the Black Sea coast), in Southern Dagestan, eastern Turkey, and Iranian Azerbaijan from the 16th century to the early 20th century.
746	Although Azerbaijani (also called Azeri) is the most widely spoken language in the country and is spoken by about a quarter of the population of Iran, there are 13 other languages spoken natively in the country.
746	Some of these languages are very small communities, others are more vital.
746	Azerbaijani is mutually intelligible with Turkish and Gagauz.
746	The northern variety of the language is written with a modified Latin alphabet today, but was earlier written in the Perso-Arabic alphabet (until 1929), in the Uniform Turkic Alphabet (1929–1939), and in the Cyrillic alphabet (1939–1991).
746	The changes in alphabet have been largely molded by religious and political forces.
746	Education A relatively high percentage of Azerbaijanis have obtained some form of higher education, most notably in scientific and technical subjects.
746	In the Soviet era, literacy and average education levels rose dramatically from their very low starting point, despite two changes in the standard alphabet, from Perso-Arabic script to Latin in the 1920s and from Roman to Cyrillic in the 1930s.
746	According to Soviet data, 100 percent of males and females (ages nine to forty-nine) were literate in 1970.
746	According to the  nine to forty-nine) werUnited Nations Development Program Report 2009, the literacy rate in Azerbaijan is 99.5 percent.
746	Since independence, one of the first laws that Azerbaijan's Parliament passed to disassociate itself from the Soviet Union was to adopt a modified-Latin alphabet to replace Cyrillic.
746	Other than that the Azerbaijani system has undergone little structural change.
746	Initial alterations have included the reestablishment of religious education (banned during the Soviet period) and curriculum changes that have reemphasized the use of the Azerbaijani language and have eliminated ideological content.
746	In addition to elementary schools, the education institutions include thousands of preschools, general secondary schools, and vocational schools, including specialized secondary schools and technical schools.
746	Education through the eighth grade is compulsory.
746	Culture The culture of Azerbaijan has developed as a result of many influences.
746	Today, Western influences, including globalized consumer culture, are strong.
746	National traditions are well preserved in the country.
746	Some of the main elements of the Azerbaijani culture are: music, literature, folk dances and art, cuisine, architecture, cinematography and Novruz Bayram.
746	The latter is the traditional celebration of the ancient New Year.
746	Novruz is a family holiday.
746	Azerbaijan folk consists of Azerbaijanis, the representative part of society, as well as of nations and ethnic groups, compactly living in various areas of the country.
746	Azerbaijani national and traditional dresses are the Chokha and Papakhi.
746	There are radio broadcasts in Russian, Armenian, Georgian, Kurdish, Lezgian and Talysh languages, which are financed from the state budget.
746	Some local radio stations in Balakan and Khachmaz organize broadcasts in Avar and Tat.
746	In Baku several newspapers are published in Russian, Kurdish (Dengi Kurd), Lezgian (Samur) and Talysh languages.
746	Jewish society "Sokhnut" publishes the newspaper Aziz.
746	Music and folk dances Music of Azerbaijan builds on folk traditions that reach back nearly a thousand years.
746	For centuries Azerbaijani music has evolved under the badge of monody, producing rhythmically diverse melodies.
746	Azerbaijani music has a branchy mode system, where chromatization of major and minor scales is of great importance.
746	Among national musical instruments there are 14 string instruments, eight percussion instruments and six wind instruments.
746	According to The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, "in terms of ethnicity, culture and religion the Azeri are musically much closer to Iran than Turkey."
746	Mugham, meykhana and ashiq art are one of the many musical traditions of Azerbaijan.
746	Mugham is usually a suite with poetry and instrumental interludes.
746	When performing Mugham, the singers have to transform their emotions into singing and music.
746	Mugham singer Alim Qasimov is revered as one of the five best singers of all time.
746	In contrast to the mugham traditions of Central Asian countries, Azeri mugham is more free-form and less rigid; it is often compared to the improvised field of jazz.
746	UNESCO proclaimed the Azerbaijani mugham tradition a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity on 7 November 2003.
746	Meykhana is a kind of traditional Azeri distinctive folk unaccompanied song, usually performed by several people improvising on a particular subject.
746	Ashiq combines poetry, storytelling, dance and vocal and instrumental music into a traditional performance art that stands as a symbol of Azerbaijani culture.
746	It is a mystic troubadour or traveling bard who sings and plays the saz.
746	This tradition has its origin in the Shamanistic beliefs of ancient Turkic peoples.
746	Ashiqs' songs are semi-improvised around common bases.
746	Azerbaijan’s ashiq art was included in the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage by the UNESCO on September 30, 2009.
746	Azerbaijan made its debut appearance at the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest.
746	The country's Eurovision Song Contest.
746	The country's entry gained the third place in 2009 and fifth the following year.
746	Ell and Nikki won the first place at the Eurovision Song Contest 2011 with the song "Running Scared", entitling Azerbaijan to host the contest in 2012, in Baku.
746	There are dozens of Azerbaijani folk dances.
746	They are performed at formal celebrations and the dancers wear national clothes like the Chokha, which is well preserved within the national dances.
746	Most dances have a very fast rhythm.
746	The national dance shows the characteristics of the Azerbaijani nation.
746	Architecture Azerbaijani architecture typically combines elements of East and West.
746	Many ancient architectural treasures such as the Maiden Tower and Palace of the Shirvanshahs in the Walled City of Baku survive in modern Azerbaijan.
746	Entries submitted on the UNESCO World Heritage tentative list include the Ateshgah of Baku, Momine Khatun Mausoleum, Hirkan National Park, Binegadi National Park, Lok-Batan Mud Volcano, Baku Stage Mountain, Caspian Shore Defensive Constructions, Susha National Reserve, Ordubad National Reserve and the Palace of Shaki Khans.
746	Among other architectural treasures are Quadrangular Castle in Mardakan, Parigala in Yukhary Chardaglar, a number of bridges spanning the Aras River, and several mausoleums.
746	In the 19th and early 20th centuries, little monumental architecture was created, but distinctive residences were built in Baku and elsewhere.
746	Among the most recent architectural monuments, the Baku subways are noted for their lavish decor.
746	Plans have recently been revealed for the building of the Azerbaijan Tower.
746	It will reportedly replace the Burj Khalifa as the tallest building in the world with a planned height of 1050 m.
746	Cinematography The film industry in Azerbaijan dates back to 1898.
746	In fact, Azerbaijan was among the first countries involved in cinematography.
746	Therefore It's not surprising that this apparatus soon showed up in Baku – at the start of the 20th century, this bay town on the Caspian was producing more than 50 percent of the world's supply of oil.
746	Just like today, the oil industry attracted foreigners eager to invest and to work.
746	In 1919, during the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, a documentary The Celebration of the Anniversary of Azerbaijani Independence was filmed on Azerbaijan's independence day, May 28, and premiered in June 1919 at several theatres in Baku.
746	After the Soviet power was established in 1920, Nariman Narimanov, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Azerbaijan, signed a decree nationalizing Azerbaijan's cinema.
746	This also influenced the creation of Azerbaijani animation.
746	In 1991, after Azerbaijan gained its independence from the Soviet Union, the first Baku International Film Festival East-West was held in Baku.
746	In December 2000, the former President of Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev, signed a decree proclaiming August 2 professional holiday of filmmakers of Azerbaijan.
746	Today Azerbaijani filmmakers are again dealing with issues similar to those faced by cinematographers prior to the establishment of the Soviet Union in 1920.
746	Once again, both choice of content and sponsorship of films are largely left up to the initiative of the filmmaker.
746	There are 3 state-owned television channels: AzTV, Idman TV and Medeniyyet TV.
746	One public channel, Ictimai TV and 7 private channels: ANS TV, Space TV, Lider TV, Azad Azerbaijan TV, Xazar TV and Azerbaijan International.
746	Folk art Azerbaijanis have a rich and distinctive culture, a major part of which is decorative and applied art.
746	This form of art is represented by a wide range of handicrafts, such as chasing, jeweler, engraving in metal, carving in wood, stone and bone, carpet-making, lasing, pattern weaving and printing, knitting and embroidery.
746	Each of these types of decorative art, evidence of the and endowments of the Azerbaijan nation, is very much in favor here.
746	Many interesting facts pertaining to the development of arts and crafts in Azerbaijan were reported by numerous merchants, travelers and diplomats who had visited these places at different times.
746	The Azerbaijani carpet is a traditional handmade textile of various sizes, with dense texture and a pile or pile-less surface, whose patterns are characteristic of Azerbaijan’s many carpet-making d a pile or pile-lregions.
746	In November 2010 the Azerbaijani carpet was proclaimed a Masterpiece of Intangible Heritage by UNESCO.
746	Azerbaijan has been since the ancient times known as a center of a large variety of crafts.
746	The archeological dig on the territory of Azerbaijan testifies to the well developed agriculture, stock raising, metal working, pottery and ceramics, and last but not least carpet-weaving that date as far back as to the 2nd millennium BC.
746	Azerbaijani carpets can be categorized under several large groups and a multitude of subgroups.
746	The true scientific research of the Azerbaijani carpet is connected with the name of Latif Kerimov, a prominent scientist and artist.
746	It was his classification that related the four large groups of carpets with the four geographical zones of Azerbaijan, Guba-Shirvan, Ganja-Kazakh, Karabakh and Tabriz.
746	Cuisine The traditional cuisine is famous for an abundance of vegetables and greens used seasonally in the dishes.
746	Fresh herbs, including mint, cilantro (coriander), dill, basil, parsley, tarragon, leeks, chives, thyme, marjoram, green onion, and watercress, are very popular and often accompany main dishes on the table.
746	Climatic diversity and fertility of the land are reflected in the national dishes, which are based on fish from the Caspian Sea, local meat (mainly mutton and beef), and an abundance of seasonal vegetables and greens.
746	Saffron-rice plov is the flagship food in Azerbaijan and black tea is the national beverage.
746	Literature The earliest known figure in Azerbaijani literature was Hasanoghlu or Pur Hasan Asfaraini, who composed a divan consisting of Persian and Turkic ghazals.
746	In Persian ghazals he used his pen-name, while his Turkic ghazals were composed under his own name of Hasanoghlu.
746	Classical literature in Azerbaijani was formed in 14th century based on the various dialect Early Middle Ages dialects of Tabriz and Shirvan.
746	Among the poets of this period were Gazi Burhanaddin, Haqiqi (pen-name of Jahan-shah Qara Qoyunlu), and Habibi.
746	The end of 14th century was also the period of starting literary activity of Imadaddin Nesimi, one of the greatest Turkic Hurufi mystical poets of the late 14th and early 15th centuries and one of the most prominent early Divan masters in Turkic literary history, who also composed poetry in Persian and Arabic.
746	The Divan and Ghazal styles were further developed by poets Qasim al-Anvar, Fuzuli and Khatai (pen-name of Safavid Shah Ismail I).
746	The acclaimed Book of Dede Korkut consists of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century, was not written earlier than the 15th century.
746	It is a collection of 12 stories reflecting the oral tradition of Oghuz nomads.
746	The 16th century poet, Muhammed Fuzuli produced his timeless philosophical and lyrical Qazals in Arabic, Persian, and Azeri.
746	Benefiting immensely from the fine literary traditions of his environment, and building upon the legacy of his predecessors, Fizuli was destined to become the leading literary figure of his society.
746	His major works include The Divan of Ghazals and The Qasidas.
746	In the same century, Azerbaijani literature further flourished with the development of Ashik () poetic genre of bards.
746	During the same period, under the pen-name of Khatāī ( for sinner) Shah Ismail I wrote about 1400 verses in Azeri, which were later published as his Divan.
746	A unique literary style known as qoshma ( for improvization) was introduced in this period, and developed by Shah Ismail and later by his son and successor, Shah Tahmasp I.
746	In the span of the 17th and 18th centuries, Fizuli's unique genres as well Ashik poetry were taken up by prominent poets and writers such as Qovsi of Tabriz, Shah Abbas Sani, Agha Mesih Shirvani, Nishat, Molla Vali Vidadi, Molla Panah Vagif, Amani, Zafar and others.
746	Along with Turks, Turkmens and Uzbeks, Azeris also celebrate the Epic of Koroglu (from  for blind man's son), a legendary folk hero.
746	Several documented versions of Koroglu epic remain at the Institute for Manuscripts of the National Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan.
746	Modern literature in Azerbaijan is based on the Shirvani dialect mainly, while in Iran it is based on the Tabrizi one.
746	The first newspaper in Azerbaijani, Akinchi was published in 1875.
746	In mid-19th century, it was taught in the schools of Baku, Ganja, Shaki, Tbilisi, and Yerevan.
746	Since 1845, it has also been taught in the University of Saint Petersburg in Russia.
746	Sports Sport in Azerbaijan has ancient roots, and even now, both traditional and modern sports are still practiced.
746	Freestyle wrestling has been traditionally regarded as Azerbaijan's national sport, in which Azerbaijan won up to 14 medals, including 4 golds since joining the National Olympic Committee.
746	Even though today, the most popular sports in Azerbaijan are football and chess.
746	The national football team of Azerbaijan demonstrates relatively low performance in the international arena compared to the nation football clubs.
746	It is mainly because of the foreign footballers playing in the clubs.
746	However, the newly opened Azerbaijan Football Academy in February 2009 is a huge step in the development of the youth football.
746	The most successful Azerbaijani football clubs are Neftchi Baku, FC Baku, Inter Baku, FK Qarabağ and Khazar Lankaran.
746	In 2012, Neftchi Baku became the first Azerbaijani team to advance to the group stage of a European competition, beating APOEL of Cyprus 4-2 on aggregate in the play-off round of the 2012-13 UEFA Europa League.
746	In 2012, country also hosted the 2012 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup.
746	Futsal is another popular sport in Azerbaijan.
746	Azerbaijan national futsal team reached the fourth place in 2010 UEFA Futsal Championship, while domestic club Araz Naxçivan clinched bronze medals at 2009–10 UEFA Futsal Cup.
746	Backgammon plays a major role in Azerbaijani culture.
746	This game is very popular in Azerbaijan and is widely played among the local public.
746	There are also different variations of backgammon developed and analyzed by Azerbaijani experts.
746	Azerbaijan is known as one of the chess superpowers; despite the collapse of the Soviet Union, chess is still extremely popular.
746	Notable Azerbaijani chess players include Teimour Radjabov, Shahriyar Mammadyarov, Vladimir Makogonov, Garry Kasparov, Vugar Gashimov and Zeinab Mamedyarova.
746	Azerbaijan has also hosted many international chess tournaments and competitions and became European Team Chess Championship winners in 2009.
746	Other well-known Azerbaijani athletes are Namig Abdullayev, Toghrul Asgarov, Rovshan Bayramov, Sharif Sharifov, Mariya Stadnik and Farid Mansurov in wrestling, Ramil Guliyev and Hayle Ibrahimov in athletics, Elnur Mammadli and Movlud Miraliyev in judo, Rafael Aghayev in karate, Valeriya Korotenko and Natalya Mammadova in volleyball and K-1 fighter Zabit Samedov.
748	Amateur astronomy, also called backyard astronomy and stargazing, is a hobby whose participants enjoy watching the sky, and the abundance of objects found in it, mainly with portable telescopes and binoculars.
748	Even though scientific research is not their main goal, many amateur astronomers make a contribution to astronomy by monitoring variable stars, tracking asteroids and discovering transient objects, such as comets.
748	The typical amateur astronomer is one who does not depend on the field of astronomy as a primary source of income or support, and does not have a professional degree or advanced academic training in the subject.
748	Many amateurs are beginners or hobbyists, while others have a high degree of experience in astronomy and often assist and work alongside professional astronomers.
748	Amateur astronomy is usually associated with viewing the night sky when most celestial objects and events are visible, but sometimes amateur astronomers also operate during the day for events such as sunspots and solar eclipses.
748	Amateur astronomers often look at the sky using vents such as sunspots and solar eclipses.
748	Amateur astronnothing more than their eyes, but common tools for amateur astronomy include portable telescopes and binoculars.
748	People have studied the sky throughout history in an amateur framework, without any formal method of funding.
748	It is only within about the past century, however, that amateur astronomy has become an activity clearly distinguished from professional astronomy, and other related activities.
748	Amateur astronomy objectives  Collectively, amateur astronomers observe a variety of celestial objects and phenomena.
748	Common targets of amateur astronomers include the Moon, planets, stars, comets, meteor showers, and a variety of deep sky objects such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae.
748	Many amateurs like to specialise in observing particular objects, types of objects, or types of events which interest them.
748	One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur astrophotography, involves the taking of photos of the night sky.
748	Astrophotography has become more popular for amateurs in recent times, as relatively sophisticated equipment, such as high quality CCD cameras, has become more affordable.
748	Most amateurs work at visible wavelengths, but a small minority experiment with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum.
748	An early pioneer of radio astronomy was Grote Reber, an  amateur astronomer who constructed the first purpose built radio telescope in the late 1930s to follow up on the discovery of radio wavelength emissions from space by Karl Jansky.
748	Non-visual amateur astronomy includes the use of infrared filters on conventional telescopes, and also the use of radio telescopes.
748	Some amateur astronomers use home-made radio telescopes, while others use radio telescopes that were originally built for astronomy research but have since been made available for use by amateurs.
748	The One-Mile Telescope is one such example.
748	Common tools  Amateur astronomers use a range of instruments to study the sky, depending on a combination of their interests and resources.
748	Methods include simply looking at the night sky with the naked eye, using binoculars, and using a variety of optical telescopes of varying power and quality, as well as additional sophisticated equipment, such as cameras, to study light from the sky in both the visual and non-visual parts of the spectrum.
748	Commercial telescopes are available new and used, but in some places it is also common for amateur astronomers to build (or commission the building of) their own custom telescope.
748	Some people even focus on amateur telescope making as their primary interest within the hobby of amateur astronomy.
748	Although specialized and experienced amateur astronomers tend to acquire more specialized and more powerful equipment over time, relatively simple equipment is often preferred for certain tasks.
748	Binoculars, for instance, although generally of lower power than the majority of telescopes, also tend to provide a wider field of view, which is preferable for looking at some objects in the night sky.
748	Amateur astronomers also use star charts that, depending on experience and intentions, may range from simple planispheres through to detailed charts of very specific areas of the night sky.
748	A range of astronomy software is available and used by amateur astronomers, including software that generates maps of the sky, software to assist with astrophotography, observation scheduling software, and software to perform various calculations pertaining to astronomical phenomena.
748	Amateur astronomers often like to keep records of their observations, which usually takes the form of an observing log.
748	Observing logs typically record details about which objects were observed and when, as well as describing the details that were seen.
748	Sketching is sometimes used within logs, and photographic records of observations have also been used in recent times.
748	The Internet is an essential tool of amateur astronomers.
748	The popularity of CCD imaging among amateurs has led to large numbers of web sites being written by individuals about their images and equipment.
748	Much of the social interaction of amateur astronomy occurs on mailing lists or discussion groups.
748	Discussion group servers host numerous astronomy lists.
748	A great deal of the commerce of amateur astronomy, the buying and selling of equipment, occurs online.
748	Many amateurs use online tools to plan their nightly observing sessions using tools such as the Clear Sky Chart.
748	Common techniques  While a number of interesting celestial objects are readily identified by the naked eye, sometimes with the aid of a star chart, many others are so faint or inconspicuous that technical means are necessary to locate them.
748	Many methods are used in amateur astronomy, but most are variations of a few specific techniques.
748	Star hopping  Star hopping is a method often used by amateur astronomers with low-tech equipment such as binoculars or a manually driven telescope.
748	It involves the use of maps (or memory) to locate known landmark stars, and "hopping" between them, often with the aid of a finderscope.
748	Because of its simplicity, star hopping is a very common method for finding objects that are close to naked-eye stars.
748	More advanced methods of locating objects in the sky include telescope mounts with setting circles, which assist with pointing telescopes to positions in the sky that are known to contain objects of interest, and GOTO telescopes, which are fully automated telescopes that are capable of locating objects on demand (having first been calibrated).
748	Setting circles  Setting circles are angular measurement scales that can be placed on the two main rotation axes of some telescopes.
748	Since the widespread adoption of digital setting circles, any classical engraved setting circle is now specifically identified as an "analog setting circle" (ASC).
748	By knowing the coordinates of an object (usually given in equatorial coordinates), the telescope user can use the setting circle to align the telescope in the appropriate direction before looking through its eyepiece.
748	A computerized setting circle is called a "digital setting circle" (DSC).
748	Although digital setting circles can be used to display a telescope's RA and Dec coordinates, they are not simply a digital read-out of what can be seen on the telescope's analog setting circles.
748	As with go-to telescopes, digital setting circle computers (commercial names include Argo Navis, Sky Commander, and NGC Max) contain databases of tens of thousands of celestial objects and projections of planet positions.
748	To find an object, such as globular cluster NGC 6712, one does not need to look up the RA and Dec coordinates in a book, and then move the telescope to those numerical readings.
748	Rather, the object is chosen from the database and arrow markers appear in the display which indicate the direction to move the telescope.
748	The telescope is moved until the distance value reaches zero.
748	When both the RA and Dec axes are thus "zeroed out", the object should be in the eyepiece.
748	The user therefore does not have to go back and forth from some other database (such as a book or laptop) to match the desired object's listed coordinates to the coordinates on the telescope.
748	However, many DSCs, and also go-to systems, can work in conjunction with laptop sky programs.
748	Computerized systems provide the further advantage of computing coordinate precession.
748	Traditional printed sources are subtitled by the 'epoch year, which refers to the positions of celestial objects at a given time to the nearest year (e.g., J2005, J2007).
748	Most such printed sources have been updated for intervals of only about every fifty years (e.g., J1900, J1950, J2000).
748	Computerized sources, on the other hand, are able to calculate the right ascension and declination of the "epoch of date" to the exact instant of observation.
748	GoTo telescopes GOTO telescopes have become more popular since the 1980s as technology has improved and prices have been reduced.
748	With these computer-driven telescopes, the user typically enters the name of the item of interest and the mechanics of the telescope point the telescope towards that item automatically.
748	They have several notable advantages for amateur astronomers intent on research.
748	For example, GOTO telescopes tend to be faster for locating items of interest than star hopping, allowing more time for studying of the object.
748	GOTO also allows manufacturers to add equatorial tracking to mechanically simpler alt-azimuth telescope mounts, allowing them to produce an over all less expensive product.
748	GOTO telescopes usually have to be calibrated using alignment stars in order to provide accurate tracking and positioning.
748	However, several telescope manufacturers have recently developed telescope systems that are calibrated with the use of built-in GPS, decreasing the time it takes to set up a telescope at the start of an observing session.
748	Remote control telescopes With the development of fast Internet in the last part of the 20th century along with advances in computer controlled telescope mounts and CCD cameras 'Remote Telescope' astronomy is now a viable means for amateur astronomers not aligned with major telescope facilities to partake in research and deep sky imaging.
748	This enables anyone to control a telescope a large distance away in a dark location.
748	The observers can image through the telescopes using CCD cameras.
748	The digital data collected by the telescope is then transmitted and displayed to the user by means of the Internet.
748	An example of a digital remote telescope operation for public use via the Internet is the The Bareket Observatory.
748	Imaging techniques  Amateur astronomers engage in many imaging techniques including film and CCD astrophotography.
748	Because CCD imagers are linear, image processing may be used to subtract away the effects of light pollution, which has increased the popularity of astrophotography in urban areas.
748	Scientific research  Scientific research is most often not the main goal for many amateur astronomers, unlike professional astronomy.
748	Work of scientific merit is possible, however, and many amateurs successfully contribute to the knowledge base of professional astronomers.
748	Astronomy is sometimes promoted as one of the few remaining sciences for which amateurs can still contribute useful data.
748	To recognize this, the Astronomical Society of the Pacific annually gives Amateur Achievement Awards for significant contributions to astronomy by amateurs.
748	The majority of scientific contributions by amateur astronomers are in the area of data collection.
748	In particular, this applies where large numbers of amateur astronomers with small telescopes are more effective than the relatively small number of large telescopes that are available to professional astronomers.
748	Several organizations, such as the American Association of Variable Star Observers, exist to help coordinate these contributions.
748	Amateur astronomers often contribute toward activities such as monitoring the changes in brightness of variable stars and supernovae, helping to track asteroids, and observing occultations to determine both the shape of asteroids and the shape of the terrain on the apparent edge of the Moon as seen from Earth.
748	With more advanced equipment, but still cheap in comparison to professional setups, amateur astronomers can measure the light spectrum emitted from astronomical objects, which can yield high-quality scientific data if the measurements are performed with due care.
748	A relatively recent role for amateur astronomers is searching for overlooked phenomena (e.g., Kreutz Sungrazers) in the vast libraries of digital images and other data captured by Earth and space based observatories, much of which is available over the Internet.
748	In the past and present, amateur astronomers have played a major role in discovering new comets.
748	Recently however, funding of projects such as the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research and Near Earth Asteroid Tracking projects has meant that most comets are now discovered by automated systems, long before it is possible for amateurs to see them.
748	Societies  There is a large number of amateur astronomical societies around the world that serve as a meeting point for those interested in amateur astronomy, whether they be people who are actively interested in observing or "armchair astronomers" who may simply be interested in the topic.
748	Societies range widely in their goals, depending on a variety of factors such as geographic spread, local circumstances, size, and membership.
748	For instance, a local society in the middle of a large city may have regular meetings with speakers, focusing less on observing the night sky if the membership is less able to observe due to factors such as light pollution.
748	It is common for local societies to hold regular meetings, which may include activities such as star parties or presentations.
748	Societies are also a meeting point for people with particular interests, such as amateur telescope making.

751	Japanese martial art developed by Morihei Ueshiba as a synthesis of his martial studies, philosophy, and religious beliefs.
751	Aikido is often translated as "the Way of unifying (with) life energy" or as "the Way of harmonious spirit."
751	Ueshiba's goal was to create an art that practitioners could use to defend themselves while also protecting their awas to create an art that practitionersttacker from injury.
751	Aikido is performed by blending with the motion of the attacker and redirecting the force of the attack rather than opposing it head-on.
751	This requires very little physical strength, as the aikidōka (aikido practitioner) "leads" the attacker's momentum using entering and turning movements.
751	The techniques are completed with various throws or joint locks.
751	Aikido derives mainly from the martial art of Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu, but began to diverge from it in the late 1920s, partly due to Ueshiba's involvement with the Ōmoto-kyō religion.
751	Ueshiba's early students' documents bear the term aiki-jūjutsu.
751	Ueshiba's senior students have different approaches to aikido, depending partly on when they studied with him.
751	Today aikido is found all over the world in a number of styles, with broad ranges of interpretation and emphasis.
751	However, they all share techniques learned from Ueshiba and most have concern for the well-being of the attacker.
751	Etymology and basic philosophy The word "aikido" is formed of three kanji: *  – ai – joining, unifying, combining, fit *  – ki – spirit, energy, mood, morale *  – dō – way, path The term "aiki" does not readily appear in the Japanese language outside the scope of Budo.
751	This has led to many possible interpretations of the word.
751	There is an idea of reciprocity,  (to get to know one another),  (talk/discussion/negotiation), and  (meet by appointment).
751	I feel', as in terms of thinking but with less cognitive reasoning),  (feeling/sensation), and  (mood/morale).
751	It is used to mean energy or force, as in  (electricity) and  (magnetism).
751	The term  is also found in martial arts such as judo and kendo, and in the more peaceful arts such as Japanese calligraphy (), flower arranging () and tea ceremony ().
751	Therefore, from a purely linguistic point of view, aikido is 'Way of combining forces'.
751	The term  refers to the martial arts principle or tactic of blending with an attacker's movements for the purpose of controlling their actions with minimal effort.
751	One applies  by understanding the rhythm and intent of the attacker to find the optimal position and timing to apply a counter-technique.
751	This then is very similar to the principles expressed by Kanō Jigorō, founder of judo.
751	History Aikido was created by Morihei Ueshiba ( , 14 December 1883 – 26 April 1969), referred to by some aikido practitioners as  ("Great Teacher").
751	Ueshiba envisioned aikido not only as the synthesis of his martial training, but as an expression of his personal philosophy of universal peace and reconciliation.
751	During Ueshiba's lifetime and continuing today, aikido has evolved from the Aiki that Ueshiba studied into a wide variety of expressions by martial artists throughout the world.
751	Initial development Ueshiba developed aikido primarily during the late 1920s through the 1930s through the synthesis of the older martial arts that he had studied.
751	The core martial art from which aikido derives is Daitō-ryū aiki-jūjutsu, which Ueshiba studied directly with Takeda Sōkaku, the reviver of that art.
751	Additionally, Ueshiba is known to have studied Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū with Tozawa Tokusaburō in Tokyo in 1901, Gotōha Yagyū Shingan-ryū under Nakai Masakatsu in Sakai from 1903 to 1908, and judo with Kiyoichi Takagi ( , 1894–1972) in Tanabe in 1911.
751	The art of Daitō-ryū is the primary technical influence on aikido.
751	Along with empty-handed throwing and joint-locking techniques, Ueshiba incorporated training movements with weapons, such as those for the spear (), short staff (), and perhaps the .
751	However, aikido derives much of its technical structure from the art of swordsmanship ().
751	Ueshiba moved to Hokkaidō in 1912, and began studying under Takeda Sokaku in 1915.
751	His official association with Daitō-ryū continued until 1937.
751	However, during the latter part of that period, Ueshiba had already begun to distance himself from Takeda and the Daitō-ryū.
751	At that time Ueshiba was referring to his martial art as "Aiki Budō".
751	It is unclear exactly when Ueshiba began using the name "aikido", but it became the official name clear exactly when Ueshiba began using the name "aikido", but it became the offof the art in 1942 when the Greater Japan Martial Virtue Society () was engaged in a government sponsored reorganization and centralization of Japanese martial arts.
751	Religious influences After Ueshiba left Hokkaidō in 1919, he met and was profoundly influenced by Onisaburo Deguchi, the spiritual leader of the Ōmoto-kyō religion (a neo-Shinto movement) in Ayabe.
751	One of the primary features of Ōmoto-kyō is its emphasis on the attainment of utopia during one's life.
751	This was a great influence on Ueshiba's martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to those who seek to harm others.
751	Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it.
751	In an ideal resolution, not only is the receiver unharmed, but so is the attacker.
751	In addition to the effect on his spiritual growth, the connection with Deguchi gave Ueshiba entry to elite political and military circles as a martial artist.
751	As a result of this exposure, he was able to attract not only financial backing but also gifted students.
751	Several of these students would found their own styles of aikido.
751	International dissemination Aikido was first brought to the rest of the world in 1951 by Minoru Mochizuki with a visit to France where he introduced aikido techniques to judo students.
751	He was followed by Tadashi Abe in 1952 who came as the official Aikikai Hombu representative, remaining in France for seven years.
751	Kenji Tomiki toured with a delegation of various martial arts through 15 continental states of the United States in 1953.
751	Later in that year, Koichi Tohei was sent by Aikikai Hombu to Hawaii, for a full year, where he set up several dojo.
751	This was followed up by several further visits and is considered the formal introduction of aikido to the United States.
751	The United Kingdom followed in 1955; Italy in 1964 by Hiroshi Tada; and Germany 1965 by Katsuaki Asai.
751	Designated "Official Delegate for Europe and Africa" by Morihei Ueshiba, Masamichi Noro arrived in France in September 1961.
751	Seiichi Sugano was appointed to introduce aikido to Australia in 1965.
751	Today there are aikido dojo available throughout the world.
751	Aikido was exhibited in Hollywood films by Steven Seagal in the 1990s.
751	Proliferation of independent organizations The largest aikido organization is the Aikikai Foundation which remains under the control of the Ueshiba family.
751	However, aikido has many styles, mostly formed by Morihei Ueshiba's major students.
751	The earliest independent styles to emerge were Yoseikan Aikido, begun by Minoru Mochizuki in 1931, Yoshinkan Aikido founded by Gozo Shioda in 1955, and Shodokan Aikido, founded by Kenji Tomiki in 1967.
751	The emergence of these styles pre-dated Ueshiba's death and did not cause any major upheavals when they were formalized.
751	Shodokan Aikido, however, was controversial, since it introduced a unique rule-based competition that some felt was contrary to the spirit of aikido.
751	After Ueshiba's death in 1969, two more major styles emerged.
751	Significant controversy arose with the departure of the Aikikai Hombu Dojo's chief instructor Koichi Tohei, in 1974.
751	Tohei left as a result of a disagreement with the son of the founder, Kisshomaru Ueshiba, who at that time headed the Aikikai Foundation.
751	The disagreement was over the proper role of ki development in regular aikido training.
751	After Tohei left, he formed his own style, called Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido, and the organization which governs it, the Ki Society (Ki no Kenkyūkai).
751	A final major style evolved from Ueshiba's retirement in Iwama, Ibaraki, and the teaching methodology of long term student Morihiro Saito.
751	It is unofficially referred to as the "Iwama style", and at one point a number of its followers formed a loose network of schools they called Iwama Ryu.
751	Although Iwama style practitioners remained part of the Aikikai until Saito's death in 2002, followers of Saito subsequently split into two groups; one remaining with the Aikikai and the other forming the independent Shinshin Aikishuren Kai in 2004 around Saito's son Hitohiro Saito.
751	Today, the major styles of aikido are each run by a separate governing organization, have their own  in Japan, and have an international breadth.
751	Training In aikido, as in virtually all Japanese martial arts, there are both physical and mental aspects of training.
751	The physical training in aikido is diverse, covering both general physical fitness and conditioning, as well as specific techniques.
751	Because a substantial portion of any aikido curriculum consists of throws, the first thing most students learn is how to safely fall or roll.
751	The specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs; the techniques for defense consist of throws and pins.
751	After basic techniques are learned, students study freestyle defense against multiple opponents, and techniques with weapons.
751	Fitness Physical training goals pursued in conjunction with aikido include controlled relaxation, flexibility, and endurance, with less emphasis on strength training.
751	In aikido, pushing or extending movements are much more common than pulling or contracting movements.
751	This distinction can be applied to general fitness goals for the aikido practitioner.
751	In aikido, specific muscles or muscle groups are not isolated and worked to improve tone, mass, and power.
751	Aikido-related training emphasizes the use of coordinated whole-body movement and balance similar to yoga or pilates.
751	For example, many dojos begin each class with , which may include stretching and ukemi (break falls).
751	Roles of uke and nage Aikido training is based primarily on two partners practicing pre-arranged forms (kata) rather than freestyle practice.
751	The basic pattern is for the receiver of the technique (uke) to initiate an attack against the person who applies the technique—the  tori, or shite  (depending on aikido style), also referred to as  nage (when applying a throwing technique), who neutralises this attack with an aikido technique.
751	Both halves of the technique, that of uke and that of nage, are considered essential to aikido training.
751	Both are studying aikido principles of blending and adaptation.
751	Nage learns to blend with and control attacking energy, while uke learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous, off-balance positions in which nage places them.
751	This "receiving" of the technique is called ukemi.
751	Uke continuously seeks to regain balance and cover vulnerabilities (e.g., an exposed side), while nage uses position and timing to keep uke off-balance and vulnerable.
751	In more advanced training, uke will sometimes apply  to regain balance and pin or throw nage.
751	Good ukemi involves attention to the technique, the partner and the immediate environment—it is an active rather than a passive receiving of aikido.
751	The fall itself is part of aikido, and is a way for the practitioner to receive, safely, what would otherwise be a devastating strike or throw.
751	Initial attacks Aikido techniques are usually a defense against an attack, so students must learn to deliver various types of attacks to be able to practice aikido with a partner.
751	Although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based arts, sincere attacks (a strong strike or an immobilizing grab) are needed to study correct and effective application of technique.
751	Many of the  of aikido resemble cuts from a sword or other grasped object, which indicates its origins in techniques intended for armed combat.
751	Other techniques, which explicitly appear to be punches (tsuki), are practiced as thrusts with a knife or sword.
751	Kicks are generally reserved for upper-level variations; reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous, and that kicks (high kicks in particular) were uncommon during the types of combat prevalent in feudal Japan.
751	Some basic strikes include: *  a vertical knifehand strike to the head.
751	In training, this is usually directed at the forehead or the crown for safety, but more dangerous versions of this attack target the bridge of the nose and the maxillary sinus.
751	Specific targets include the chest, abdomen, and solar plexus.
751	Same as , and .
751	Same as .
751	Beginners in particular often practice techniques from grabs, both because they are safer and because it is easier to feel the energy and lines of force of a hold than a strike.
751	Some grabs are historically derived from being held while trying to draw a weapon; a technique could then be used to free oneself and immobilize or strike the attacker who is grabbing the defender.
751	The following are examples of some basic grabs: *  one hand grabs one wrist.
751	Same as  *  both hands grab both wrists.
751	Same as .
751	"Both-shoulders-grab" is .
751	It is sometimes combined with an overhead strike as .
751	Same as .
751	Basic techniques The following are a sample of the basic or widely practiced throws and pins.
751	Many of these techniques derive from Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu, but some others were invented by Morihei Ueshiba.
751	The precise terminology for some may vary between organisations and styles, so what follows are the terms used by the Aikikai Foundation.
751	Note that despite the names of the first five techniques listed, they are not universally taught in numeric order.
751	This grip applies pressure into the ulnar nerve at the wrist.
751	There is an adductive wristlock or Z-lock in ura version.) *  a rotational wristlock that directs upward-spiraling tension throughout the arm, elbow and shoulder.
751	The knuckles (from the palm side) are applied to the recipient's radial nerve against the periosteum of the forearm bone.
751	Common in knife and other weapon take-aways.
751	The hand is folded back past the shoulder, locking the shoulder joint.
751	The classic form superficially resembles a "clothesline" technique.
751	"earth") and the other high ("heaven"), which unbalances uke so that he or she easily topples over.
751	Nage drops his or her hips lower than those of uke, then flips uke over the resultant fulcrum.
751	The kanji for "10" is a cross-shape: 十).
751	Implementations Aikido makes use of body movement (tai sabaki) to blend with uke.
751	For example, an "entering" (irimi) technique consists of movements inward towards uke, while a  technique uses a pivoting motion.
751	Additionally, an  technique takes place in front of uke, whereas an  technique takes place to his side; a  technique is applied with motion to the front of uke, and a  version is applied with motion towards the rear of uke, usually by incorporating a turning or pivoting motion.
751	Finally, most techniques can be performed while in a seated posture (seiza).
751	Techniques where both uke and nage are standing are called tachi-waza, techniques where both start off in seiza are called suwari-waza, and techniques performed with uke standing and nage sitting are called hanmi handachi.
751	Thus, from fewer than twenty basic techniques, there are thousands of possible implementations.
751	For instance, ikkyō can be applied to an opponent moving forward with a strike (perhaps with an ura type of movement to redirect the incoming force), or to an opponent who has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish distance (perhaps an omote-waza version).
751	Specific aikido kata are typically referred to with the formula "attack-technique(-modifier)".
751	For instance, katate-dori ikkyō refers to any ikkyō technique executed when uke is holding one wrist.
751	This could be further specified as katate-dori ikkyō omote, referring to any forward-moving ikkyō technique from that grab.
751	Atemi () are strikes (or feints) employed during an aikido technique.
751	Some view atemi as attacks against "vital points" meant to cause damage in and of themselves.
751	For instance, Gōzō Shioda described using atemi in a brawl to quickly down a gang's leader.
751	Others consider atemi, especially to the face, to be methods of distraction meant to enable other techniques.
751	A strike, whether or not it is blocked, can startle the target and break his or her concentration.
751	The target may become unbalanced in attempting to avoid the blow, for example by jerking the head back, which may allow for an easier throw.
751	Many sayings about atemi are attributed to Morihei Ueshiba, who considered them an essential element of technique.
751	Weapons Weapons training in aikido traditionally includes the short staff (jō), wooden sword (bokken), and knife (tantō).
751	Today, some schools incorporate firearm-disarming techniques.
751	Both weapon-taking and weapon-retention are sometimes taught, to integrate armed and unarmed aspects.
751	Others, such as the Iwama style of Morihiro Saito, usually spend substantial time with bokken and jō, practised under the names aiki-ken, and aiki-jō, respectively.
751	The founder developed much of empty handed aikido from traditional sword and spear movements.
751	Consequently, the practice of these movements both gives insight into tl sword and spear movements.
751	Consequenhe origin of techniques and movements, and reinforces the concepts of distance, foot movement, presence and connectedness with one's training partner(s).
751	Multiple attackers and randori   One feature of aikido is training to defend against multiple attackers, often called taninzudori, or taninzugake.
751	Freestyle (randori, or jiyūwaza) practice with multiple attackers is a key part of most curricula and is required for the higher level ranks.
751	"Randori", literally "chaos", exercises a person's ability to intuitively perform techniques in an unstructured environment.
751	Strategic choice of techniques, based on how they reposition the student relative to other attackers, is important in randori training.
751	For instance, an ura technique might be used to neutralise the current attacker while turning to face attackers approaching from behind.
751	In Shodokan Aikido, randori differs in that it is not performed with multiple persons with defined roles of defender and attacker, but between two people, where both participants attack, defend, and counter at will.
751	In this respect it resembles judo randori.
751	Injuries In applying a technique during training, it is the responsibility of nage to prevent injury to uke by employing a speed and force of application that is commensurate with their partner's proficiency in ukemi.
751	Injuries (especially those to the joints), when they do occur in aikido, are often the result of nage misjudging the ability of uke to receive the throw or pin.
751	A study of injuries in the martial arts showed that while the type of injuries varied considerably from one art to the other, the differences in overall rates of injury were much less pronounced.
751	Soft tissue injuries are one of the most common types of injuries found within aikido, and a few deaths from repetitive "shihōnage" in a Japanese-style hazing context have been reported.
751	Mental training Aikido training is mental as well as physical, emphasizing the ability to relax the mind and body even under the stress of dangerous situations.
751	This is necessary to enable the practitioner to perform the bold enter-and-blend movements that underlie aikido techniques, wherein an attack is met with confidence and directness.
751	Morihei Ueshiba once remarked that one "must be willing to receive 99% of an opponent's attack and stare death in the face" in order to execute techniques without hesitation.
751	As a martial art concerned not only with fighting proficiency but with the betterment of daily life, this mental aspect is of key importance to aikido practitioners.
751	Criticisms The most common criticism of aikido is that it suffers from a lack of realism in training.
751	The attacks initiated by uke (and which nage must defend against) have been criticized as being "weak," "sloppy," and "little more than caricatures of an attack."
751	Weak attacks from uke cause a conditioned response from nage, and result in underdevelopment of the strength and conditioning needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners.
751	To counteract this, some styles allow students to become less compliant over time but, in keeping with the core philosophies, this is after having demonstrated proficiency in being able to protect themselves and their training partners.
751	Shodokan Aikido addresses the issue by practising in a competitive format.
751	Such adaptations are debated between styles, with some maintaining that there is no need to adjust their methods because either the criticisms are unjustified, or that they are not training for self-defence or combat effectiveness, but spiritual, fitness or other reasons.
751	Another criticisurl = http://www.aikidojm is that after the end of Ueshiba's seclusion in Iwama from 1942 to the mid-1950s, he increasingly emphasized the spiritual and philosophical aspects of aikido.
751	As a result, strikes to vital points by nage, entering (irimi) and initiation of techniques by nage, the distinction between omote (front side) and ura (back side) techniques, and the use of weapons, were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice.
751	Lack of training in these areas is thought to lead to an overall loss of effectiveness by some aikido practitioners.
751	Conversely, there are some who criticize aikido practitioners for not placing enough importance on the spiritual practices emphasized by Ueshiba.
751	The premise of this criticism is that "O-Sensei's aikido was not a continuation and extension of the old and has a distinct discontinuity with past martial and philosophical concepts."
751	That is, that aikido practitioners who focus on aikido's roots in traditional jujutsu or kenjutsu are diverging from what Ueshiba taught.
751	Such critics urge practitioners to embrace the assertion that "[Ueshiba's] transcendence to the spiritual and universal reality was the fundamentals  of the paradigm that he demonstrated."
751	Ki The study of ki is a critical component of aikido, and its study defies categorization as either "physical" or "mental" training, as it encompasses both.
751	The original kanji for ki was , and is a symbolic representation of a lid covering a pot full of rice; the "nourishing vapors" contained within are ki.
751	The character for ki is used in everyday Japanese terms, such as , or .
751	Ki is most often understood as unified physical and mental intention, however in traditional martial arts it is often discussed as "life energy".
751	Gōzō Shioda's Yoshinkan Aikido, considered one of the "hard styles," largely follows Ueshiba's teachings from before World War II, and surmises that the secret to ki lies in timing and the application of the whole body's strength to a single point.
751	In later years, Ueshiba's application of ki in aikido took on a softer, more gentle feel.
751	This was his Takemusu Aiki and many of his later students teach about ki from this perspective.
751	Koichi Tohei's Ki Society centers almost exclusively around the study of the empirical (albeit subjective) experience of ki with students ranked separately in aikido techniques and ki development.
751	Uniforms and ranking Aikido practitioners (commonly called aikidōka outside of Japan) generally progress by promotion through a series of "grades" (kyū), followed by a series of "degrees" (dan), pursuant to formal testing procedures.
751	Some aikido organizations use belts to distinguish practitioners' grades, often simply white and black belts to distinguish lower and higher grades, though some use various belt colors.
751	Testing requirements vary, so a particular rank in one organization is not comparable or interchangeable with the rank of another.
751	Some dojos do not allow students to take the test to obtain a dan rank unless they are 16 or older.
751	The uniform worn for practicing aikido (aikidōgi) is similar to the training uniform (keikogi) used in most other modern martial arts; simple trousers and a wraparound jacket, usually white.
751	Both thick ("judo-style"), and thin ("karate-style") cotton tops are used.
751	Aikido-specific tops are available with shorter sleeves which reach to just below the elbow.
751	Most aikido systems add a pair of wide pleated black or indigo trousers called a hakama (used also in kendo and iaido.) In many schools, its use is reserved for practitioners with (dan) ranks or for instructors, while others allow all practitioners or female practitioners to wear a hakama regardless of rank.
752	Art is a diverse range of human activities and the products of those activities; this article focuses primarily on the visual arts, which includes the creation of images or objects in fields including painting,  sculpture, printmaking, photography, and other visual media.
752	Architecture is often included as one of the visual arts; however, like the decorative arts, it involves the creation of objects where the practical considerations of use are essential—in a way that they are usually not for a painting, for example.
752	Music, theatre, film, dance, and other performing arts, as well as literature, and other media such as interactive media are included in a broader definition of art or the arts.
752	Until the 17th century, art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences, but in modern usage the fine arts, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, are distinguished from acquired skills in general, and the decorative or applied arts.
752	Art has been characterized in terms of mimesis, expression, communication of emotion, or other values.
752	During the Romantic period, art came to be seen as "a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science".
752	Though the definition of what constitutes art is disputed and has changed over time, general descriptions mention an idea of human agency and creation through imaginative or technical skill.
752	The nature of art, and related concepts such as creativity and interpretation, are explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics.
752	Creative art and fine art  By a broad definition of art, artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind: from early pre-historic art to contemporary art; however, some theories restrict the concept to modern Western societies.
752	The first and broadest sense of art is the one that has remained closest to the older Latin meaning, which roughly translates to "skill" or "craft."
752	A few examples where this meaning proves very broad include artifact, artificial, artifice, medical arts, and military arts.
752	However, there are many other colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation to its etymology.
752	In medieval philosophy, John Chrysostom held that "the name of art should be applied to those only which contribute towards and produce necessaries and mainstays of life."
752	Thomas Aquinas, when treating the adornment of women, gives an ethical justification as to why: "In the case of an art directed to the production of goods which men cannot use without sin, it follows that the workmen sin in making such things, as directly affording others an occasion of sin; for instance, if a man were to make idols or anything pertaining to idolatrous worship.
752	But in the case of an art the products of which may be employed by man either for a good or for an evil use, such as swords, arrows, and the like, the practice of such an art is not sinful.
752	These alone should be called arts."
752	Aquinas held that art is nothing else than "the right reason about certain works to be made," and that it is commendable, not for the will with which a craftman does a work, "but for the quality of the work.
752	Art, therefore, properly speaking, is an operative habit."
752	Aristotle and Aquinas distinguish it from the related habit of prudence.
752	The second and more recent sense of the word art is as an abbreviation for creative art or fine art and emerged in the early 17th century.
752	Fine art means that a skill is being used to express the artist's creativity, or to engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of the finer things.
752	The word art can refer to several things: a study of creative skill, a process of using the creative skill, a product of the creative skill, or the audience's experience with the creative skill.
752	The creative arts (art as discipline) are a collection of disciplines that produce artworks (art as objects) that are compelled by a personal drive (art as activity) and convey a message, mood, or symbolism for the viewer to interpret (art as experience).
752	Art is something that stimulates an individual's thoughts, emotions, beliefs, or ideas through the sert is somethinses.
752	Artworks can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects.
752	Although the application of scientific knowledge to derive a new scientific theory involves skill and results in the "creation" of something new, this represents science only and is not categorized as art.
752	Often, if the skill is being used in a common or practical way, people will consider it a craft instead of art.
752	Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be considered commercial art instead of fine art.
752	On the other hand, crafts and design are sometimes considered applied art.
752	Some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference.
752	However, even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression.
752	The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; to create a sense of beauty (see aesthetics); to explore the nature of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong emotions.
752	The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.
752	The nature of art has been described by philosopher Richard Wollheim as "one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture".
752	Art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas, a means for exploring and appreciating formal elements for their own sake, and as mimesis or representation.
752	Art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of Aristotle.
752	Goethe defined art as an other resp.
752	Leo Tolstoy identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another.
752	Benedetto Croce and R.G.
752	Collingwood advanced the idealist view that art expresses emotions, and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator.
752	The theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, and was developed in the early twentieth century by Roger Fry and Clive Bell.
752	More recently, thinkers influenced by Martin Heidegger have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self-expression and interpretation.
752	George Dickie has offered an institutional theory of art that defines a work of art as any artifact upon which a qualified person or persons acting on behalf of the social institution commonly referred to as "the art world" has conferred "the status of candidate for appreciation".
752	History Sculptures, cave paintings, rock paintings and petroglyphs from the Upper Paleolithic dating to roughly 40,000 years ago have been found, but the precise meaning of such art is often disputed because so little is known about the cultures that produced them.
752	The oldest art objects in the world—a series of tiny, drilled snail shells about 75,000 years old—were discovered in a South African cave.
752	Containers that may have been used to hold paints have been found dating as far back as 100,000 years.
752	Many great traditions in art have a foundation in the art of one of the great ancient civilizations: Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, India, China, Ancient Greece, Rome, as well as Inca, Maya, and Olmec.
752	Each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art.
752	Because of the size and duration of these civilizations, more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times.
752	Some also have provided the first records of how artists worked.
752	For example, this period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions.
752	In Byzantine and Medieval art of the Western Middle Ages, much art focused on the expression of Biblical and religious truths, and used styles that showed the higher glory of a heavenly world, such as the use of gold in the background of paintings, or glass in mosaics or windows, which also presented figures in idealized, patterned (flat) forms.
752	Nevertheless a classical realist tradition persisted in small Byzantine works, and realism steadily grew in the art of Catholic Europe.
752	Renaissance art had a greatly increased emphasis on the realistic depiction of the material world, and the place of humans in it, reflected in the corporeality of the human body, and development of a systematic method of graphical perspective to depict recession in a three-dimensional picture space.
752	In the east, Islamic art's rejection of iconography led to emphasis on geometric patterns, calligraphy, and architecture.
752	Further east, religion dominated artistic styles and forms too.
752	India and Tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance, while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines.
752	China saw the flourishing of many art forms: jade carving, bronzework, pottery (including the stunning terracotta army of Emperor Qin), poetry, calligraphy, music, painting, drama, fiction, etc.
752	Chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty.
752	So, for example, Tang Dynasty paintings are monochromatic and sparse, emphasizing idealized landscapes, but Ming Dynasty paintings are busy and colorful, and focus on telling stories via setting and composition.
752	Japan names its styles after imperial dynasties too, and also saw much interplay between the styles of calligraphy and painting.
752	Woodblock printing became important in Japan after the 17th century.
752	The western Age of Enlightenment in the 18th century saw artistic depictions of physical and rational certainties of the clockwork universe, as well as politically revolutionary visions of a post-monarchist world, such as Blake's portrayal of Newton as a divine geometer, or David's propagandistic paintings.
752	This led to Romantic rejections of this in favor of pictures of the emotional side and individuality of humans, exemplified in the novels of Goethe.
752	The late 19th century then saw a host of artistic movements, such as academic art, Symbolism, impressionism and fauvism among others.
752	The history of twentieth century art is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards, each being torn down in succession by the next.
752	Thus the parameters of Impressionism, Expressionism, Fauvism, Cubism, Dadaism, Surrealism, etc.
752	Increasing global interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art, such as Pablo Picasso being influenced by African sculpture.
752	Japanese woodblock prints (which had themselves been influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on Impressionism and subsequent development.
752	Later, African sculptures were taken up by Picasso and to some extent by Matisse.
752	Similarly, the west has had huge impacts on Eastern art in the 19th and 20th centuries, with originally western ideas like Communism and Post-Modernism exerting a powerful influence on artistic styles.
752	Modernism, the idealistic search for truth, gave way in the latter half of the 20th century to a realization of its unattainability.
752	Theodor W.
752	Adorno said in 1970, "It is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns art can be taken for granted any more: neither art itself, nor art in relationship to the whole, nor even the right of art to exist."
752	Relativism was accepted as an unavoidable truth, which led to the period of contemporary art and postmodern criticism, where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms, which can be appreciated and drawn from only with irony.
752	Furthermore the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue it is now more appropriate to think in terms of a global culture, rather than regional cultures.
752	Forms, genres, media, and styles The creative arts are often divided into more specific categories, each related to its technique, or medium, such as decorative arts, plastic arts, performing arts, or literature.
752	Unlike scientific fields, art is one of the few subjects that are academically organized according to technique [http://www.rchoetzlein.com/quanta/theory/theory-new-media.htm].
752	An artistic medium is the substance or material the artistic work is made from, and may also refer to the technique used.
752	For example, paint is a medium used in painting, and paper is a medium used in drawing.
752	An art form is the specific shape, or quality an artistic expression takes.
752	The media used often influence the form.
752	For example, the form of a sculpture must exist in space in three dimensions, and respond to gravity.
752	The constraints and limitations of a particular medium are thus called its formal qualities.
752	To give another example, the formal qualities of painting are the canvas texture, color, and brush texture.
752	The formal qualities of video games are non-linearity, interactivity and virtual presence.
752	The form of a particular work of art is determined by the formal qualities of the media, and is not related to the intentions of the artist or the reactions of the audience in any way whatsoever as these properties are related to content rather than form.
752	A genre is a set of conventions and styles within a particular medium.
752	For instance, well recognized genres in film are western, horror and romantic comedy.
752	Genres in music include death metal and trip hop.
752	Genres in painting include still life and pastoral landscape.
752	A particular work of art may bend or combine genres but each genre has a recognizable group of conventions, clichés and tropes.
752	One note: the word genre has a second older meaning within painting; genre painting was a phrase used in the 17th to 19th centuries to refer specifically to paintings of scenes of everyday life and is still used in this way.) The style of an artwork, artist, or movement is the distinctive method and form followed by the respective art.
752	Any loose brushy, dripped or poured abstract painting is called expressionistic.
752	Often a style is linked with a particular historical period, set of ideas, and particular artistic movement.
752	So Jackson Pollock is called an Abstract Expressionist.
752	A particular style may have specific cultural meanings.
752	For example, Roy Lichtenstein—a painter associated with the American Pop art movement of the 1960s—was not a pointillist, despite his use of dots.
752	Lichtenstein used evenly spaced Ben-Day dots (the type used to reproduce color in comic strips) as a style to question the "high" art of painting with the "low" art of comics, thus commenting on class di"high"stinctions in culture.
752	Pointillism, a technique in late Impressionism (1880s) developed especially by the artist Georges Seurat, employs dots to create variation in color and depth in an attempt to approximate the way people really see color.
752	Both artists use dots, but the particular style and technique relate to the artistic movement adopted by each artist.
752	These are all ways of beginning to define a work of art, to narrow it down.
752	"Imagine you are an art critic whose mission is to compare the meanings you find in a wide range of individual artworks.
752	How would you proceed with your task?
752	One way to begin is to examine the materials each artist selected in making an object, image video, or event.
752	The decision to cast a sculpture in bronze, for instance, inevitably effects its meaning; the work becomes something different from how it might be if it had been cast in gold or plastic or chocolate, even if everything else about the artwork remains the same.
752	Next, you might examine how the materials in each artwork have become an arrangement of shapes, colors, textures, and lines.
752	These, in turn, are organized into various patterns and compositional structures.
752	In your interpretation, you would comment on how salient features of the form contribute to the overall meaning of the finished artwork.
752	But in the end] the meaning of most artworks...
752	Most interpretations also include a discussion of the ideas and feelings the artwork engenders."
752	Skill and craft Art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a medium.
752	Art can also simply refer to the developed and efficient use of a language to convey meaning with immediacy and or depth.
752	Art is an act of expressing feelings, thoughts, and observations.
752	There is an understanding that is reached with the material as a result of handling it, which facilitates one's thought processes.
752	A common view is that the epithet "art", particular in its elevated sense, requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist, whether this be a demonstration of technical ability, an originality in stylistic approach, or a combination of these two.
752	Traditionally skill of execution was viewed as a quality inseparable from art and thus necessary for its success; for Leonardo da Vinci, art, neither more nor less than his other endeavors, was a manifestation of skill.
752	Rembrandt's work, now praised for its ephemeral virtues, was most admired by his contemporaries for its virtuosity.
752	At the turn of the 20th century, the adroit performances of John Singer Sargent were alternately admired and viewed with skepticism for their manual fluency, yet at nearly the same time the artist who would become the era's most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast, Pablo Picasso, was completing a traditional academic training at which he excelled.
752	A common contemporary criticism of some modern art occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object.
752	In conceptual art, Marcel Duchamp's "Fountain" is among the first examples of pieces wherein the artist used found objects ("ready-made") and exercised no traditionally recognised set of skills.
752	Tracey Emin's My Bed, or Damien Hirst's The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living follow this example and also manipulate the mass media.
752	Emin slept (and engaged in other activities) in her bed before placing the result in a gallery as work of art.
752	Hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork but has left most of the eventual creation of many works to employed artisans.
752	Hirst's celebrity is founded entirely on his ability to produce shocking concepts.
752	The actual production in many conceptual and contemporary works of art is a matter of assembly of found objects.
752	However there are many modernist and contemporary artists who continue to excel in the skills of drawing and painting and in creating hands-on works of art.
752	Value judgment Somewhat in relation to the above, the word art is also used to apply judgments of value, as in such expressions as "that meal was a work of art" (the cook is an artist), or "the art of deception", (the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised).
752	It is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity.
752	Making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism.
752	At the simplest level, a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered art is whether it is perceived to be attractive or repulsive.
752	Though perception is always colored by experience, and is necessarily subjective, it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying cannot be art.
752	However, "good" art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers.
752	In other words, an artist's prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic.
752	Also, art often depicts terrible images made for social, moral, or thought-provoking reasons.
752	For example, Francisco Goya's painting depicting the Spanish shootings of 3rd of May 1808 is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians.
752	Yet at the same time, the horrific imagery demonstrates Goya's keen artistic ability in composition and execution and produces fitting social and political outrage.
752	Thus, the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction, if any, is required to define 'art'.
752	The assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing.
752	Indeed, the reverse is often true, that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself.
752	Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet they all seem to agree in at least one point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the zeitgeist.
752	Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion.
752	It can arouse aesthetic or moral feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings.
752	Artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent, but they do not have to do so consciously.
752	Art may be considered an exploration of the human condition; that is, what it is to be human.
752	Purpose of art Art has had a great number of different functions throughout its history, making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept.
752	This does not imply that the purpose of Art is "vague", but that it has had many unique, different reasons for being created.
752	Some of these functions of Art are provided in the following outline.
752	The different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are non-motivated, and those that are motivated (Levi-Strauss).
752	Non-motivated functions of art The non-motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human, transcend the individual, or do not fulfill a specific external purpose.
752	In this sense, Art, as creativity, is something humans must do by their very nature (i.e., no other species creates art), and is therefore beyond utility.
752	Basic human instinct for harmony, balance, rhythm.
752	Art at this level is not an action or an object, but an internal appreciation of balance and harmony (beauty), and therefore an aspect of being human beyond utility."Imitation, then, is one instinct of our nature.
752	Next, there is the instinct for 'harmony' and rhythm, meters being manifestly sections of rhythm.
752	Persons, therefore, starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special aptitudes, till their rude improvisations gave birth to Poetry."
752	Aristotle # Experience of the mysterious.
752	Art provides a way to experience one's self in relation to the universe.
752	This experience may often come unmotivated, as one appreciates art, music or poetry."The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious.
752	It is the source of all true art and science."
752	Albert Einstein # Expression of the imagination.
752	Art provide a means to express the imagination in non-grammatic ways that are not tied to the formality of spoken or written language.
752	Unlike words, which come in sequences and each of which have a definite meaning, art provides a range of forms, symbols and ideas with meanings that are malleable."Jupiter's eagle [as an example of art] is not, like logical (aesthetic) attributes of an object, the concept of the sublimity and majesty of creation, but rather something else – something that gives the imagination an incentive to spread its flight over a whole host of kindred representations that provoke more thought than admits of expression in a concept determined by words.
752	They furnish an aesthetic idea, which serves the above rational idea as a substitute for logical presentation, but with the proper function, however, of animating the mind by opening out for it a prospect into a field of kindred representations stretching beyond its ken."
752	Immanuel Kant # Ritualistic and symbolic functions.
752	In many cultures, art is used in rituals, performances and dances as a decoration or symbol.
752	While these often have no specific utilitarian (motivated) purpose, anthropologists know that they often serve a purpose at the level of meaning within a particular culture.
752	This meaning is not furnished by any one individual, but is often the result of many generations of change, and of a cosmological relationship within the culture."Most scholars who deal with rock paintings or objects recovered from prehistoric contexts that cannot be explained in utilitarian terms and are thus categorized as decorative, ritual or symbolic, are aware of the trap posed by the term 'art'."
752	Silva Tomaskova Motivated functions of art Motivated purposes of art refer to intentional, conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator.
752	These may be to bring about political change, to comment on an aspect of society, to convey a specific emotion or mood, to address personal psychology, to illustrate another discipline, to (with commercial arts) to sell a product, or simply as a form of communication.
752	Communication.
752	Art, at its simplest, is a form of communication.
752	As most forms of communication have an intent or goal directed toward another individual, this is a motivated purpose.
752	Illustrative arts, such as scientific illustration, are a form of art as communication.
752	Maps are another example.
752	However, the content need not be scientific.
752	Emotions, moods and feelings are also communicated through art."[Art is a set of] artefacts or images with symbolic meanings as a means of communication."
752	Steve Mithen # Art as entertainment.
752	Art may seek to bring about a particular emotion or mood, for the purpose of relaxing or entertaining the viewer.
752	This is often the function of the art industries of Motion Pictures and Video Games.
752	The Avante-Garde.
752	Art for political change.
752	One of the defining functions of early twentieth century art has been to use visual images to bring about political change.
752	Art movements that had this goal—Dadaism, Surrealism, Russian Constructivism, and Abstract Expressionism, among others—are collectively referred to as the avante-garde arts."By contrast, the realistic attitude, inspired by positivism, from Saint Thomas Aquinas to Anatole France, clearly seems to me to be hostile to any intellectual or moral advancement.
752	I loathe it, for it is made up of mediocrity, hate, and dull conceit.
752	It is this attitude which today gives birth to these ridiculous books, these insulting plays.
752	It constantly feeds on and derives strength from the newspapers and stultifies both science and art by assiduously flattering the lowest of tastes; clarity bordering on stupidity, a dog's life."
752	André Breton (Surrealism) # Art for psychological and healing purposes.
752	Art is also used by art therapists, psychotherapists and clinical psychologists as art therapy.
752	The Diagnostic Drawing Series, for example, is used to determine the personality and emotional functioning of a patient.
752	The end product is not the principal goal in this case, but rather a process of healing, through creative acts, is sought.
752	The resultant piece of artwork may also offer insight into the troubles experienced by the subject and may suggest suitable approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric therapy.
752	Art for social inquiry, subversion and/or anarchy.
752	While similar to art for political change, subversive or deconstructivist art may seek to question aspects of society without any specific political goal.
752	In this case, the function of art may be simply to criticize some aspect of society.
752	Graffiti art and other types of street art are graphics and images that are spray-painted or stencilled on publicly viewable walls, buildings, buses, trains, and bridges, usually without permission.
752	Certain art forms, such as graffiti, may also be illegal when they break laws (in this case vandalism).
752	Art for social causes.
752	Art can be used to raise awarehey break laws (ness for a large variety of causes.
752	A number of art activities were aimed at raising awareness of autism, cancer, human trafficking, and a variety of other topics, such as ocean conservation, human rights in Darfur, murdered and missing Aboriginal women, elder abuse, and pollution.
752	Trashion, practiced by artists such as Marina DeBris is one example of using art to raise awareness about pollution.
752	Art for propaganda, or commercialism.
752	Art is often utilized as a form of propaganda, and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood.
752	In a similar way, art that tries to sell a product also influences mood and emotion.
752	In both cases, the purpose of art here is to subtly manipulate the viewer into a particular emotional or psychological response toward a particular idea or object.
752	Art as a fitness indicator.
752	It has been argued that the ability of the human brain by far exceeds what was needed for survival in the ancestral environment.
752	One evolutionary psychology explanation for this is that the human brain and associated traits (such as artistic ability and creativity) are the human equivalent of the peacock's tail.
752	The purpose of the male peacock's extravagant tail has been argued to be to attract females (see also Fisherian runaway and handicap principle).
752	According to this theory superior execution of art was evolutionary important because it attracted mates.
752	The functions of art described above are not mutually exclusive, as many of them may overlap.
752	For example, art for the purpose of entertainment may also seek to sell a product, i.e.
752	Public access Since ancient times, much of the finest art has represented a deliberate display of wealth or power, often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials.
752	Much art has been commissioned by rulers or religious establishments, with more modest versions only available to the most wealthy in society.
752	Nevertheless, there have been many periods where art of very high quality was available, in terms of ownership, across large parts of society, above all in cheap media such as pottery, which persists in the ground, and perishable media such as textiles and wood.
752	In many different cultures, the ceramics of indigenous peoples of the Americas are found in such a wide range of graves that they were clearly not restricted to a social elite, though other forms of art may have been.
752	Reproductive methods such as moulds made mass-production easier, and were used to bring high-quality Ancient Roman pottery and Greek Tanagra figurines to a very wide market.
752	Cylinder seals were both artistic and practical, and very widely used by what can be loosely called the middle class in the Ancient Near East.
752	Once coins were widely used these also became an artform that reached the widest range of society.
752	Another important innovation came in the 15th century in Europe, when printmaking began with small woodcuts, mostly religious, that were often very small and hand-coloured, and affordable even by peasants who glued them to the walls of their homes.
752	Printed books were initially very expensive, but fell steadily in price until by the 19th century even the poorest could afford some with printed illustrations.
752	Popular prints of many different sorts have decorated homes and other places for centuries.
752	Public buildings and monuments, secular and religious, by their nature normally address the whole of society, and visitors as viewers, and display to the general public has long been an important factor in their design.
752	Egyptian temples are typical in that the most largest and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts that could be seen by the general public, rather than the areas seen only by the priests.
752	Many areas of royal palaces, castles and the houses of the social elite were often generally accessible, and large parts of the art collections of such people could often be seen, either by anybody, or by those able to pay a small price, or those wearing the correct clothes, regardless of who they were, those abas at the Palace of Versailles, where the appropriate extra accessories (silver shoe buckles and a sword) could be hired from shops outside.
752	Special arrangements were made to allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries, as with the Orleans Collection mostly housed in a wing of the Palais Royal in Paris, which could be visited for most of the 18th century.
752	In Italy the art tourism of the Grand Tour became a major industry from the Renaissance onwards, and governments and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible.
752	The British Royal Collection remains distinct, but large donations such as the Old Royal Library were made from it to the British Museum, established in 1753.
752	The Uffizi in Florence opened entirely as a gallery in 1765, though this function had been gradually taking the building over from the original civil servants' offices for a long time before.
752	The building now occupied by the Prado in Madrid was built before the French Revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection, and similar royal galleries open to the public existed in Vienna, Munich and other capitals.
752	The opening of the Musée du Louvre during the French Revolution (in 1793) as a public museum for much of the former French royal collection certainly marked an important stage in the development of public access to art, transferring ownership to a republican state, but was a continuation of trends already well established.
752	Most modern public museums and art education programs for children in schools can be traced back to this impulse to have art available to everyone.
752	Museums in the United States tend to be gifts from the very rich to the masses (The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, for example, was created by John Taylor Johnston, a railroad executive whose personal art collection seeded the museum.) But despite all this, at least one of the important functions of art in the 21st century remains as a marker of wealth and social status.
752	There have been attempts by artists to create art that can not be bought by the wealthy as a status object.
752	One of the prime original motivators of much of the art of the late 1960s and 1970s was to create art that could not be bought and sold.
752	It is "necessary to present something more than mere objects" said the major post war German artist Joseph Beuys.
752	This time period saw the rise of such things as performance art, video art, and conceptual art.
752	The idea was that if the artwork was a performance that would leave nothing behind, or was simply an idea, it could not be bought and sold.
752	"Democratic precepts revolving around the idea that a work of art is a commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid-1960s and was reaped throughout the 1970s.
752	Artists broadly identified under the heading of Conceptual art...
752	" In the decades since, these ideas have been somewhat lost as the art market has learned to sell limited edition DVDs of video works, invitations to exclusive performance art pieces, and the objects left over from conceptual pieces.
752	Many of these performances create works that are only understood by the elite who have been educated as to why an idea or video or piece of apparent garbage may be considered art.
752	The marker of status becomes understanding the work instead of necessarily owning it, and the artwork remains an upper-class activity.
752	"With the widespread use of DVD recording technology in the early 2000s, artists, and the gallery system that derives its profits from the sale of artworks, gained an important means of controlling the sale of video and computer artworks in limited editions to collectors."
752	Controversies Art has long been controversial, that is to say disliked by some viewers, for a wide variety of reasons, though most pre-modern controversies are dimly recorded, or completely lost to a modern view.
752	Iconoclasm is the destruction of art that is disliked for a variety of reasons, including religious ones.
752	Aniconism is a general dislike of either all figurative images, or often just religious ones, and has been a thread in many major religions.
752	It has been a crucial factor in the history of Islamic art, where depictions of Muhammad remain especially controversial.
752	Much art has been disliked purely because it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers, parties or other groups.
752	Artistic conventions have often been conservative and taken very seriously by art critics, though often much less so by a wider public.
752	The iconographic content of art could cause controversy, as with late medieval depictions of the new motif of the Swoon of the Virgin in scenes of the Crucifixion of Jesus.
752	The Last Judgment by Michelangelo was controversial for various reasons, including breaches of decorum through nudity and the Apollo-like pose of Christ.
752	The content of much formal art through history was dictated by the patron or commissioner rather than just the artist, but with the advent of Romanticism, and econonomic changes in the production of art, the artists' vision became the usual determinant of the content of his art, increasing the incidence of controversies, though often reducing their significance.
752	Strong incentives for perceived originality and publicity also encouraged artists to court controversy.
752	Théodore Géricault's Raft of the Medusa (c.
752	Manet's Le Déjeuner sur l'Herbe (1863), was considered scandalous not because of the nude woman, but because she is seated next to men fully dressed in the clothing of the time, rather than in robes of the antique world.
752	John Singer Sargent's Madame Pierre Gautreau (Madam X) (1884), caused a controversy over the reddish pink used to color the woman's ear lobe, considered far too suggestive and supposedly ruining the high-society model's reputation.
752	The gradual abandonment of naturalism and the depiction of realistic representations of the visual appearance of subjects in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a rolling controversy lasting for over a century.
752	In the twentieth century, Pablo Picasso's Guernica (1937) used arresting cubist techniques and stark monochromatic oils, to depict the harrowing consequences of a contemporary bombing of a small, ancient Basque town.
752	Leon Golub's Interrogation III (1981), depicts a female nude, hooded detainee strapped to a chair, her legs open to reveal her sexual organs, surrou female nude, hoodnded by two tormentors dressed in everyday clothing.
752	Andres Serrano's Piss Christ (1989) is a photograph of a crucifix, sacred to the Christian religion and representing Christ's sacrifice and final suffering, submerged in a glass of the artist's own urine.
752	The resulting uproar led to comments in the United States Senate about public funding of the arts.
752	Theory In the nineteenth century, artists were primarily concerned with ideas of truth and beauty.
752	The aesthetic theorist John Ruskin, who championed what he saw as the naturalism of J. M. W.
752	Turner, saw art's role as the communication by artifice of an essential truth that could only be found in nature.
752	The definition and evaluation of art has become especially problematic since the 20th century.
752	Richard Wollheim distinguishes three approaches to assessing the aesthetic value of art: the Realist, whereby aesthetic quality is an absolute value independent of any human view; the Objectivist, whereby it is also an absolute value, but is dependent on general human experience; and the Relativist position, whereby it is not an absolute value, but depends on, and varies with, the human experience of different humans.
752	The arrival of Modernism in the late nineteenth century lead to a radical break in the conception of the function of art, and then again in the late twentieth century with the advent of postmodernism.
752	Clement Greenberg's 1960 article "Modernist Painting" defines modern art as "the use of characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself".
752	Greenberg originally applied this idea to the Abstract Expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat (non-illusionistic) abstract painting:  After Greenberg, several important art theorists emerged, such as Michael Fried, T. J. Clark, Rosalind Krauss, Linda Nochlin and Griselda Pollock among others.
752	Though only originally intended as a way of understanding a specific set of artists, Greenberg's definition of modern art is important to many of the ideas of art within the various art movements of the 20th century and early 21st century.
752	Pop artists like Andy Warhol became both noteworthy and influential through work including and possibly critiquing popular culture, as well as the art world.
752	Artists of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s expanded this technique of self-criticism beyond high art to all cultural image-making, including fashion images, comics, billboards and pornography.
752	Duchamp once proposed that art is any activity of any kind- everything.
752	However the way that only certain activities are classified today as art is a social construction.
752	There is evidence that there may be an element of truth to this.
752	The Invention of Art: A Cultural History is an art history book which examines the construction of the modern system of the arts i.e.
752	Fine Art.
752	Shiner finds evidence that the older system of the arts before our modern system (fine art) held art to be any skilled human activity i.e.
752	Ancient Greek society did not possess the term art but techne.
752	Techne can be understood neither as art or craft, the reason being that the distinctions of art and craft are historical products that came later on in human history.
752	Techne included painting, sculpting and music but also; cooking, medicine, horsemanship, geometry, carpentry, prophecy and farming etc.
752	Classification disputes Disputes as to whether or not to classify something as a work of art are referred to as classificatory disputes about art.
752	Classificatory disputes in the 20th century have included cubist and impressionist paintings, Duchamp's Fountain, the movies, superlative imitations of banknotes, conceptual art, and video games.
752	Philosopher David Novitz has argued that disagreement about the definition of art are rarely the heart of the problem.
752	Rather, "the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life" are "so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art" (Novitz, 1996).
752	According to Novitz, classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to go than they are about theory proper.
752	For example, when the Daily Mail criticized Hirst's and Emin's work by arguing "For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces.
752	Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all" they are not advancing a definition or theory about art, but questioning the value of Hirst's and Emin's work.
752	In 1998, Arthur Danto, suggested a thought experiment showing that "the status of an artifact as work of art results from the ideas a culture applies to it, rather than its inherent physical or perceptible qualities.
752	Cultural interpretation (an art theory of some kind) is therefore constitutive of an object's arthood."
752	Anti-art is a label for art that intentionally challenges the established parameters and values of art; it is term associated with Dadaism and attributed to Marcel Duchamp just before World War I, when he was making art from found objects.
752	One of these,  Fountain (1917), an ordinary urinal, has achieved considerable prominence and influence on art.
752	Anti-art is a feature of work by Situationist International, the lo-fi Mail art movement, and the Young British Artists, though it is a form still rejected by the Stuckists, who describe themselves as anti-anti-art.
